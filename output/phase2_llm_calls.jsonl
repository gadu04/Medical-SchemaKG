But try to get back on track quickly. Most people relapse several times before they quit for good. If you have a cigarette:\n\n- **Don't be discouraged.** Quitting smoking is difficult—a relapse doesn't mean you can't succeed.\n- **Learn from your experience.** Figure out what triggered your urge to light up and try to avoid it.\n\n[Genetics > If You Relapse > Secondhand Smoke]\nSecondhand smoke (also called passive smoking) is a combination of the smoke given off by cigarettes and the smoke exhaled by smokers. Secondhand smoke is classified as a cancer-causing agent and is responsible for about 35,000 deaths from heart disease and 3,000 deaths from lung cancer each year, primarily among nonsmoking spouses of smokers. Every year, nearly 300,000 cases of bronchitis and pneumonia in children under 18 months of age are directly linked to secondhand smoke, which is also responsible for triggering or worsening hundreds of thousands of cases of childhood asthma. Also, children who regularly breathe secondhand smoke are more likely than other children to have frequent ear infections and more dental cavities.\n\n[Genetics > If You Relapse > Medical Treatments for Quitting]\nFor smokers who are highly addicted, many doctors recommend nicotine-replacement products. These products—such as nicotine gum, pills, and patches (available over the counter) and inhalers and nasal sprays (available only by prescription)—release small amounts of nicotine into the bloodstream to relieve withdrawal symptoms from nicotine and help reduce cravings for cigarettes. These products provide safer doses of nicotine than cigarettes—the nicotine enters the body less rapidly and in a lower concentration and does not have the thousands of harmful chemicals present in cigarette smoke. Over a period of about 6 to 12 weeks, the dose of nicotine is gradually reduced to slowly lower your craving.\n\nThe prescription antidepressant medication bupropion is another proven treatment for helping people quit smoking. Bupropion, taken in pills, acts in the brain, probably by blocking nicotine receptors, preventing them from\n\ntriggering the release of the feel-good chemical dopamine (which produces the nicotine addiction). Bupropion seems to be most effective for smoking cessation in women and in people who have a history of depression. The drug can be taken along with nicotine replacement products. Together, the two treatments boost the chances of success.\n\n[Terrorism]\nFor the average American, the risk of experiencing a terrorist attack firsthand is low. However, despite the low risk, you still may feel worried and frightened during a national security alert. One positive way to cope with your anxiety and fear is to talk about your feelings with family and friends. You will find that most people share your concerns and many will appreciate the opportunity to talk about them. If you continue to feel anxious or depressed or if you are unable to focus on your usual activities, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional. You can also take constructive steps to prepare for a possible terrorist attack (see below), which can help you feel more in control.\n\nThe federal government has identified a number of possible terrorist threats and has developed a national emergency response system to coordinate local and state emergency programs throughout the country in the event of terrorist attacks. Types of attacks that could occur involve biological agents (such as bacteria and viruses), chemicals, or radioactive materials.\n\n[Terrorism > How to Prepare for a Terrorist Attack]\nIf a terrorist attack occurs, your local emergency response system will activate and local public health authorities will tell you what to do. Listen to news broadcasts to monitor the situation. Follow instructions from your local police and fire departments and from emergency workers on the scene. Although there is no way to predict exactly what might happen during a terrorist attack, there are a number of things you can do to prepare for an attack:\n\n- **Assemble emergency supplies.** Have enough bottled water (1 gallon of water per person per day) and nonperishable foods (such as canned goods, nuts, dried fruit, and boxes of dry cereal) for at least 3 days. Include a first-aid kit, extra eyeglasses and medication, vitamin and mineral supplements, tools, a battery-powered radio, a flashlight, extra batteries, a manual can opener, toilet paper, paper towels, moist towelettes, bleach, soap, and bedding and a change of clothing for each person. If you can, store extra water in containers for washing. If there is a baby in the house, include\n\nready-to-feed formula, baby food, and disposable diapers. Make a list of emergency phone numbers such as the local fire department and police department, a local hospital, and your doctor.\n\n**Develop ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "cigarette", "relation": "triggers", "tail": "urge"}, {"head": "secondhand smoke", "relation": "causes", "tail": "deaths from heart disease"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "you", "relation": "participate in", "tail": "[Event: relapse]"}, {"head": "smokers", "relation": "exhale", "tail": "[Event: secondhand smoke]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: relapse]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: quitting for good]"}, {"head": "[Event: smoking a cigarette]", "relation": "triggers", "tail": "[Event: urge to light up]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Regular exercise protects against the most common disorders—including heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, obesity, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, colon cancer, and depression—and can help you live longer. Still, more than 60 percent of adults in the US fail to get the minimum recommended amount of exercise: half an hour to an hour of moderate activity such as brisk walking on most days of the week. You don't have to do it all at one time: break up the time into 10- or 15-minute sessions scattered throughout the day. The activity you engage in doesn't have to be strenuous to provide health benefits, especially if you have been inactive for some time. Of course, the more vigorous the activity, the more you will get out of it, but what is most important is becoming more active.\n\n[PART ONE > Exercise > The Benefits of Exercise]\nIf exercise were packaged in a pill, it would be the No. 1 prescribed medication in the US—and Americans would be much healthier. Even a small increase in your physical activity can substantially reduce your health risks, especially if you have been inactive. More activity—or activity that is more vigorous—will pay even bigger rewards. In addition, regular exercise provides the following health advantages:\n\n- Lowers your risk of premature death.\n- Reduces your risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and some cancers.\n- Makes your heart pump more efficiently.\n- Fights depression and anxiety.\n- Improves strength, flexibility, and balance.\n- Helps you maintain a healthy weight.\n- Tones your muscles.\n- Helps control your appetite.\n- Keeps your mind sharp.\n- Makes you look better.\n- Boosts your self-confidence.\n\n[PART ONE > Fit Exercise Into Your Life]\nWhen you look at your busy life, a lot of things seem more important than exercise: your job, chauffeuring your kids to various activities, managing your household, or taking care of aging parents. And a lack of time may not be the only factor. Having too little money or social support—even bad weather—can all conspire against your best intentions to exercise. Here are some tips that might make it easier for you to begin an exercise program and stick with it:\n\n- Choose an exercise you enjoy.\n- Schedule time for exercise.\n- Find a workout buddy or take an exercise class.\n- Vary your activities to avoid boredom.\n- Fight inertia by remembering how good exercise makes you feel.\n\nIf you don't want to join a health club or can't make the time for a long workout several times a week, try to incorporate exercise into your daily life in the following ways to accumulate 30 to 60 minutes of exercise every day:\n\n- Climb up and down several flights of stairs at work once or twice a day.\n- Take a brisk walk after dinner.\n- Walk the dog.\n- Pull your children around the neighborhood in a wagon or sled.\n- Go to the local mall and walk.\n- Park in a parking space farther from the store or office and walk to the building.\n- Carry or push a golf bag instead of using a golf cart.\n- Wash and wax the car.\n- Do yard work.\n- Clean the house.\n- Jump rope.\n- Mow the lawn with a hand mower.\n- Lift hand weights, or do lunges, push-ups, and jumping jacks while you watch TV.\n- On the weekends, organize a family bike ride, hike, or ball game. Go swimming, ice skating, or in-line skating together. Go dancing.\n\n[PART ONE > Fit Exercise Into Your Life > Making time for exercise]\nIt's easier to fit exercise into your busy schedule if you make it part of your daily routine. Try walking up and down several flights of stairs at work every day. It takes only a few minutes and it strengthens your heart, lungs, and bones.\n\n![A man in an orange shirt and dark pants walking up a flight of stairs, illustrating the exercise mentioned in the text.]()![](_page_43_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n[PART ONE > Fit Exercise Into Your Life > Three Types of Exercise]\nThree different types of exercise—**aerobic**, **flexibility**, and **strengthening**—help you achieve different kinds of physical fitness. Aerobic exercise (such as walking, jogging, and cycling) increases your heart rate to deliver more oxygen to your muscles. Strengthening exercises (such as lifting weights and doing push-ups) build muscle and bone to increase strength. Flexibility exercises (such as stretching or yoga) improve your ability to move your joints through their full range of motion. Including all three types of activity in your exercise regimen will help you reach a high overall level of fitness that can improve your health and reduce your risk of several of the most common chronic diseases, including heart disease and diabetes.\n\nChoosing activities you enjoy will help you stay with your exercise program.

In generations past, the health benefits of regular exercise and the dangers of harmful habits such as smoking were largely unknown. Little was known about the importance of vitamins, antioxidants, fiber, or other nutrients, or the adverse effects of eating too much saturated fat. Today a wealth of information has enabled us to choose health-promoting lifestyle habits that can help us stay fit and live longer.\n\nIn this part, you will learn the basics of nutrition and how a healthful diet can help you to lower your risk of heart disease—the No. 1 killer of both men and women in the United States—as well as many of the other common chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and some cancers. The critical link between exercise and health, and how to use physical activity to maintain a sensible weight, are also explored. This part also describes ways to reduce stress and avoid harmful behaviors such as smoking and abusing alcohol or other drugs. Information on safety and preventing violence can help you protect your family both at home and when you're away. Other helpful topics discussed here include preventive health care and alternative medicine.\n\n[Terrorism > Diet and Health]\nAn unhealthy diet is a major factor contributing to the epidemics of obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer. However, diet is one of the most controllable risk factors. You can reduce your risk of developing many chronic diseases by choosing nutritious foods more often and limiting your intake of calories, fat, salt, and sugar. A healthy diet also can help you keep your weight down and your energy levels up. But what constitutes a healthy diet? Nutrition experts agree that you can reduce your risk of many diseases by consuming a diet that contains plenty of fiber-rich vegetables and fruits, an abundance of whole grains, and low-fat sources of dairy, animal, and vegetable protein. This chapter teaches you the basics of good nutrition, explains how nutritional needs change as you get older, and shows you how to improve your diet to prevent disease.\n\n[Terrorism > Eating for Good Health]\nHow do you choose nutritious foods to help your family maintain good health? Most doctors agree that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (see page 37) offer good general guidelines for healthy people. You can tailor these guidelines to meet your individual needs by working with your doctor to identify your personal health risks. As part of a thorough physical examination, your doctor will check your weight, your blood pressure, your cholesterol levels, and your blood glucose (sugar) levels. He or she will ask about your family's health history (see page 131), and calculate your body mass index (BMI; see page 11) and your waist-to-hip ratio to see how fat is distributed on your body. Using this information, you and your doctor can work together to adjust your diet to reduce your risk of disease.\n\nIf you have a high cholesterol level and a family history of heart disease, your doctor will probably suggest that you avoid or limit foods high in saturated fat and trans fats (see page 38), exercise regularly, and maintain a healthy weight. If you have a family history of diabetes or are overweight, your doctor will recommend increasing your physical activity and losing weight. If you have a family history of colon cancer or some other cancers, your doctor will recommend reducing your consumption of fat\n\n(especially animal fat), increasing your consumption of fiber-rich foods, and increasing your level of physical activity. Depending on your risk factors and your age and gender, the doctor will also tell you what screening tests you need regularly.\n\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend a diet that is low in fat (especially saturated fat and trans fats) and high in fiber-rich whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. Children under age 2 need breast milk or higher-fat dairy or soy milk or formula to ensure proper brain development. But, after age 2, they should make the transition to low-fat foods. Try to eat at least five half-cup servings of vegetables and fruits and six half-cup servings of grain products and legumes each day. It also is important to eat a wide variety of foods to make sure you are consuming as many essential nutrients as possible. When applying healthy eating principles, consider your diet over several days, but choose wisely meal by meal. Choose low-fat, high-fiber foods more often and use low-fat cooking methods such as broiling and grilling instead of frying.\n\nYou don't have to eliminate your favorite high-fat snacks, desserts, or fast foods altogether. If you occasionally indulge in pizza, a burger, or a dish of ice cream, enjoy it.

You could feel pain in any of the areas of the body shown here, or you could feel pain in only your arms, jaw, or back. Women's symptoms, especially, can vary considerably from the classic signs of a heart attack. Women are more likely than men to experience dizziness, nausea, sweating, weakness, and faintness along with chest pain.\n\nChest pain that spreads to your neck or jaw\n\n![Diagram showing a person with pain radiating from the chest area (red shading) to the neck and jaw.]()![](_page_76_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\nCrushing pain in your chest that radiates to your left shoulder\n\n![Diagram showing a person with pain radiating from the chest area (red shading) to the left shoulder.]()![](_page_76_Picture_6.jpeg)\n\nDeep, dull pain or a tight, heavy, or squeezing sensation under your breastbone\n\n![Diagram showing a person with a red vertical bar indicating chest pain.]()![](_page_77_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nChest pain that spreads to your back\n\n![Diagram showing a person with a red vertical bar indicating pain radiating to the back.]()![](_page_77_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\n[Heart Disease > Pay Attention to Angina]\nIf too little blood reaches the heart because of narrowed arteries, chest pain (called angina) can develop. Angina can feel like erratic pain or heaviness, tightness, burning, or squeezing in the chest. The pain can be mild and intermittent or more pronounced and steady, and can start in the center of the chest and radiate to the left shoulder, arm, jaw, or lower teeth. Angina often occurs during physical exertion or times of stress. Angina is a sign that you have heart disease and are at risk of having a heart attack.\n\nIf you think you could have angina, tell your doctor right away. Getting prompt treatment for angina can prevent you from having a heart attack. The most common treatment for angina is a drug called nitroglycerin, which reduces the pain by widening the blood vessels to allow more blood to reach the heart.\n\n[Cancer]\nCancer is the second leading cause of death in the US (after heart disease), causing more than half a million deaths each year. One out of two men and one out of three women develop some kind of cancer at some time in their life. Most cancers are diagnosed in people over age 55. Early detection and treatment increase your chances for a cure, so be sure to perform routine self-examinations (see page 137), have all the recommended screening tests (see page 143), and report any suspicious symptoms to your doctor.\n\n[Cancer > What Is Cancer?]\nCancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled multiplication of cells that occurs when genes that control cell division or cell turnover (cell death and replacement) undergo mutations (changes). These genetic mutations are sometimes inherited or present at birth, but usually they result from environmental factors (such as radiation or cigarette smoke) that damage critical regulatory genes.\n\nCell turnover is a tightly balanced process that keeps the body healthy. In normal tissue, old or damaged cells die naturally before they can become cancerous or cause other problems, and are replaced by healthy new cells—a process called apoptosis. In cancer this balance is upset—when damage occurs to either the genes that tell cells when to stop dividing or to the genes that tell old or damaged cells when to die. The resulting increase in the number of cells creates a growing mass of tissue called a tumor. As more and more dividing cells accumulate, the tumor grows and can disrupt the normal functioning of surrounding tissue.\n\nCancer can originate anywhere in the body. Common sites include the lungs, breasts, lymph nodes, colon, bladder, and prostate gland. Cancer can spread through the body in two ways: Cancer cells from a tumor can invade neighboring tissues, and cancer cells from a tumor can penetrate blood vessels or lymphatic vessels, circulate through the bloodstream or lymphatic system, and invade healthy tissue in another part of the body.\n\n[Cancer > What Is Cancer? > What causes cancer?]\nSome people inherit genes that make them susceptible to developing particular types of cancer. Environmental factors that can trigger the changes in genes that lead to cancer\n\ninclude radiation, some chemicals, and some viruses and bacteria. For example, excessive exposure to radiation from sunlight has been linked to skin cancer. More than 60 different chemicals in cigarette smoke are known to cause cancer. The human papillomavirus, which causes the sexually transmitted disease genital warts, is responsible for most cases of cervical cancer in women, and the bacterium *H. pylori* causes many cases of stomach cancer.\n\n![Diagram illustrating factors contributing to cancer risk.

It's common to forget where you put your keys—at any age. You don't need to worry about having a memory problem unless you forget what the keys are for. Practicing memory exercises such as the following can help you keep your memory sharp as you age:\n\n- Memorize some poetry.\n- Look at a photograph; then look away. Write down all the items in the photo that you remember—for example, how many people, animals, buildings, and other objects—and see how well you did.\n- Pick up a paper clip, spool of thread, or other common object. Try to figure out a new use for the object.\n- Draw a floor plan of your childhood home, complete with doors, windows, and furniture placement. Tell a story about an event that occurred there.\n\n[Stress > Preventing Alzheimer's Disease]\nThe following factors seem to have a protective effect against Alzheimer's disease:\n\n- **Education** People who attain a higher level of education tend to have a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease than the general population.\n\n- **Mental activity** Stimulating your mind may protect your brain from Alzheimer's disease by giving you extra connections between cells.\n- **Physical exercise** Exercise enlarges blood vessels, supplying more oxygen-rich blood to the brain.\n- **Vitamin E** Eating foods rich in vitamin E—such as nuts, vegetable oils, whole grains, and green leafy vegetables—or taking vitamin E supplements may protect against Alzheimer's by reducing the cell-damaging effects of molecules in the brain called free radicals.\n- **Folic acid** Consuming adequate amounts of this B vitamin may help prevent Alzheimer's disease by reducing the level in the brain of an amino acid called homocysteine. Elevated levels of homocysteine can damage cells in the area of the brain involved with learning and memory.\n- **Anti-inflammatory drugs** Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications (such as aspirin and ibuprofen) help reduce inflammation in the brain. Inflammation can damage brain cells.\n- **Cholesterol-lowering medications** People who take cholesterol-lowering medications called statins seem to be at significantly lower risk of Alzheimer's disease than other people. The precise effect that elevated cholesterol has on the brain is unknown.\n\n[Stress > Preventing Alzheimer's Disease > *Staying fit as you age*]\nExercise is the best way to stop or reverse age-related loss of muscle, which can make even simple daily activities such as climbing stairs and getting up from a chair hard to do. Strength-building exercises using handheld weights, elastic exercise bands, or weight machines can help you maintain your independence and lower your risk of falls, even into your 90s. Go for frequent walks; walking regularly can significantly lower your risk of having a heart attack or stroke. At least four times a week, do the following exercises at home (for example, while you watch TV). If you're over 50, talk to your doctor before starting an exercise program.\n\n[Stress > Preventing Alzheimer's Disease > *Staying fit as you age* > **Head turn/Neck stretch**]\nSit with your back straight, feet flat on the floor, and head in an upright position.

Treatment is more likely to be successful if it is done before cancer cells spread from the original tumor to other parts of the body. Cancer is most often treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy, or a combination of all three. Immunotherapy and stem cell transplants are being used increasingly to treat cancer.\n\n[Cancer > Cancer Treatments > *Surgery*]\nConventional surgery is usually the first treatment recommended by doctors to remove a cancerous tumor and any surrounding tissue that may contain cancer cells. Less invasive surgical procedures are continually being developed that try to preserve as much healthy tissue and normal functioning as possible.\n\n[Cancer > Cancer Treatments > *Surgery* > **Laser surgery**]\nA laser is a highly focused, powerful beam of light that can cut through tissue or vaporize cancers inside the body or on the skin without the need for a large incision. Laser surgery is also sometimes used to relieve symptoms such as breathing or eating problems that can result when large tumors press on the trachea (windpipe) or esophagus.\n\n[Cancer > Cancer Treatments > *Surgery* > **Cryosurgery**]\nCryosurgery uses extreme cold (liquid nitrogen spray or a very cold probe) to freeze and destroy abnormal cells. Cryosurgery is most often used to treat external cancers, such as those on the skin, or precancerous conditions, such as those affecting the cervix. However, doctors are using it increasingly to treat tumors inside the body, including tumors in the prostate gland.\n\n[Cancer > Cancer Treatments > *Surgery* > **Electrosurgery**]\nHigh-frequency electric current is often used to destroy cancers of the skin and mouth. A procedure called LEEP/LLETZ (loop electrosurgical excision procedure or large-loop excision of the transformation zone) is used to remove abnormal tissue from the cervix.\n\n[Cancer > Cancer Treatments > **Mohs surgery**]\nMohs surgery is a technique to remove cancerous tissue by shaving it off one layer at a time. After each layer is removed, it is examined under a microscope to look for cancer cells. When all the cells in a layer look normal under the microscope, surgery is stopped. This technique is used primarily for skin cancers that have recurred or that have developed around sensitive areas such as the eyelids, nose, or lips. Mohs surgery preserves as much healthy tissue as possible and has a high cure rate.\n\n[Cancer > Cancer Treatments > **Experimental forms of cancer surgery**]\nResearchers are investigating other procedures for removing or destroying cancerous tissue using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), microwaves or radio waves, and magnets.\n\n[Cancer > Cancer Treatments > *Immunotherapy*]\nImmunotherapy uses the immune system to fight cancer, either by stimulating a person's immune system (active immunotherapy) or by administering disease-fighting immune system components (such as antibodies) manufactured outside of the body (passive immunotherapy). These techniques, which include cancer vaccines, are currently being studied for treatment of different types of cancer, including melanoma, kidney cancer, blood cancers (such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myelomas), breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, cervical cancer, and ovarian cancer.\n\n[Cancer > Cancer Treatments > *Stem cell transplants and bone marrow transplants*]\nBone marrow is spongy tissue in the center of bones that makes all the blood cells in the body. Blood cells develop from immature cells called stem cells, which are found in the bone marrow and, in smaller amounts, circulating in the blood. If a cancer destroys bone marrow or if bone marrow is damaged from cancer treatment, doctors may\n\nrecommend a stem cell transplant or bone marrow transplant (see page 624) to provide healthy new cells. Stem cell transplants are also used to treat cancers that don't respond to normal doses of chemotherapy. After a person receives high doses of chemotherapy, he or she is given an infusion of stem cells to replace those that were destroyed.\n\n[Cancer > Cancer Treatments > *Radiation therapy*]\nRadiation therapy uses penetrating beams of high-energy radioactive waves or streams of radioactive particles to treat cancer. This radioactive energy, which is the same as that used in X-rays but in much higher doses, kills the cancer cells or keeps them from dividing. Healthy cells are also affected by radiation but, unlike cancer cells, healthy cells tend to recover from the effects of radiation.\n\nMore than half of all people with cancer are treated with some form of radiation. Radiation is often used before surgery to shrink a tumor or after surgery to block the growth of any cancer cells that could remain in the area around the tumor. Radiation therapy is also often combined with chemotherapy (see below).\n\nRadiation therapy can be given either externally or ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "cancer", "relation": "treated by", "tail": "surgery"}, {"head": "cancer", "relation": "treated by", "tail": "radiation therapy"}, {"head": "cancer", "relation": "treated by", "tail": "chemotherapy"}, {"head": "cancer", "relation": "treated by", "tail": "immunotherapy"}, {"head": "cancer", "relation": "treated by", "tail": "stem cell transplants"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctors", "relation": "recommend", "tail": "[Event: conventional surgery]"}, {"head": "patients", "relation": "undergo", "tail": "[Event: surgery]"}, {"head": "cancer cells", "relation": "spread", "tail": "[Event: cancer spreads to other parts of the body]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: cancer spreads to other parts of the body]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment is less likely to be successful]"}, {"head": "[Event: conventional surgery]", "relation": "results in", "tail": "[Event: removal of a cancerous tumor and surrounding tissue]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Regular exercise lessens pain, improves mobility, strengthens surrounding muscle, and increases flexibility. Exercise also improves your overall fitness and helps control your weight, relieving some of the pressure on overtaxed joints.\n\nTo avoid injury, it's important to begin your exercise program slowly. Start with stretching exercises that increase your range of motion and enhance flexibility (see page 8). Then perform strength-conditioning exercises (see page 9).\n\nYou don't have to go to a gym to lift weights—buy some handheld weights to use at home. Add walking, swimming, or bicycling to your routine. Gradually building up your endurance will enable you to exercise longer, and soon you will be stronger and more active and in less pain.\n\nWater exercise is a good choice for people with osteoarthritis because the water supports the body, reducing stress on the hips, knees, and spine. Another good choice is yoga (see page 94), which gently increases joint flexibility as it tones and strengthens\n\nthe surrounding muscles. Other types of exercise that can benefit people with osteoarthritis include t'ai chi and even jogging. Ask your doctor what exercises are best for you.\n\n[Stress > Exercise and Osteoarthritis > Where does osteoarthritis develop most often?]\nOsteoarthritis occurs most often in the joints of the fingers, at the base of the thumbs, and in the neck, lower back, knees, and hips.\n\n![Diagram showing a human figure from the back, illustrating the common sites of osteoarthritis development: the base of the fingers, the base of the thumbs, the neck, the lower back, the knees, and the hips.]()![](_page_71_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n[Stress > Exercise and Osteoarthritis > The Warning Signs of Osteoarthritis]\n- Steady or intermittent joint pain\n- Joint stiffness after getting out of bed or sitting for a long time\n- Swelling in a joint\n- A crunching sound when bone rubs on bone\n\nHot, red, or tender joints are usually a sign of another form of arthritis, called rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n[Stress > Exercise and Osteoarthritis > Exercise is good for your joints]\nRegular physical exercise such as walking is good for people with arthritis. It keeps the joints working as it strengthens the surrounding muscles and ligaments. Exercise can also reduce joint pain, although it can take 4 to 8 weeks of regular exercise before you experience significant pain relief.\n\n![A woman wearing a white sweatshirt and shorts, walking outdoors on a paved path surrounded by grass and trees.]()![](_page_72_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n[Heart Disease]\nYour heart beats steadily 24 hours a day to pump oxygen-rich blood throughout your body. But if the arteries leading to your heart become clogged with a fatty substance called plaque, they become narrowed, reducing the supply of blood to the heart and causing heart disease. If a plaque ruptures, blood clots can form, blocking the artery and causing a heart attack. Heart disease is the No. 1 killer of both men and women in the US, but many women do not realize they are at risk. The good news is that you can reduce your chances of developing heart disease by adopting the heart-healthy lifestyle described here.\n\n[Heart Disease > Risk Factors for Heart Disease]\nSome of the factors that can increase your chances of developing heart disease, such as family history, are not under your control. Many other risk factors, however, can be controlled.\n\n[Heart Disease > Risk Factors for Heart Disease > *Risk factors you cannot control*]\n- **Age** In men, the risk of heart disease increases after age 45; in women, the risk increases after age 55.\n- **Family history** Especially at a young age—a father or brother diagnosed with heart disease before age 55, or a mother or sister diagnosed before age 65.\n- **Race** African Americans have a higher risk of heart disease than people of other races.\n\n[Heart Disease > Risk Factors for Heart Disease > *Risk factors you can control*]\n- **Smoking** Smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease because it raises blood pressure, damages blood vessels, promotes blood clotting, and accelerates plaque formation in artery walls.\n- **High blood pressure** High blood pressure (hypertension) puts extra stress on the heart and blood vessels.\n\n- **Undesirable cholesterol profile** A high total cholesterol level, a low HDL (good) cholesterol level, or a high LDL (bad) cholesterol level can promote plaque formation on artery walls.\n- **Being overweight** Excess weight increases the heart's workload.\n- **Lack of exercise** Regular exercise makes the heart stronger, keeps weight down, improves cholesterol levels, and lowers blood pressure.\n- **Diabetes** Over time, diabetes damages blood vessels and boosts the risk of heart attack and stroke.\n- **Stres", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "exercise", "relation": "treats", "tail": "osteoarthritis"}, {"head": "exercise", "relation": "lessens", "tail": "pain"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "patient", "relation": "participates in", "tail": "[Event: exercise program]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "performs", "tail": "[Event: strength-conditioning exercises]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: injury]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: treatment]"}]}, "status": "success"}

When you experience stress, your body makes two hormones, cortisol and adrenaline, that help you deal with the tense situation. Over the long term, however, too much of these hormones produced for too long can cause anxiety and physical symptoms that can trigger or worsen illnesses such as high blood pressure, asthma, or heart disease. Persistent, prolonged stress can also adversely affect your immune system, making you more susceptible to infections and other illnesses.\n\nA number of natural ways to reduce stress—such as deep breathing, yoga, meditation, biofeedback, exercise, and massage—have been proven to be effective. Try all of them until you find what works best for you. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (see page 710) provided by a mental health professional can also be helpful. If you feel overwhelmed by the stress in your life, talk with your doctor about effective stress-reduction methods (see page 58).\n\n[Stress > It's Not All in Your Mind]\nStress can affect your body in a number of ways. Chronic, long-term stress can be especially harmful. Learning how to manage your response to stress can help you avoid these damaging effects.\n\n[Stress > It's Not All in Your Mind > Hair]\nSome forms of baldness, such as alopecia areata, have been linked to stress.\n\n[Stress > It's Not All in Your Mind > Brain]\nStress can trigger headaches and behavioral and emotional problems such as anxiety and depression. A persistent release of the stress hormone cortisol can kill brain cells directly, causing memory and learning problems.\n\n[Stress > It's Not All in Your Mind > Heart]\nHeaviness or pain in the chest (angina), rapid heartbeat, and abnormal heart rhythms can occur during or shortly after periods of stress.\n\n[Stress > Digestive tract]\nStress can cause or worsen disorders or diseases of the digestive tract such as indigestion, peptic ulcers, and irritable bowel syndrome. Severe stress can slow digestion.\n\n[Stress > Abdominal fat]\nProlonged or severe stress can cause fat to be deposited at the waist rather than on the hips and buttocks, increasing the risk of heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and other illnesses.\n\n[Stress > Bones]\nHigh levels of the stress hormone cortisol can cause bone loss.\n\n[Stress > Skin]\nSome people have outbreaks of skin problems such as eczema and psoriasis when they are under stress. Stress also can increase perspiration.\n\n[Stress > Mouth]\nTeeth grinding, mouth ulcers, and dry mouth seem to occur more often during times of stress.\n\n[Stress > Lungs]\nPeople with asthma often find that their condition worsens when they are under stress. Stress can also speed up breathing.\n\n[Stress > Bladder]\nStress can trigger an urgent need to urinate.\n\n[Stress > Reproductive organs]\nSevere stress can suppress the reproductive system, causing absence of periods in women and erection problems and premature ejaculation in men.\n\n[Stress > Muscles]\nMinor muscular tics become more noticeable, especially on the face and hands, and muscles often become tense when a person is under stress.\n\n[Stress > Immune system]\nWhen a person is under stress, the immune system can become weakened, increasing the risk of infections and other illnesses.\n\n![A man sitting in an office chair, looking stressed, with his head resting on his hand, illustrating the effects of stress on the body.]()![](_page_58_Picture_6.jpeg)\n\n[Stress > Don't Cheat on Sleep]\nWhen it comes to stress, sleep is like medicine, but sometimes you can get caught in a vicious circle. You can't sleep because you feel stressed, and the lack of sleep causes more stress, which affects your sleep. Lacking sufficient sleep for a long period can have harmful effects on your mind and body. Lack of sleep can increase your risk of type 2 diabetes, lower your resistance to illness, and raise your blood pressure—all important reasons to take sleep more seriously.\n\nIf you're going through a high-stress period, one way to make sure you get a good night's sleep is to shift your focus away from your daytime worries. When you go to bed at night, try to keep yourself from brooding over your daily problems and concerns. Things always seem worse in the middle of the night. Try to look at sleep as an escape from the stresses of the day, not a time for replaying them in your mind.\n\nA midafternoon nap is another way to make up for insufficient sleep at night. Even a short, 20-minute nap will refresh you and improve your mental performance. Just make sure you finish your nap before 3 in the afternoon; napping later can make it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.\n\nTry the tips on pages 57 and 58; they can help you improve your sleep. If you experience sleeplessness for longer than 6 weeks and these suggestions don't seem to help, talk to your doctor. He or she may refer you to a sleep center for treatment.\n\n![A woman lying in bed, resting her head on her hand, appearing to be ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "cortisol", "relation": "produced by", "tail": "body"}, {"head": "adrenaline", "relation": "produced by", "tail": "body"}, {"head": "high blood pressure", "relation": "triggered or worsened by", "tail": "stress"}, {"head": "asthma", "relation": "triggered or worsened by", "tail": "stress"}, {"head": "heart disease", "relation": "triggered or worsened by", "tail": "stress"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "body", "relation": "makes", "tail": "[Event: hormones for stress]"}, {"head": "immune system", "relation": "adversely affected by", "tail": "[Event: prolonged stress]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "participates in", "tail": "[Event: try all methods to reduce stress]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: prolonged stress]", "relation": "adversely affects", "tail": "[Event: immune system]"}, {"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "can be caused by", "tail": "[Event: weakened immune system]"}]}, "status": "success"}

The articles in these chapters have an easy-to-follow, straightforward format that usually includes the following headings: Symptoms (describes the most common symptoms and signs of the disorder), Diagnosis (explains how the disorder is diagnosed), Treatment (explores the treatment options for the disorder), and Prevention (tells how the disorder can be prevented, when prevention is possible).\n\nWithin the articles on specific diseases, you will also find cross-references to other parts of the book. Use these cross-references, along with the index, to add to your knowledge of or improve your understanding about a particular health problem or concern.\n\n[AMA_Family_Guide > Glossaries]\nThis section contains a general Glossary and a Drug Glossary. The general Glossary defines some common medical terms you might hear or read. The Drug Glossary has two sections—a section on drug classes (the groups into which drugs are categorized) and a section on the top 200 prescription drugs.\n\n[PART ONE > Healthy Eating]\nA wealth of information exists about the fundamental link between diet and health. Although many people think that healthy eating means flavorless, unsatisfying meals, this does not have to be the case. A healthy diet includes plenty of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, and other high-fiber, high-nutrient foods; supplies the right number of calories; and limits saturated fat and trans fats (such as those found in stick margarine), salt, sugar, and alcohol. The components of a healthy diet translate easily into delicious meals that can appeal to the whole family. For more about a nutritious diet, see pages 35 to 44.\n\n[PART ONE > Healthy Eating > Eat Five a Day for Better Health]\nWe have all heard from experts that eating at least five fruits and vegetables each day is one of the most important things we can do for our health, but only one out of four of us is actually eating this amount. Fruits and vegetables provide a wide assortment of vitamins and minerals, including the antioxidant vitamins—vitamin C, the carotenoids (beta carotene, lycopene, and lutein), and vitamin E—which fight cell damage from free radicals, a major cause of aging and most chronic diseases. Fruits and vegetables also provide fiber, an essential nutrient that promotes healthy bowel function and helps lower the risk of heart disease and some types of cancer. Fruits and vegetables are so good-tasting and so good for you that you should try to consume as many as you can. Five servings a day is the minimum for keeping you healthy (10 a day is better). Here are some tips to help you get your daily dose of fruits and veggies:\n\n- Have one or two servings of fruit at breakfast every day.\n- Choose a fruit or vegetable for a snack.\n- Have a salad at lunch.\n- Stock up on dried, canned, and frozen fruits and vegetables.\n- Serve more than one vegetable for dinner.\n\n[PART ONE > Healthy Eating > *Eat your colors*]\nFruits and vegetables come in an array of colors, and the color of a food usually says something about its nutritional value.

The smoke from a cigarette contains more than 4,000 chemicals—at least 60 of them known to cause cancer. Nicotine, the substance in tobacco that makes smoking highly addictive, raises your heart rate, irritates the lining of your blood vessels, and promotes blood clotting, increasing your risk of heart attack and stroke. The carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke reduces the level of oxygen in your blood.\n\nSmoking causes nearly nine out of ten cases of lung cancer—the No. 1 cancer killer of both men and women—and causes other cancers, including cancer of the mouth, throat, esophagus, bladder, kidneys, cervix, and pancreas. Smoking is also responsible for most cases of emphysema and chronic bronchitis and is a major risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death in both men and women. Women over age 35 who both smoke and take birth-control pills increase their risk of having a heart attack or stroke.\n\n[Genetics > The Dangers of Smoking > Why You're Hooked]\nResearchers have discovered why smokers have such a hard time quitting. Normally, your brain releases dopamine (a chemical that produces feelings of pleasure) when you perform a rewarding behavior, such as eating when you are hungry. The brain then quickly releases another chemical, called acetylcholine, which stops the release of dopamine.\n\nWhen you smoke, nicotine triggers the release of dopamine but prevents the brain from turning it off by blocking the release of acetylcholine. As a result, the brain continues pumping out dopamine, making you feel better and better. After nicotine levels in the bloodstream fall, dopamine production declines. The brain, recalling the good feelings, wants more, producing cravings for another cigarette. These processes take place inside a part of your brain that scientists call the reward center.\n\n[Genetics > The Dangers of Smoking > Why You're Hooked > The brain's reward center]\nTwo structures—the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area—deep in the brain's reward center are responsible for the release of dopamine, which produces feelings of pleasure.\n\n![Diagram of the brain showing the Nucleus accumbens and Ventral tegmental area, located deep in the brain's reward center.]()![](_page_95_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n[Genetics > The Dangers of Smoking > When the brain's reward center works normally]\n- **ON:** The reward center releases dopamine to reward a good behavior, such as learning a new skill (green arrows).\n- **OFF:** Minutes later, another brain chemical, acetylcholine, shuts dopamine production off (red arrows).\n\n![Diagram illustrating the reward center releasing dopamine (green arrows) and acetylcholine (red arrows) shutting off dopamine production.]()![](_page_95_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\n[Genetics > The Dangers of Smoking > When nicotine interferes with the reward center]\n- **ON:** Nicotine in the bloodstream causes the reward center to release a flood of dopamine (green arrows).\n- **NOT OFF:** Nicotine blocks the release of acetylcholine, so the\n\nreward center keeps releasing dopamine until blood levels of nicotine fall, producing craving for more nicotine (red arrows).\n\n![Diagram illustrating the reward center mechanism.

Nearly two out of three adults and about 15 percent of children in the US are overweight. Most alarming, overweight children and adolescents are developing common chronic illnesses—such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes—that used to affect only adults.\n\nBody weight results from the complex interaction of inherited, physical, behavioral, socioeconomic, and cultural factors. The major factors contributing to overweight are basic—eating too much and exercising too little. And many Americans tend to eat the wrong kinds of foods: foods that are highly refined, high in salt, and often high in saturated and trans fats and calories and low in fiber.\n\n[PART ONE > Are You at a Healthy Weight? > Health Risks of Being Overweight]\nBeing overweight increases your risk of a number of chronic health problems, including heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and some cancers. The way in which fat is distributed on your body can also increase your health risks. You are at greater risk of health problems if you tend to accumulate fat around your abdomen than if you tend to accumulate fat around your hips and thighs. The risks increase further if your waist is 35 inches or larger (if you're a woman) or 40 inches or larger (if you're a man). To determine if you are overweight, check the BMI chart on the next page. To determine if your child is overweight, have him or her evaluated by the doctor. Your doctor can work with you to develop an effective weight-loss plan.\n\n[PART ONE > Are You at a Healthy", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "abdominal muscles", "relation": "uses", "tail": "keep back straight"}, {"head": "back", "relation": "keeps", "tail": "straight"}, {"head": "hands", "relation": "aligns", "tail": "shoulders"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "you", "relation": "shift", "tail": "[Event: weight forward]"}, {"head": "you", "relation": "lower", "tail": "[Event: body from knees up]"}, {"head": "you", "relation": "push", "tail": "[Event: arms almost straight]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: weight forward]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: lower body from knees up]"}, {"head": "[Event: lower body from knees up]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: push arms almost straight]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Vitamins are divided into two categories—fat-soluble and water-soluble. Fat-soluble vitamins are found in fats and oils in foods and are stored in body fat. Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water and mix easily in the blood. Your body stores only small amounts of water-soluble vitamins (the excess is eliminated in urine). Some vitamins are antioxidants, which protect against damage to cells by free radicals (molecules formed by normal cell processes). Antioxidants can help protect against disease and aging. The best way to get the vitamins and minerals your body needs is to eat a varied diet rich in low-fat, high-fiber vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains; fish; and low-fat dairy products, poultry, and meats.\n\n| Vitamin or mineral                      | Good sources                                                                                     | Health benefits                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                       |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| <strong>FAT-SOLUBLE VITAMINS</strong>   |                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Vitamin A                               | <img alt=\"A bottle of milk labeled MILK\"/>                                                       | Fortified milk, eggs, cheese, butter, liver, cod and halibut, fish oil                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Antioxidant; essential for growth and development; maintains healthy vision, skin, and mucous membranes.                                              |\n| Vitamin D                               |                                                                                                  | Salmon, mackerel, fortified milk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Builds bones and teeth; helps the body absorb and use calcium.                                                                                        |\n| Vitamin E                               | <img alt=\"A dark green leafy vegetable, likely kale\"/>                                           | Vegetable oils, whole grains, wheat germ, nuts, green leafy vegetables                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Antioxidant; anti-inflammatory; helps form blood cells, muscles, and lung and nerve tissue; boosts the immune system; may help prevent heart disease. |\n| Vitamin K                               | Dark green leafy vegetables, liver, egg yolks                                                    | Essential for blood clotting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Beta carotene   ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Vitamins", "relation": "are", "tail": "divided"}, {"head": "Fat-soluble vitamins", "relation": "are", "tail": "found"}, {"head": "Water-soluble vitamins", "relation": "dissolve", "tail": "in water"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "Your body", "relation": "stores", "tail": "[Event: small amounts of water-soluble vitamins]"}, {"head": "Free radicals", "relation": "are formed by", "tail": "[Event: normal cell processes]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: damage to cells]", "relation": "is protected against", "tail": "[Event: by antioxidants]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Although each of your cells contains exactly the same genes, cells differ from each other because different combinations of genes are switched on and off in each cell. These different gene combinations determine what proteins each cell makes and enable the cell to perform a specialized task.\n\n[Genetics > Chromosomes]\nInside the nucleus of every cell are structures called chromosomes. Chromosomes are long threads of genetic material made up of strands of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). You have 23 pairs of chromosomes; each of your parents contributed one chromosome to every pair. Each chromosome contains from several hundred to several thousand genes. Just before cells divide, the chromosomes make duplicate copies of themselves;\n\nthe two copies of each chromosome are held together at a narrowed region called a centromere, which gives the chromosome an X shape.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the structure of a chromosome. A magnified view shows a cell containing multiple chromosomes. A single chromosome is shown in detail, labeled 'Centromere' and 'Chromosome', highlighting its X shape. A magnified view of the chromosome shows the centromere as a narrow region where the two sister chromatids are held together.]()![](_page_88_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n[Genetics > Genes]\nGenes are the basic physical and functional units of heredity, which provide instructions for making proteins, the building blocks of the body. Scientists believe that genes make up only about 2 percent of the total genome; the rest consists of regions whose functions include keeping the chromosomes intact and regulating where, when, and in what quantity proteins are made.\n\n![Diagram of a DNA double helix structure. The two intertwined strands are labeled 'Nucleotide bases'. A segment of the helix is highlighted and labeled 'Gene'. A segment of three nucleotides (a base triplet) is shown, labeled 'Base triplet'.]()![](_page_89_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[Genetics > The genetic code]\nThe information carried by a gene is determined by the structure of its DNA. DNA is arranged in the form of a double helix, or ladder, with rungs supported by a twisting ribbon of sugar and phosphates. The two intertwined DNA strands are linked together by varying patterns of substances called nucleotide bases. There are four nucleotide bases—cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A), and thymine (T).\n\nAlong each helix, or side of the ladder, the bases are arranged in groups of three, called base triplets, to form words of genetic text. For example, base triplets, such as TAC, CGG, and TCA, carry specific amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) to assembly points in a cell where they are strung together to make functioning proteins. To form the rungs of the DNA ladder, the bases can join in only two ways: C joins only with G, and A joins only with T.\n\nIf you think of the nucleotide bases as the letters of the genetic alphabet, then base triplets are the words, genes are the sentences, chromosomes are the chapters, and the genome is each organism's book of life. The human genome contains a total of about 3 billion nucleotide base pairs.\n\n[Genetics > Proteins: Building Blocks of the Body]\nProteins are essential for life. Some proteins make up structures such as muscles and skin; other proteins—including enzymes, antibodies, and many hormones—dissolve in the body's fluids and are carried to wherever they\n\nare needed. Genes control the production of proteins inside cells and provide the instructions for making specific proteins in precisely the right number and at precisely the right time. Different proteins have different functions in the body:\n\n- Enzymes regulate the rate of chemical reactions in cells.\n- Antibodies, produced by the immune system's white blood cells, destroy invading microorganisms and provide protection against infections.\n- Proteins in muscle cells provide mobility, pump blood through the body, and help move food through the digestive tract.\n- Hemoglobin carries oxygen in red blood cells and gives the cells their red color.\n- Hormones control a variety of biological processes, such as growth, sexual development, and the activities of some organs.\n\n![A 3D rendering of a complex protein structure, likely a ribosome or a large molecule, composed of intertwined blue, orange, and green lines against a black background.]()![](_page_90_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\n[Genetics > Proteins: Building Blocks of the Body > *Genetics: The future of medicine*]\nYou will one day be able to learn from your unique genome what disorders you are at increased risk of developing, which will enable you to take steps to prevent them.

These guidelines show you how to get the nutrients you need to lead a healthier, more active life and to lower your risk for the most common chronic diseases, including heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure, and diabetes. To maintain optimum health:\n\n- Aim for a healthy weight.\n- Be physically active every day.\n- Eat a variety of grains daily, especially whole grains.\n- Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables daily.\n- Store food properly.\n- Eat a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol and moderate in total fat.\n- Choose beverages and foods that are low in sugar.\n- Choose and prepare foods with less salt.\n- If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation.\n\n[Terrorism > USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans > *Carbohydrates*]\nCarbohydrates are the main source of fuel for your body and should make up 45 to 65 percent of your daily calorie intake. Carbohydrates contribute sugar, starches, and fiber from plant foods and come in two forms—simple and complex. Your body absorbs simple carbohydrates—such as those in table sugar, most fruits, and the sugar in milk (lactose)—very quickly. Complex carbohydrates are absorbed more gradually and provide your body with a more constant supply of energy. Complex carbohydrates also help stabilize blood glucose levels, avoiding the up-and-down swings in glucose that can result from eating simple carbohydrates. For these reasons, most of the carbohydrates you eat should be complex carbohydrates from whole grains, vegetables, and whole fruits (including the skins).\n\nChildren and adults should consume about 130 grams of carbohydrates every day, which is the minimum amount necessary to get a sufficient amount of glucose to enable the brain to function properly. Most people get much more than this. Sources of added sugars are everywhere in the American food supply and in all food groups. Some\n\nobvious sources are candy, soft drinks, fruit drinks, pastries, and other sweets. Some not-so-obvious sources are salad dressings, cereals, ketchup, and breads. People who eat too many added sugars often take in too many calories and fewer of the essential nutrients than they need. Try to limit your intake of foods and beverages that have added sugars.\n\n[Terrorism > USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans > *Fiber*]\nFiber, a substance in the cell walls of plants, is an especially important component of complex carbohydrates because it helps lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and reduces your risk of heart disease. Fiber can help you maintain a healthy weight. It also may help lower your risk of colon cancer and other digestive tract disorders such as diverticulosis (see page 772). Dietary fiber occurs in two forms—soluble and insoluble. Neither type is digestible, but they both serve important functions in your diet. Soluble fiber—found naturally in oats, barley, dried beans and peas (legumes), and some fruits—is the type that improves cholesterol. A grass called psyllium, which is added to some cereals and breads and is used in some over-the-counter stool softeners and laxatives, has also been shown to help lower blood cholesterol. Insoluble fiber—contained in whole-wheat bread, wheat bran, and fruit and vegetable skins—provides bulk to stool, helping it pass more easily through the digestive system. For this reason, insoluble fiber, along with plenty of fluid, helps prevent constipation.\n\n[Terrorism > USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans > *Fiber* > Good Sources of Fiber]\n| Food                | Serving Size | Total Fiber (Grams) |\n|---------------------|--------------|---------------------|\n| Legumes (Cooked)    |              |                     |\n| Pinto beans         | 1 cup        | 15                  |\n| Navy beans          | 1 cup        | 13                  |\n| Kidney beans        | 1 cup        | 11                  |\n| Chickpeas           | 1 cup        | 9                   |\n| Vegetables (Cooked) |              |                     |\n\n| Artichoke                  | 1 medium     | 7   |\n|----------------------------|--------------|-----|\n| Green peas                 | 1 cup        | 6   |\n| Sweet potato               | 1 medium     | 4   |\n| Corn                       | 1 medium ear | 2.5 |\n| Fruits                     |              |     |\n| Raspberries                | 1 cup        | 8   |\n| Blueberries                | 1 cup        | 6   |\n| Apple with skin            | 1 medium     | 4   |\n| Orange                     | 1 medium     | 3   |\n| Whole Grains               |              |     |\n| Packaged wheat-bran cereal | 1 cup        | 8   |\n| Whole-grain bread          | 2 slices     | 4   |\n| Oatmeal (cooked)           | 1 cup        | 4   |\n| Whole-wheat pasta (cooked) | 1 cup        | 4   |\n\nThe recommended dai", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "saturated fat", "relation": "low in", "tail": "diet"}, {"head": "cholesterol", "relation": "low in", "tail": "diet"}, {"head": "total fat", "relation": "moderate in", "tail": "diet"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "patient", "relation": "participate in", "tail": "[Event: clinical trial]"}, {"head": "you", "relation": "get the nutrients you need to lead a healthier, more active life and to lower your risk for the most common chronic diseases", "tail": "[Event: following dietary guidelines]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

(Infants and young children need a larger proportion of fat—25 to 40 percent of total daily calories.) Also, choose your fats wisely. As few of your calories as possible (less than 5 to 10 percent of total calories) should come from saturated fat and trans fats. Trans fats are found in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, which are used in many margarines and shortenings to make liquid oils hard at room temperature. Trans fats may be even more harmful to the heart than saturated fats.\n\nTrans fats are often used in packaged baked goods such as cakes, cookies, crackers, and pie crusts; in snacks such as potato chips; and in some dairy products, meats, restaurant fried foods, and fast foods. Consume as little of these fats as possible. Read food labels to find the amounts of trans fats in foods. Take the following steps to limit your consumption of these harmful fats:\n\n- When buying processed foods, read the ingredient list and avoid those that list trans fats or hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils. Look for foods that contain unhydrogenated oils.\n\n- Use naturally occurring unhydrogenated oils such as canola or olive oil.\n- Choose the soft or liquid margarines sold in tubs or squeeze bottles instead of stick margarines or butter. Look for soft margarines with vegetable oil listed as the first ingredient and that contain no more than 2 grams of saturated fat per tablespoon. Tub margarines that contain plant substances called sterols or phytosterols or stanols have highly beneficial effects on blood cholesterol levels, primarily by lowering the level of harmful LDL. Eating 1 to 2 tablespoons of these margarines with your food each day can reduce total blood cholesterol by as much as 15 to 20 percent.\n- Avoid fatty fried foods such as French fries and doughnuts, and snacks such as cookies, crackers, and chips.", "response": {"entity_entity": [], "entity_event": [{"head": "Lentils", "relation": "", "tail": "[Event: Comparing Protein Sources]"}, {"head": "Kidney beans (red)", "relation": "", "tail": "[Event: Comparing Protein Sources]"}, {"head": "Tofu, firm", "relation": "", "tail": "[Event: Comparing Protein Sources]"}, {"head": "Chickpeas (canned)", "relation": "", "tail": "[Event: Comparing Protein Sources]"}, {"head": "Peanut butter (smooth)", "relation": "", "tail": "[Event: Comparing Protein Sources]"}, {"head": "Oatmeal, plain", "relation": "", "tail": "[Event: Comparing Protein Sources]"}, {"head": "Cashews", "relation": "", "tail": "[Event: Comparing Protein Sources]"}, {"head": "Peanuts (dry-roasted, unsalted)", "relation": "", "tail": "[Event: Comparing Protein Sources]"}, {"head": "Bread, whole wheat", "relation": "", "tail": "[Event: Comparing Protein Sources]"}, {"head": "Bread, white", "relation": "", "tail": "[Event: Comparing Protein Sources]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

Your blood contains lipo (fat) proteins that influence your risk of heart disease. One lipoprotein, called HDL cholesterol, is good for the heart. Another lipoprotein, called LDL cholesterol, can be harmful to the heart and can increase your risk of heart attack.\n\nBlood cholesterol is a gummy substance your liver makes to help manufacture hormones and bile (a fluid that aids digestion). The liver makes most of the cholesterol from saturated fats that you consume in foods such as meats, baked goods, and full-fat dairy products. A smaller amount of cholesterol is absorbed into the bloodstream directly from cholesterol-containing foods such as egg yolks. The amount of cholesterol in your blood is determined not only by your diet, but also by hereditary factors. Some people inherit a susceptibility to elevated blood cholesterol.\n\n[Terrorism > Dietary Fat > Comparing Types of Fat]\n| Types of Fat         | Major Food Sources                                | Effects on Blood Cholesterol              |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Monounsaturated fats | Olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil, nuts, avocados | Lower LDL (bad) and total cholesterol and |\n\n| Polyunsaturated fats | Corn oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, flaxseed oil, soybean oil, cottonseed oil, fish                                                           | raise HDL (good) cholesterol<br>Lower total cholesterol and can lower HDL (good) cholesterol |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Omega-3 fatty acids  | Fatty, cold-water fish such as salmon, mackerel, and tuna                                                                                         | Lower total cholesterol, lower LDL (bad) cholesterol, and raise HDL (good) cholesterol       |\n| Plant sterols        | Some tub margarines and salad dressings                                                                                                           | Lower total cholesterol and lower LDL (bad) cholesterol                                      |\n| Saturated fats       | Fatty red meat, dark meat of poultry, whole and 2% dairy products, butter, chocolate, coconut oil, palm oil                                       | Increase total cholesterol and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol                                |\n| Trans fats           | Most stick margarines, vegetable shortening, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, deep-fried chips, many fast foods, most commercial baked goods | Increase total cholesterol and LDL (bad) cholesterol and may lower HDL (good) cholesterol    |\n| Dietary cholesterol  | Egg yolks, shrimp, liver, full-fat dairy products                                                                                                 | Raises total cholesterol (but not as much as saturated fats and trans fats do)               |\n\n[Terrorism > *Vitamins and Minerals*]\nVitamins are chemicals in food that your body needs to function normally. Minerals are elements absorbed by plant foods that are essential for your body in very small amounts. With the exception of vitamin D, your body cannot make vitamins or minerals, so you need to get them from the foods you eat. Some people can get sufficient amounts of vitamins and minerals from their diet, but many of us need to take a multivitamin/mineral supplement to ensure that we get all of the essential nutrients. Although food is the best source of nutrients, most doctors now recommend that most people take a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement.\n\nWhile taking a daily multivitamin can be beneficial, it should not take the place of a healthy diet. Foods supply many nutrients—such as fiber, essential fatty acids, and antioxidants and phytochemicals—that are not present in supplements. Avoid taking massive doses of specific vitamins or minerals, which can be harmful and can increase or reduce your body's absorption of other vitamins and minerals. For example, fat-soluble vitamins such as A and D (which are not eliminated in urine, as are the water-soluble vitamins) can cause serious health problems. Unless you are a menstruating woman or you have been diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia (see page 610), take a multivitamin that does not contain iron or that has no more than 15 milligrams of iron. Excess levels of iron are linked to an increased risk of heart disease.\n\n[Terrorism > *Vitamins and Minerals* > **Some Foods That Pack Lots of Nutrients**]\nNutrition experts recommend consuming a varied diet to make sure you meet all of your nutritional needs.

It does not provide energy or calories but, like fiber, it plays a critical role in the body's ability to function normally. Water helps your body distribute nutrients to cells, regulate body temperature, and eliminate waste. Drink six to eight glasses of water each day—more if you consume drinks that contain caffeine or alcohol, both of which increase water loss from the body. Vigorous exercise and hot, humid weather can rapidly use up your body's supply of fluid and increase your need for water, but they are not the only dehydrating factors. Living in a dry climate and dry, indoor heating in the winter can also increase the risk of dehydration and boost your water requirements.\n\nFluoridated water helps prevent tooth decay. Some parts of the United States have water supplies with naturally occurring fluoride; in others, municipalities add the mineral to the water supply. Many people drink bottled water because they think it's safer. However, most bottled waters do not contain fluoride or naturally occurring minerals. Some supplemented bottled waters contain various nutrients, but they can be expensive and may not be as healthy as water from the tap.\n\nThe US government regulates the safety of American drinking water through established standards for water purity. Most public water supplies meet these standards. However, if water treatment systems break down, bacteria and other contaminants can reach unsafe levels. In these situations, local officials usually advise residents to boil their tap water before drinking it or using it for cooking. Lead that leaches from plumbing pipes, solder, or well pumps also can contaminate tap water, especially in older homes. To minimize the level of lead in the tap water in your home, run the cold water for 3 or 4 minutes the first time you use it each day.

Vegetarians are less likely than meat eaters to develop heart disease, high blood pressure, and some cancers, or to be overweight. But vegetarians can risk developing iron deficiency anemia (see page 610) or being malnourished if they are not knowledgeable about appropriate food choices.\n\nThere are three types of vegetarian diets—ovolactovegetarian, lactovegetarian, and vegan. Ovolactovegetarians consume eggs and dairy products along with plant foods. Lactovegetarians eat dairy products but not eggs. Vegans eat only plant foods and, for this reason, are most at risk for vitamin and mineral deficiencies; however, a vegan diet can be very healthy when plant-based foods are combined. A vegetarian diet for children and pregnant women must be planned very carefully to ensure that they consume sufficient calories, calcium, protein, and essential nutrients to meet all their vitamin, mineral, and amino acid (protein) needs.\n\nIf you're not ready to be a full-time vegetarian, at least try eating a few vegetarian meals every week. Occasionally having pasta with a meatless sauce, bean or avocado burritos, or mushroom barley soup for lunch or dinner along with salads and fruits will vary your menu, save money, and provide huge health benefits.\n\n[Terrorism > *Vitamins and Minerals* > *Nutritional Needs Change Throughout Life*]\nTo a large extent, your age determines your nutritional needs. Newborns and infants have special nutritional needs that are best met by breastfeeding (see page 539).\n\nDoctors recommend that mothers breastfeed their babies for the first 12 months of life. Breast milk supplies better nutrition than commercial formula, promotes healthy brain development, and provides infection-fighting antibodies from the mother. Also, infants should not be given cow's milk until they are 1 year old because it can cause an allergic reaction and is too concentrated for an infant's digestive system.\n\n[Terrorism > Food Sensitivities]\nA food sensitivity is a reaction to an additive or ingredient in a food, but the reaction is not related to the immune system. Sulfites, substances that occur naturally in the fermentation of wine and are used as preservatives on fresh fruits and vegetables, are common additives that cause food sensitivity. Sulfites can trigger severe asthmalike symptoms such as shortness of breath and chest tightness. In the United States, foods and wine that contain sulfites must indicate it on their label. Flavor enhancers (such as monosodium glutamate) and food coloring (mainly yellow dye No. 5) can cause adverse reactions such as headaches. Sometimes a naturally occurring substance called histamine can cause a reaction known as histamine toxicity, which mimics an allergic reaction. Cheese, some wines, and tuna and mackerel sometimes contain large amounts of histamine.\n\nDifferent people can have different reactions to the same foods. If you think you could be having problems with a particular food, see your doctor; he or she can help you identify the foods that trigger a reaction so you can avoid them.\n\nToddlers and preschoolers sometimes become picky eaters as their newfound independence propels them into a multitude of activities that seem much more interesting than eating. Start to teach good nutrition habits at this age. Offer your child a variety of foods without forcing him or her to eat any particular food. When deciding how much food to give your child, use this convenient rule of thumb: about 1 tablespoon of each food per meal for every year of age. For example, a typical dinner for a 5-year-old might be 5 tablespoons of chicken along with 5 tablespoons of a vegetable and 5 tablespoons of brown rice.\n\nAs your child enters school, he or she will still need lots of calories to fuel growth. However, the number of children in America who are overweight or obese is skyrocketing. Being overweight as a child can lead to health problems such as heart\n\ndisease and diabetes—and Americans are developing these diseases at younger and younger ages. Limit your child's intake of high-calorie, high-fat snacks, and encourage him or her to be physically active. In general, being physically active is a better solution for an overweight child than a diet that drastically cuts calories because of the risk of developing an eating disorder (see page 725) or of getting insufficient amounts of essential nutrients.\n\nThe accelerated body changes that occur during adolescence are sustained by good nutrition.

Regular exercise provides many health benefits, including a reduced risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, some cancers, and most of the other common chronic diseases that can affect us as we age. The sedentary lifestyle of increasing numbers of Americans is a serious public health problem in this country. Even if you have been sedentary for years, it's never too late to gain health benefits from exercise.\n\n[Terrorism > Exercise, Fitness, and Health > The Health Benefits of Physical Activity]\nThe human body is designed for movement. We inherited the same efficient mechanisms our primitive ancestors needed for hunting food, traveling long distances on foot, and building shelter. Today, however, most of us drive our cars to the grocery store and sit in offices or classrooms for a large part of the day. Our lack of exercise triggers the processes that lead to common chronic diseases, including osteoporosis, heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. Physical activity can help prevent these debilitating chronic diseases and keep you healthy in the following ways:\n\n- Increases the efficiency of your heart and lungs.\n- Raises the level of helpful HDL cholesterol and lowers the level of harmful LDL cholesterol in your blood.\n- Helps you control your weight.\n- Improves sleep.\n- Reduces stress, improves your mood, and lowers your risk of depression.\n- Boosts the strength and tone of your muscles.\n- Builds strong bones.\n- Increases the flexibility of your joints.\n- Improves your self-image.\n- Increases your energy level and endurance.\n- Improves your posture.\n- Slows the aging process.\n\n- Improves your quality of life as you age.\n\nExercise also has beneficial effects on the brain. Physical exercise seems to stimulate the growth of brain cells, especially in an area of the brain called the hippocampus, which plays an important role in memory and learning. Physical activity also may improve the brain's defenses against infection.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine has established exercise guidelines that set a goal of 1 hour a day of activity, including both low-intensity activities of daily life (such as walking or housecleaning) and more vigorous exercise (such as jogging, swimming, or cycling). If your job is sedentary, you can achieve this goal by, for example, walking at a pace of 4 miles per hour for a total of 60 minutes every day, or by engaging in a high-intensity activity such as jogging for 20 to 30 minutes 4 to 7 days a week. These guidelines are recommended for all children over age 6 and for all adults.\n\nIf you have been largely sedentary and start on a moderate exercise program, you can cut your risk of premature death in half. Spread short exercise sessions throughout your day, as long as the total adds up to about 60 minutes. For example, walk your dog briskly for 20 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes more at night. Add a 20-minute walk and a 10-minute stair-climbing session during your lunch hour and you've met your goal.\n\nAll types of physical activity are good for you and will lower your risk of heart disease and other illnesses as long as you do them regularly. Of course, the more exercise you do, and the more vigorous, the greater the health benefits. Increase your activity level gradually by adding more vigorous exercises, such as jogging or swimming, to your walking regimen.\n\nPeople tend to become less active as they get older, but the need for physical activity does not diminish with age. In fact, you will see positive results even if you don't start exercising until you are older. Previously sedentary people who begin exercising in their 50s, 60s, or older can significantly reduce their risk of dying of a heart attack, even if they already have a heart condition. Exercise also increases the flexibility of your joints and the strength of your muscles, reducing your risk of fractures and enabling you to stay active and independent as you age.\n\nIncorporate more physical activity into your daily routine. Get off the bus a stop or two early and walk the rest of the way to work. Use the stairs instead of the elevator whenever you can. Go for bike rides with your children, and take family walks after dinner. Do your own yard work and gardening. In bad weather, walk around the local shopping mall a few times. On weekends, plan active outings such as hiking, skiing, or ice-skating instead of going to the movies. Ride a stationary bike or use hand weights while you watch TV. Take the family on a hiking or biking vacation.\n\n[Terrorism > WARNING! > When to Stop Exercising]\nAlthough exercise provides numerous health benefits, it is important to know when to stop.

Let's say that you're 40 years old. First, subtract your age from 220 ( $220 - 40 = 180$ ). The resulting number (180 beats per minute) is your maximum target heart rate. To find your target heart rate range, multiply that number by 50 percent to find the low end and 80 percent to find the high end ( $180 \\times 0.50 = 90$  and  $180 \\times 0.80 = 144$ ). Your target heart rate range is 90 to 144 beats per minute.\n\nThe easiest way to check your heart rate is to count your heartbeats for 6 seconds right after an exercise session and multiply that number by 10 to find the number of heart beats in a minute. To count your heartbeats, place the tips of your middle and index fingers (don't use your thumb) on your throat to one side of your Adam's apple or on the inside of your wrist. As soon as you feel your pulse, start counting the beats for 6 seconds. Multiply the number of beats by 10. If your rate is below or above your target heart rate range, adjust your exercise by making it more or less strenuous.\n\n[Terrorism > Finding Your Target Heart Rate > Taking your pulse]\nTo take your pulse, place the tips of your middle and index fingers (not your thumb) on your throat to one side of your Adam's apple (top) or on the inside of your wrist (bottom).

As you get older, you lose up to half a pound of muscle every year, and the muscle is replaced by fat. This process translates into a 1 to 2 percent loss of strength each year. Over time, the loss in strength can reduce your ability to move, ultimately resulting in a loss of physical independence in old age. Performing strengthening exercises regularly two or three times a week does the following:\n\n- Improves your balance, reducing falls.\n\n- Strengthens your bones, reducing your risk of osteoporosis and fractures.\n- Boosts your metabolism (the chemical processes that take place in your body), increasing the rate at which you burn calories.\n- Relieves pain from arthritis.\n- Improves your state of mind.\n- Strengthens your heart.\n- Helps you sleep better.\n- Improves the quality of your life.\n\nEven if you don't start until your 80s or 90s, strength conditioning will help you perform daily tasks—such as lifting grocery bags or getting up from a chair—that can get more difficult as you get older. A small change in muscle size can make a big difference in strength, which can help you remain independent.\n\nKeep in mind that if you stop doing aerobic exercise for more than 2 weeks or so, you will start to lose some of the health benefits you have gained. To stay at your more fit level, stick with your aerobic exercise program. Vary your workouts so you won't get bored. Jog or walk briskly a few times each week, swim for a couple of days, and then use a stationary bike or rowing machine for the remaining days of the week. Do an aerobics routine with a video. Think of ways to modify your routine to keep you motivated.\n\n[Terrorism > Staying Strong as You Age > *Strength-Conditioning Exercise*]\nStrength-conditioning exercises make you fit by building muscle strength and can be as beneficial for your heart as aerobic exercise. Weight training (using free weights or weight machines) is an efficient way to strengthen your muscles. However, doing sit-ups, push-ups, pull-ups, lunges, and leg lifts can accomplish the same goal. Strength-conditioning exercises are sometimes referred to as resistance exercises because they force your muscles to work against, or resist, an object such as a 10-pound weight or the weight of your body.\n\nYou don't have to buy any special equipment to build muscle. Lift soup cans or books. Of course, you can buy inexpensive hand and ankle weights or a resistance band at your local sporting-goods store to use at home. Joining a health club will give you access to a variety of weight machines that can condition all of your muscle groups.\n\nIf you work out with weights or a weight machine, start with the heaviest weight you can manage to perform 8 to 15 repetitions without stopping. You may have to begin with weights as light as 1 or 2 pounds. Starting with weights that are too heavy can injure your muscles. Exhale as you lift or push the weight, and inhale as you relax.

Being overweight increases your risk of developing a number of common chronic illnesses, including heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer. Overweight children are developing these disorders at younger and younger ages.\n\nObesity is a complicated chronic disorder caused by a combination of inherited, physical, behavioral, socioeconomic, and cultural factors. People seem to inherit a preset weight range below which it is difficult to stay. While it is possible to keep your weight down near the lower end of your inherited weight range, it would be difficult to stay below it permanently.\n\n[Terrorism > Are You Overweight?]\nDetermining if you are at a healthy weight involves the number of pounds you weigh and the percentage of your body that is made up of fat. The way in which fat is distributed on your body—around your waist or around your hips—can also influence your health risks. Women naturally have more body fat than men, especially around the hips and thighs. There is no easy way to measure the amount of fat on your body, but in general, the more active you are, the less your percentage of body fat is likely to be. To find your healthy weight, check the body mass index (BMI) chart on page 11.\n\n[Terrorism > The Risks of Being Overweight]\nBeing overweight is a major risk factor for a number of chronic disorders. Where on your body you carry excess weight can also influence your risk of health problems. People who tend to accumulate fat around their waistline are at greater risk of disorders such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke than are people who tend to accumulate fat around their hips and thighs. Women are at\n\nincreased risk of health problems if their waistline is larger than 35 inches; men if their waistline is larger than 40 inches. Your risk of health problems increases if your BMI (see page 11) is 25 or greater.\n\nIf you already have a health problem associated with being overweight, losing weight will probably help you control it. Even a 10 percent reduction in body weight has health benefits. For some disorders, such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, weight loss can help reduce or even eliminate the need for medication. Even if you are overweight, if you exercise regularly, you can still gain benefits from physical activity, such as a reduced risk of heart disease.\n\n[Terrorism > The Risks of Being Overweight > *Heart Disease*]\nBeing overweight is a major risk factor for heart disease. Although not all the mechanisms involved are known, several factors link obesity to heart disease:\n\n- Being overweight increases the level of total cholesterol and other fats called triglycerides in the blood, which can cause fatty deposits to build up in artery walls.\n- Being overweight lowers the blood level of HDL (good) cholesterol, which keeps blood vessels healthy.\n- Being overweight increases the risk of diabetes, which increases the risk of having a heart attack.\n\n[Terrorism > The Risks of Being Overweight > *High Blood Pressure*]\nBeing overweight is the No. 1 factor contributing to high blood pressure. In a large percentage of people who have high blood pressure, losing even a modest amount of weight—just 10 pounds—can often bring blood pressure down to a healthy level. Blood pressure readings go down within the first 2 or 3 weeks of weight loss. The percentage of a person's weight that is made up of fat seems to affect blood pressure more than does total body weight. For this reason, strengthening exercises (see page 9) such as weight lifting, push-ups, and leg lifts, which build muscle and reduce body fat, can help keep blood pressure down.\n\n[Terrorism > The Risks of Being Overweight > *Type 2 Diabetes*]\nMore than 16 million Americans have type 2 diabetes, and about a third of them don't know it because the disorder causes no symptoms in the early stages. Type 2 diabetes tends to run in families, but being overweight is a stronger risk factor than heredity. This means that even if you have a family history of diabetes, you can prevent it or delay it by keeping your weight within a healthy range and getting plenty of exercise. Long-term effects of diabetes include blindness, kidney disease, and poor circulation (which frequently results in amputation of lower limbs). People with diabetes also have an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure.\n\n[Terrorism > The Risks of Being Overweight > *Cancer*]\nBeing overweight appears to increase a person's chances of developing some types of cancer, including cancer of the gallbladder, colon, prostate, uterus, kidney, ovary, and breast. Obesity has also been linked to cancers of the liver, pancreas, rectum, and esophagus.

Losing weight is difficult, and going off of a diet is common, especially during holidays and on other special occasions. Successful weight loss depends on setting realistic goals. For example, losing 10 percent of your total body weight within 6 months is a\n\nsensible goal that you can probably reach and, most important, maintain. The sense of accomplishment you get from reaching your goal will encourage you to keep the weight off and possibly lose more.\n\nFad diets that promise quick and easy results usually deliver nothing but disappointment. Such diets can even harm your health. For example, diets that eliminate entire food groups such as carbohydrates can cause you to become deficient in essential nutrients such as amino acids. High-protein diets are often high in saturated fat, which can raise cholesterol levels. The surest way to lose weight and keep it off is by eating fewer calories and being more physically active. Follow the healthy eating advice in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (see page 37).\n\nDoctors recommend losing about 1 to 2 pounds per week. To lose 1 pound per week, you need to burn 3,500 calories more in a week than you take in. You can achieve this by reducing the number of calories you eat by 500 to 1,000 per day or by boosting the number of calories your body burns by the same amount, through increased physical activity. You can lose weight even faster by both reducing calories and exercising more. For example, an inactive 200-pound person who continues to take in the same number of calories but begins walking briskly 1½ miles each day will lose about 14 pounds in a year. By decreasing his or her calorie intake at the same time, he or she will lose substantially more.\n\nAbout three fourths of the calories you burn every day are used to meet your body's basic needs—sleeping, digesting food, and breathing. Any additional physical activity will burn extra calories. You use only a small number of calories when you sit quietly, but you can burn many more when you walk, ride a bike, jog, swim, lift weights, or play tennis. Engaged in the same activity, a heavier person burns more calories per minute than a lighter person does. For example, a person who weighs 150 pounds burns one third more calories than does a person who weighs 100 pounds. Working harder or faster at a given activity only slightly increases the number of calories you burn. Increasing the amount of time you spend on the activity is a better way to burn more calories.\n\n[Terrorism > WARNING! > Over-the-Counter Weight-Loss Drugs]\nMany over-the-counter weight-loss drugs contain phenylpropanolamine (PPA), which is also found in some over-the-counter nasal decongestants. (In 2004, the FDA banned the use of ephedra, also called ma huang, in over-the-\n\ncounter products.) PPA can increase the risk of stroke from bleeding in the brain. Read all package labels carefully, and do not buy any over-the-counter drugs that contain PPA.\n\nIf you plan to start a weight-loss program to lose more than 20 pounds, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor first, especially if you have a health problem, are significantly overweight, or have been inactive for a long time. In the meantime, here are a few helpful suggestions for successful weight loss:\n\n- Get support from friends and family.\n- Focus on the many positive health benefits you will get from losing weight.\n- Eat smaller, more frequent meals.\n- Don't skip meals, especially breakfast.\n- Set reasonable goals.\n- Make gradual changes in your diet and level of physical activity.\n- Exercise for at least 1 hour each day.\n\n[Terrorism > If You Are Underweight]\nSome people are underweight because of an eating disorder (see page 725) or because they have a condition, such as cancer, that causes weight loss. Because they need to maintain their weight or even add pounds, they have to take in more calories each day than they burn.\n\nIf you are underweight, you can do a number of things to gain additional pounds. Choose high-calorie foods, but make sure that they are rich in nutrients; good examples are peanut butter, cheese, and milk shakes. Eat high-calorie fruits such as bananas, dried fruit, and canned fruit in syrup. Eat high-calorie vegetables such as olives, avocados, and corn. Eat two or three snacks between the three main meals of your day, but leave plenty of time between your meals and snacks so that you don't feel stuffed.\n\nAdd extra calories to your meals by using milk instead of water in soups and sauces. Put a slice of cheese over a baked potato or on your sandwich. Mix wheat germ or powdered milk into casseroles. Make high-calorie shakes with fruit juice, yogurt, and bananas, or buy liquid nutritional supplements.\n\n[Terrorism > Reducing Stress]\nThe stress response is how the body reacts to threatening, overwhelmin", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "diet", "relation": "can harm", "tail": "health"}, {"head": "diets that eliminate", "relation": "can harm", "tail": "health"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

The brain can easily become overloaded with the constant release of the stress hormone cortisol, which can kill brain cells directly, impairing a person's ability to remember and learn. The constant release of cortisol makes us feel fatigued but we can't sleep; then we get anxious and depressed.\n\nMost people are aware of the psychological effects of stress, such as an inability to think clearly, make sound judgments, and remember. But stress also can produce angry outbursts, hostility, impatience, and reduced self-esteem, and can lead to depression and a wide range of physical problems, including headaches, indigestion, stomachaches (especially in children), and backaches. Stress can also cause dizziness, a rapid heartbeat, ringing in the ears, and muscle tightness.\n\nEven more serious, stress can contribute to the development of heart disease by damaging the arteries. The increase in blood pressure that occurs during a stress response exerts so much force on the linings of the arteries that it injures them, triggering an immune system response and making the artery walls susceptible to the buildup of plaque—deposits of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances. As these deposits build up, they make the arteries narrower and less able to carry blood to the heart.\n\nThe constant release of cortisol during chronic stress also causes high blood sugar (glucose) levels, triggering the release of the hormone insulin, which regulates the body's use of glucose for energy. The excessive, long-term release of insulin can eventually make the body resistant to the effects of the hormone, a condition that causes glucose to build up in the blood. This buildup of glucose in the blood can lead to type 2 diabetes (see page 894).\n\n[Terrorism > Are You Under Too Much Stress?]\nIf you are trying to cope with a stressful situation, you may be at increased risk of stress-related illness. Keep in mind that positive changes (such as getting married or having a baby) can produce stress just as easily as negative changes. Here are some examples of common stressful situations:\n\n- Someone close to you died.\n- You recently were divorced or separated.\n- You or a family member has been hospitalized recently.\n- You got married recently.\n- You lost your job or retired.\n- You are having sex problems.\n- You just had a baby.\n- Your finances recently became a lot better or worse.\n- You changed jobs.\n- A child has left home recently or come back home.\n- You got a promotion at work.\n- You moved, or are remodeling your house.\n- Your job is at risk.\n- You have taken on substantial debt, such as a mortgage.\n\nTake steps to manage your stress before it overwhelms you or makes you sick. See the next page for the best ways to handle the stress in your life.\n\n[Terrorism > Stress and Sleep]\nDoctors have known for many years that lack of sleep can cause foggy thinking and poor concentration. But lack of sleep also can lead to potentially serious health problems. For example, chronic lack of sleep can place you at risk of developing type 2 diabetes (see page 894). Cortisol, a stress hormone that regulates the blood sugar glucose, seems to be to blame. Prolonged sleeplessness causes the body to continuously release cortisol into the bloodstream. This, in turn, causes a rise in glucose in the blood that prompts the body to release more and more insulin in an attempt to lower the glucose level. Over time, the increased production of insulin leads to insulin resistance, a condition in which the cells no longer respond to the effects of insulin; insulin\n\nresistance usually leads to type 2 diabetes. An excess of insulin in the blood also encourages the body to store fat, boosting the risk of obesity.\n\nThe chronic release of stress hormones caused by sleep deprivation affects your immune system, making you more susceptible to colds and infections. Also, because your immune system helps your body fight cancer, reduced immune system function from insufficient sleep can put you at increased risk of developing cancer.\n\nChronic lack of sleep can also accelerate the aging process. When you don't get enough sleep, your brain doesn't make the normal amounts of hormones, producing hormone levels similar to those of a much older person. However, subsequently getting a full night's sleep reverses this aging effect, returning hormone levels to normal.\n\nTo get a full night's sleep, try going to bed earlier than you usually do. Use some of the time you might spend relaxing in front of the TV for needed sleep. Keep your bedroom cool (but not cold); most people find it difficult to sleep in a room that is too hot.\n\nIf you have trouble getting a good night's sleep, the following strategies may be helpful:\n\n- Go to bed and get up at the same time every day—even on weeken", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "cortisol", "relation": "impairs", "tail": "ability to remember and learn"}, {"head": "stress", "relation": "produces", "tail": "angry outbursts"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

On your days off, do something fun with your family or a friend. Take a vacation every year or at least try to get away for a long weekend. If you can't leave town, take time off work to relax at home, finish projects, or enjoy hobbies or other activities.\n\n[Terrorism > *Concentrate on the Present*]\nDon't brood about things that happened in the past. Holding on to regrets, anger, or old grudges is especially harmful because it can keep you from enjoying life. Don't worry about the future. Think about the future in terms of changes you can make. Try not to worry about circumstances you cannot control.\n\n[Terrorism > *Take Action*]\nOnce you have decided what to do about a problem, act quickly and decisively. Being proactive can give you a sense of accomplishment and can often immediately eliminate a source of stress. However, don't act impulsively—especially if you are angry. Wait until you have calmed down and worked out a sensible plan before you take action.\n\n[Terrorism > *Don't Play the Blame Game*]\nAvoid blaming other people for your problems. Even if you have been treated badly, holding on to feelings of anger, frustration, or hostility can be harmful to your health. Also, blaming other people prevents you from making positive, constructive changes that can help you avoid similar problems in the future.\n\n[Terrorism > *Get Help*]\nIf you feel that you can no longer cope, get help. Talk to your doctor, contact your hospital social services department, or go to a community mental health agency for a referral to a mental health professional. You also may benefit from joining a support group for people who have similar problems. Your doctor may recommend counseling\n\nto help you learn more positive ways to deal with stress or may prescribe medication such as an antidepressant. Medication can sometimes be effective for treating stress, but it is most effective when used in conjunction with one-on-one counseling or therapy.\n\n[Terrorism > The Relaxation Response]\nDeveloped by Herbert Benson, MD, at Harvard Medical School in the early 1970s, the relaxation response is a simple technique that draws on the meditative practices of Eastern philosophies. The relaxation response has been shown to reverse the effects of stress on the body. It is a simple technique that you can complete in about 20 minutes.\n\nIf you are experiencing stress, try to do this exercise twice a day (but wait until at least 2 hours after your last meal):\n\n1. Sit quietly in a relaxed position.\n2. Close your eyes.\n3. Starting at your feet, consciously relax your muscles. Work your way up your body, relaxing your legs, pelvic region, back, chest, arms, neck, and face.\n4. Breathe naturally with your mouth closed. Be conscious of your breathing. Say the word “one” silently to yourself every time you exhale.\n5. If distracting thoughts enter your mind, ignore them and concentrate on your breathing. Let the thoughts pass.\n6. Stay relaxed and concentrate on your breathing. Keep repeating “one” to yourself for 10 to 20 minutes.\n7. When you are finished, don’t get up right away. Stay seated for a few minutes, first with your eyes closed and then with your eyes open, to gradually refocus on your surroundings.\n8. Don’t worry about whether you have done the exercise correctly. Just allow the relaxation to occur at its own pace.\n\nIf you don’t have time to do the relaxation response exercise twice a day, or if you find yourself in an especially stressful situation, try to do the following exercise. This shorter exercise is especially helpful when you feel overwhelmed by events in your life and need a quick calming fix. You can do it anywhere—waiting in line, stopped at a red light, or on hold on the telephone.\n\n1. Relax and focus on your breathing. Count slowly to yourself backward from 10 to zero, one number per breath.\n2. When you reach zero, pause for a moment before resuming your activities.\n3. If you don’t feel relaxed, repeat the exercise.\n\n[Terrorism > Staying Safe]\nWhere you live, what you do for a living, and how you spend your leisure time are some of the factors that affect your health and safety. You can take a number of practical steps to help ensure that you and your family are safe at home and on the road. Many of these measures are simple—such as using seat belts each and every time you drive. Others—such as developing a home fire evacuation plan—require preparation and vigilance over time. If you use a commonsense approach to safety and supervise your young children, you can be assured that your family will remain relatively safe.\n\n[Terrorism > Keeping Your Children Safe]\nYoung children rely on adults to protect them from accidents and injury because they lack the judgment and experience to protect themselves.

Use the following guidelines to tackle this project, but keep in mind that no safety\n\ndevice is completely childproof. You still need to closely watch your young children to keep them safe.\n\n- Buy safety latches and locks for cabinets and drawers in the kitchen and bathroom to prevent poisoning and other injuries. These inexpensive devices can stop your child from gaining access to household cleaners and other chemicals, medicines, and sharp objects such as knives. Make sure the latches and locks are sturdy enough to withstand pulling by small hands.\n- Put up safety gates to keep children away from stairs and other dangerous areas in the home. At the top of the stairs, anchor the gate to the wall with screws so it can't be dislodged. Check the gate to ensure that it has no openings large enough for a child's head to fit through.\n- In the kitchen, turn all stovetop pot handles inward when cooking so your child cannot reach up and pull down a pot.\n- Set your water heater temperature no higher than 120°F to prevent scalding, or buy an antiscalding device for your faucets.\n- Install spring-loaded electrical outlet covers to prevent electric shock and electrocution.\n- Cut your window blind and drapery cords to prevent a child from strangling in the cord loops. You can also install cord cleats or tension devices to keep cords out of reach. Check at your local hardware store. You can get free replacement tassels, cord stops, and tie-down devices from the Window Covering Safety Council (1-800-506-4636).\n- Put safety bumpers on the corners and edges of furniture and fireplace hearths to prevent injury should your child fall on them. Remove any furniture that has sharp corners and edges.\n- Minimize your child's exposure to lead (see page 425).\n- Have your garage door professionally inspected to make sure that it is pinch-resistant and has properly working photo eyes and reversing mechanism. Teach children never to play with the garage door or its control panel or remote controls.\n- Don't keep a gun in the house (see page 72).", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "safety latches", "relation": "prevent", "tail": "injuries"}, {"head": "household cleaners", "relation": "cause", "tail": "poisoning"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

Hazards that are clear to adults may not be obvious to children. Supervision is still the best way to prevent injury. Give children extra guidance, especially when they are learning to walk. Make your home a safer place for children by following this simple advice:\n\n- Never leave infants alone on beds or changing tables. Strap infants and toddlers securely into high chairs and strollers. Put guardrails on the beds of young children.\n- Don't use infant walkers. Not only can they roll down stairs, but they can also delay a child's development of motor skills and may encourage a child to walk on his or her toes.\n- Bolt safety gates to the wall at the top of stairs.\n- Do not let children play on balconies or fire escapes.\n\n- Install window locks or guards on all windows, or keep windows closed and locked when children are present.\n- Supervise your children closely at all times while grocery shopping. Don't let children of any age play with, push, climb in and out of, or ride on the outside of a grocery cart. Always strap babies and toddlers into a grocery cart; switch to another cart if the belt is broken or missing. Never let a child stand up or lean over while sitting in a cart. Children who weigh more than 35 pounds should not ride in the baby seat of grocery carts (even when the child is strapped in, his or her weight can make the cart top-heavy and tip it over).\n\n[Terrorism > Keeping Your Children Safe > *Toy Safety*]\nToys can help a child have fun and learn. However, some toys pose a hazard to young children because they have small parts or can cause a fall. More than 100,000 children are treated at hospital emergency departments every year for injuries caused by toys. Sixty percent of these children are under age 4. Injuries often occur when a young child misuses or plays with a toy designed for older children. Boys are more susceptible than girls to injury from a toy. Most toy-related injuries occur to the head and face. Latex (rubber) balloons (see page 62), which cause choking, are by far the most dangerous toy. Riding toys such as toy cars, scooters, and bicycles account for a large proportion of toy-related injuries and deaths. Most injuries occur when a child falls from the riding toy, but they also occur when the child rides the toy into traffic or into a body of water.\n\nHere are some tips to help you choose toys that are both fun and safe for your child:\n\n- Look for toys that are designed for your child's age group.\n\n[Terrorism > Keeping Your Children Safe > **Falls From Windows**]\nUnsupervised young children can easily fall from an open window. In the United States, 15,000 children are injured every year and 15 to 20 die after falling from a window. Five times more children who live in apartment buildings—especially those without air conditioning—fall from windows than children who live in single-family homes. A child can be injured or killed falling from a window of any height, even from a first-floor window onto a soft surface.\n\nTo keep your child from falling out of an open window, install window guards or window stops. The metal bars of most window\n\nguards are spaced no more than 4 inches apart. The guards screw into the side of a window frame, come in different sizes to fit various window types, and can be adjusted for width. Some window guards are designed to be opened easily by an adult (allowing escape from a fire) but are difficult for a young child to open.

A third of the injuries occur in children who have been skate-boarding for less than a week. Common skateboard injuries include sprains, fractures, bruises, and cuts and scrapes from falls. Riding on irregular surfaces, performing risky stunts, and lack of experience, balance, and body control (which is common in children under 15) are factors that contribute to injuries. Falls and collisions with objects or vehicles such as cars can be fatal.\n\nTo lower your child's risk of being injured while riding a skateboard, teach him or her to follow these safety guidelines:\n\n- Check your skateboard after each use. Make sure it doesn't have any broken or loose parts, sharp edges, or cracked wheels. If it does, don't use it again until it has been fixed by a qualified repair-person.\n- Wear protective clothing such as a helmet; slip-resistant, closed-toe shoes; elbow and knee pads; wrist guards; gloves; and a padded jacket and shorts. Protective gear is not required to conform to government safety guidelines, so be careful when making a selection. Choose gear that fits properly and does not obstruct your hearing or vision.\n- Stay away from irregular surfaces. More than half of all skateboard injuries occur from riding on holes, bumps, rocks, or debris. Check the area where you intend to ride. Better yet, use a designated skateboard park.\n- Don't show off. Difficult stunts take careful practice in an area designed for skateboards. Never hitch a ride from a bicycle, car, or other moving vehicle.\n\n- Learn how to fall. If you lose your balance, crouch down low (to shorten the distance you fall), avoid stiffening your body, and roll with the fall. Try to land on the fleshy parts of your body (such as the thighs or buttocks) instead of trying to break the fall with your arms or hands.\n\n[Terrorism > *Skateboards* > *Playground Safety*]\nPlaygrounds are exciting areas for children to explore and develop motor and social skills. But no national regulations exist for the manufacture or installation of playground equipment, although the federal government has established voluntary guidelines for equipment and ground surfaces. When taking your children to a public playground, it's up to you to check the equipment to make sure it is safe. Look for the following playground safety features:\n\n- Surfaces around the playground equipment should have at least 12 inches of wood chips, mulch, sand, or pea gravel, or be made of safety-tested rubber material.\n- The protective surface should extend at least 6 feet from play equipment in all directions. Surfaces around swings should extend to twice the height of the suspending bar both in front and in back.\n- Play structures that are more than 30 inches high should be spaced at least 9 feet apart and have guardrails to prevent falls.\n- Openings in guardrails or between ladder rungs should be less than 3½ inches or more than 9 inches.\n- Sharp points or edges on hardware such as bolt ends should not protrude from the equipment.\n- Tripping hazards such as tree roots or stumps or exposed concrete footings should be eliminated.\n\nDon't let young children climb higher than 4 feet (5 feet for older children) because, at greater heights, even recommended surfaces cannot adequately absorb a child's fall. Check your neighborhood playgrounds regularly to make sure the equipment and surfaces are in good condition. Always keep an eye on your children at the playground because supervision is the best way to prevent injuries.\n\n[Terrorism > *Skateboards* > *Child Safety Seats*]\nIn the United States, motor vehicle collisions are the No. 1 cause of death among children. The best way to protect your child from the risk of injury and death on the road is by using a child safety seat. When purchasing a child safety seat, select one that is right for your child's age and weight, and make sure it fits in your car. Before buying a car seat, try it out in your car to make sure it can be installed properly. Nearly four out of five child safety seats are used improperly because the methods of attachment in different types of motor vehicles vary widely. The three most common mistakes people make when installing car seats are failing to belt the seat into the vehicle tightly enough, keeping the harness straps too loose, and not placing the harness retainer clip at the level of the child's armpit.\n\nAll child safety seats manufactured after September 2002 have been standardized. Every new vehicle sold in the United States includes an installation system that uses upper tethers and lower anchors to secure child safety seats.

These same advances can expose them to pornography and violence and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by online sexual predators. To lower the chances of your child being victimized, take the following steps:\n\n- Keep the computer in the den or family room—not in your child's bedroom—so the screen is visible to all family members.\n- Use blocking software and other parental control devices provided by your service provider.\n- Explain the possibility of online sexual exploitation, especially in chat rooms, to your child.\n- Ask your child to show you his or her favorite Web sites and discuss his or her choices.\n- Check your child's e-mail messages from time to time, and tell your child why you are doing so.\n- Find out if computer safeguards are used by your child's school, the library, and the parents of your child's friends.\n- Teach your children never to arrange a face-to-face meeting with strangers they chat with online, never post photographs of themselves on the Internet, and never give out identifying information such as a telephone number.\n\nHere are some signs that your child might be engaging in potentially risky behavior on the Internet:\n\n- Your child turns the computer screen off or changes it when you come into the room.\n- Your child spends long periods of time online, especially at night.\n\n- You find pornography on your child's computer.\n- Your child gets or makes phone calls to numbers you don't recognize, especially long distance.\n- Your child gets mail or gifts from someone you don't know.\n- Your child uses an online account belonging to someone else.\n\nIf you notice any of these signs, talk to your child about your suspicions openly. Explain that even if your child is a willing participant, he or she is not at fault because the adult always bears full responsibility for such exploitation. If your child ever receives child or adult pornography online or in the mail or if anyone ever sexually solicits your child, call your local police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\n[Terrorism > Keeping Your Home Safe]\nMany people are injured in their own homes. This section covers basic safety guidelines you can use to make your home as safe as possible. Go through your home room by room to check for safety hazards, especially those that might not be easily visible. Taking a few simple measures, such as installing carbon monoxide detectors and keeping stairs free of clutter, can eliminate many potential dangers.\n\n[Terrorism > Keeping Your Home Safe > *Preventing Falls in the Home*]\nFalls are the leading cause of accidental death and one of the major causes of injury and death among people older than 65. Most fatal falls occur within the home, mainly on stairs and steps, or from beds and ladders. People over 65 are at increased risk of falling because of reduced vision, slower reaction times, and medical conditions and medications that can affect balance.\n\nYou can lower the chances of falls in your home by taking a few simple precautions to fallproof your home. Take steps now to reduce clutter and eliminate slippery surfaces. For ways to protect children from falls, see page 64. Here are some examples of things you can do to make your home safer:\n\n- **Outside** Repair any damaged steps or broken pieces of concrete on sidewalks. Rake or sweep away slippery, wet leaves from sidewalks, stairs, and porches. Eliminate ice from these areas during the winter.\n- **All rooms** Keep electrical and telephone cords away from where people walk. Pick up toys, clothes, newspapers, books, and any other items that don't belong on the floor.\n\nPack away and store extra furniture. Keep your floors clean and dry, and don't wax them. Make sure lighting is adequate. Teach pets not to jump on you or weave between your legs. Arrange your furniture to provide open walkways. Eliminate glass tables, which can shatter during a fall, and furniture that has unprotected sharp edges. If you use area rugs, make sure they have a nonskid backing.\n\n**Kitchen and bathroom** Clean up spills and wipe away standing water immediately. Don't climb onto the counter to reach items on a high shelf; use a sturdy step stool. Place a night-light in the bathroom and in the hallway that leads to it. Place a rubber mat or nonskid stickers in the tub.\n\n**Stairways** Pick up clutter and toys on the stairs. Install handrails on both sides. Put a night-light on the stairway. Consider installing a carpet runner if the wooden steps are slippery.\n\n[Terrorism > Keeping Your Home Safe > *Protecting older people from falls*]\nAs people get older, they can become more susceptible to falls because of increased use of medications, disorders that affect the joints (such as arthritis) or nervous system (such as Parkinson's disease), and age-related ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "blocking software", "relation": "treats", "tail": "online sexual exploitation"}, {"head": "explanation", "relation": "prevents", "tail": "online sexual exploitation"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "child", "relation": "participates in", "tail": "[Event: online chat]"}, {"head": "parent", "relation": "monitors", "tail": "[Event: child's internet activity]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

But the risk to the people in the home, especially to children, far outweighs any security benefits—most shooting victims are family members or friends, not intruders. A person living in a home with a gun is 18 times more likely to be killed by the gun than is a stranger. The risk is higher if the home environment includes a person who is violent or verbally abusive, abuses alcohol or drugs, or is depressed. Each year, nearly 6,000 Americans under age 20 die of gun-related injuries, including unintentional injury, homicide, or suicide. For each child killed by a gun, four others are wounded, many so badly that they become permanently disabled.\n\nTo protect your family from gun-related injury, don't keep a gun in your home. If you are concerned about protection, take other steps to protect your home and family—buy a home security system, put reinforced bars on your windows and dead-bolt locks on your doors, add outdoor lighting, and start a neighborhood watch program.\n\nMany unintentional injuries occur because a curious child or adolescent plays with or handles an improperly stored gun. If you feel the need to keep a gun in your home for security purposes, or if you keep one or more for hunting, lower your family's risk of injury and death by storing it unloaded (with a gun lock in place) in a locked cabinet or drawer. Make the key available only to responsible adults. Don't tell your child where the gun is stored, because he or she may be tempted to show it off to friends. Keep the ammunition in a separate locked cabinet.\n\nTeach your children never to touch a gun, and tell them to call you or another adult if they ever find one, even if they think it may be a toy. When your children are invited to another child's house to play or if they are going to the home of a baby-sitter, ask if there is a gun in the home and if it is properly stored. If the gun is not properly stored, invite the other child or the baby-sitter to your home.\n\n[Terrorism > *Fire Safety*]\nMore than 4,000 people in the United States die in fires each year, and an additional 25,000 are injured. Bedrooms are common sites for fires to start—especially electrical fires—and most home fires occur at night when people are asleep. Many fires occur when extension cords are overloaded or portable space heaters are placed too close to bedclothes or draperies. Other common causes of fires are children playing with matches and smokers falling asleep with a lit cigarette.\n\n[Terrorism > *Preventing home fires*]\nFire is a major cause of injury and death and can rob you of your home and your most treasured possessions. Take steps now to protect your family and home from fire:\n\n- Keep matches and lighters locked away from children.\n- Keep bedding, clothes, curtains, and other combustible items at least 3 feet away from space heaters.\n- Make sure electrical cords are not frayed, especially cords on electric blankets.\n- Don't overload wall outlets.\n- Never smoke in bed.\n- Replace any mattress made before 1973. (Federal mattress flammability standards were raised in 1973.)\n- Install smoke detectors (see below) on every floor of your house. Have one close to the bedrooms.\n- Avoid planting trees or shrubs that can catch or spread fire easily. Consider planting fire-resistant plants around your home.\n- Have your home heating system checked by a professional every year.\n- Place a fire screen in front of your fireplace.\n- Get your chimney cleaned and inspected each year.\n- Consider installing residential fire sprinklers.\n\n[Terrorism > *Preventing home fires* > Smoke Detectors Save Lives]\nSmoke detectors—small, battery-powered devices that sound an alarm when exposed to smoke or fire—dramatically increase your chances of survival in a fire. Install a smoke detector on every floor of your home, and make sure one is installed near the bedrooms. Test the smoke detector every month by pressing the test button on the front of the alarm. Change the batteries once a year. Smoke detectors need to be replaced about every 10 years, or according to the manufacturer's guidelines.\n\nThe best way to protect your family's safety in a fire is to have an escape plan that you practice every month. Plan at least two ways out of every room. If your secondary exit must be through a window, make sure you'll be able to get to the ground safely. If necessary, buy a collapsible ladder that you can quickly and easily hook on the windowsill and hang out the window. If you have security bars or window guards on\n\nyour windows, make sure they are the kind that have a quick-release device so they can be opened quickly in an emergency. Check all of your windows to make sure they are not painted shut or otherwise stuck in a closed position.\n\nWhen you practice your escape plan, rehearse feeling your way out of the house in the dark or with your eyes closed.

Most of the injured are boys between ages 5 and 14 who play with fireworks such as bottle rockets and sparklers, which are sold legally in many states. Burns to the eyes, hands, and face are the most common injuries. Children lack the physical coordination to handle fireworks safely. The safest way to prevent injury from fireworks is not to buy them and to keep them out of your home and away from children. Enjoy fireworks displays at a local show put on by professionals who are trained to use them safely.\n\n[Terrorism > Motor Vehicle Safety]\nDriving defensively may not be enough to keep you safe on the road. Collisions and breakdowns can make you vulnerable to injury from passing vehicles. Alcohol is a factor in more than 40 percent of all fatal motor vehicle crashes, and nearly 300,000 people are injured in alcohol-related collisions each year. The best defense is to wear your seat belt each and every time you drive. Don't forget to buckle up your children in an age-appropriate safety seat (see page 67), and never let a child age 12 or under ride in the front seat because of the risk of injury and death from a passenger-side air bag (see right).\n\n*Seat Belts Save Lives*\n\nSeat belts save thousands of lives each year. If you are not wearing a seat belt and you hit something or slam on your brakes, your vehicle will stop but you will keep moving until you hit the windshield, the dashboard, or the back of a front seat. Wearing a seat belt prevents your body from being thrown around inside or out of the vehicle and can help the driver maintain control of the vehicle in a collision. Buckle up on every trip, no matter how short, and teach your children how to buckle up correctly. Here's the right way to wear a seat belt:\n\n- Adjust the lap belt to fit low and tight across your hips and pelvis, not across your abdomen.\n- Place the shoulder belt snugly across your chest, away from your neck.\n- Never put the shoulder belt behind your back or under your arm.\n\n[Terrorism > Motor Vehicle Safety > *After a Collision*]\nEach year, about one in every eight drivers has a motor vehicle collision. Many are minor rear-end collisions. If your vehicle is rear-ended and you don't feel safe or are uncomfortable getting out of your vehicle in traffic, signal to the other driver to follow you and then drive to the nearest police station, convenience store, or gas station to look at the damage and exchange insurance information. Some states require vehicles involved in a collision to remain at the site.\n\nThe following tips can help keep you safe when you are involved in a more serious collision:\n\n- Stop your vehicle if it is safe to do so, and then carefully move it out of traffic if you can.\n- Turn off the ignition of all vehicles involved in the collision.\n- Check all the people in each of the vehicles to see if they need medical help.\n- Call the police and, if necessary, call emergency medical assistance.\n\n[Terrorism > Motor Vehicle Safety > **WARNING!** > **Air Bag Safety for Children**]\nAir bags can save lives in a collision, but they inflate with a force powerful enough to kill or severely injure a child or small adult riding or driving in the front seat. Air bags can inflate after only a slight impact. Also, so-called smart air bags—which are designed to adjust their inflation force according\n\nto the size of the passenger or driver (or switch off entirely if the passenger is a young child)—are not 100 percent reliable. Any number of circumstances (such as humidity, shifting body weight on or off seats, the added weight of a child seat, extra tension in safety belts, and reclined seats) can cause air bags to deploy when they shouldn't, or not to inflate when they should. All children age 12 or under (including infants) should ride in the backseat to prevent serious injury or death from inflation of the vehicle's air bag.\n\n[Terrorism > Motor Vehicle Safety > *If Your Vehicle Breaks Down*]\nIf your vehicle breaks down along a busy road or highway, your greatest danger is getting hit by a passing vehicle. The problem is worsened by the elimination of roadside shoulders, which were designed as a place for disabled vehicles to stop but, in many places, are now being replaced with additional driving lanes. The following steps can minimize the danger if your car breaks down on the highway:\n\n- Pull off the road as far as possible.\n- Turn on your hazard lights and the interior dome light.\n- Put a white handkerchief or cloth on the antenna, and raise your hood.\n- Don't stand next to or behind your car, and don't walk along the highway. If you can, wait on the other side of the guardrail, well away from the highway. Or wait for help inside your vehicle with the doors locked.

A young child can drown in a few seconds in 1 inch of water left in a bucket or wading pool. Even older children are at risk—drowning is a common cause of death in children under age 15. Follow these simple measures to protect children from water accidents:\n\n- Always supervise children closely when they are around water, and make sure they wear a US Coast Guard-approved life preserver or life jacket whenever they are in a boat or near a body of water. Don't rely on inflatable toys or water wings to keep a child afloat.\n- Never leave young children alone in the tub, even for a few seconds. Bathtub seats are not safety devices and can tip over, trapping a child underwater.\n- Empty the bathtub and all buckets immediately after use.\n- Install a toilet lid lock to prevent children from falling into the toilet.\n- Sign children up for swimming lessons at about age 5. Children younger than 5 are not yet ready to learn how to swim and may take risks around water.\n- Teach children never to swim alone.\n- Warn children about the dangers of walking or skating on frozen lakes or rivers.\n\n[Terrorism > *Water Safety for Kids* > *Home Swimming Pools*]\nNationwide, hundreds of drownings occur in home swimming pools each year. Most of the casualties are children under age 5. Young children are unpredictable and need to be supervised constantly around water. It takes only a second for a child to become submerged—with no time to scream for help. Some simple measures can lower the chances of having an accident in your home pool:\n\n- Never leave a child in a pool unattended.\n- Keep a phone by the pool so you can call for help quickly.\n- Learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and insist that all your baby-sitters learn it too.\n- Don't get a home swimming pool until your youngest child is 5 years old.\n- Encircle your pool with a self-locking fence that is at least 48 inches tall and has vertical bars spaced no more than 4 inches apart. The fence should completely separate the pool from the house. Don't leave furniture or toys near the fence that a child could climb on to reach the pool.\n- Keep a pole, rope, and personal flotation device near the pool for rescue purposes.\n- Make sure that no standing water has collected in the pool cover; drownings can occur in inches of water.\n- Prevent electric shock by keeping electrical appliances away from the pool.\n\n[Terrorism > *Water Safety for Kids* > *At the Beach*]\nThe beach is a great place to take your family for recreation. To make each trip to the beach as safe as possible, follow these beach-safety measures:\n\n- Stay inside the designated swimming area, preferably in sight of a lifeguard.\n- Don't swim alone.\n- Check beach conditions for bad weather or other potential hazards.\n- Don't swim near piers, rafts, docks, pilings, or diving platforms—you could injure your head, neck, or spine, or someone could dive into you. Also, rip currents (seaward-moving water currents, which are difficult to swim against) tend to intensify around fixed objects such as piers.\n- If caught in a rip current, swim parallel to shore until you are out of the current. Don't try to swim against the current.\n- Be alert for dangerous aquatic life such as jellyfish.\n- Stay close to the shore so you have enough energy to swim back.\n\n[Terrorism > Preventing Violence]\nViolence is a major public health problem in the United States. The homicide rate is at least two to three times higher in the United States than in any other industrialized nation, and the homicide rate among Americans under age 24 is nearly eight times higher.\n\nThis chapter focuses on violence in the home. Family violence includes spouse abuse, child abuse, and elder abuse, but it also extends to violence in the media, which has been shown to increase aggressive behavior in children. You will learn how to prevent violence within your family, what to do if someone you know becomes a victim of violence, and how to protect yourself from sexual assault. You also will find tips on teaching your children to solve problems without resorting to violence.\n\n[Terrorism > Preventing Violence > Family Violence]\nIn the United States, most violence is committed in the home by family members—men against their partners, parents against their children, or adult children against their elderly parents. Spouse abuse, also called domestic violence or battering, is the most common form of family violence and the most common cause of injuries to women. Each year, millions of children and as many as half a million elderly Americans become victims of abuse.\n\n[Terrorism > Preventing Violence > Family Violence > *Spouse Abuse*]\nSpouse abuse is recurring coercive behavior intended to intimidate a partner through physical battering (including slapping, punching, kicking, or choking), emotional", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "child", "relation": "at risk of", "tail": "drowning"}, {"head": "life preserver", "relation": "protects", "tail": "children from water accidents"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "parent", "relation": "supervises", "tail": "[Event: child around water]"}, {"head": "child", "relation": "participates in", "tail": "[Event: playing near a body of water]"}, {"head": "parent", "relation": "makes sure", "tail": "[Event: child wears life jacket]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: leaving young children alone in the tub]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: drowning]"}, {"head": "[Event: not wearing a US Coast Guard-approved life preserver or life jacket]", "relation": "increases risk of", "tail": "[Event: water accidents]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Teach your child to be assertive enough to have his or her needs met, without being aggressive. The following steps can help your child become a person who is thoughtful and considerate of other people:\n\n- Give your child plenty of love, respect, and attention. He or she will feel secure and will imitate your behavior when interacting with others.\n- When your child says or does something hurtful to another person, ask him or her to think about how the other person must be feeling and to apologize.\n- Teach your child to use positive problem-solving skills such as talking instead of yelling or hitting.\n- Teach your child to treat everyone with respect.\n- Don't use corporal punishment to discipline your children. Violence doesn't change behavior in the long run and teaches children to resolve problems with violence.\n- Don't let your child watch violent TV shows, movies, DVDs, or videotapes or play violent interactive video or computer games. Frequent exposure to media violence increases aggressive behavior in children.\n\n- Never allow your child to carry a weapon for self-defense. Knives or guns can easily be stolen or cause unintentional injury.\n\n[Terrorism > Media Violence]\nMore than half of all current television programming contains some type of violence. Two thirds of programming targeted to children contains violence. Exposure to violence on television can have a long-term negative impact on children. In addition to desensitizing children to violence, viewing violence on television may increase aggression, as children try to imitate the violence they see. They may learn to accept violence as a legitimate way of solving problems. Seeing violent images on TV also can make a child afraid. Movies, music videos, interactive video games, and computer games are additional sources of violent images.\n\nThe two most important things you can do to protect your children from media violence are to prohibit them from watching TV programs and playing video games with violent content. Here are some additional tips:\n\n- Never put a TV or video game player in your child's bedroom.\n- Watch what your children are watching so you can monitor their viewing and talk about the programs.\n- Teach your children the difference between real life and the fantasy portrayed on TV. Tell them about the real-life consequences of the violent acts they see in the media. Talk about nonviolent ways the characters could have solved their problems.\n- Don't buy violent video games or computer games for your children.\n- Don't take your children to movies or let them watch rented movies that are not recommended for children.\n- Write letters to TV station program managers to request better programming for children.\n\n[Terrorism > Gang Violence]\nA street gang is a group of young people who engage in antisocial, destructive, or violent behavior, often involving criminal activity. A street gang typically claims a particular city block or street corner as its turf and vigorously defends it. Gang\n\nproblems occur primarily in large cities, but gang activity is occurring increasingly in the suburbs and in rural communities. Although the majority of gang members are boys, girls organize and are involved in their own gangs in many areas.\n\nMuch violence occurs between gangs and inside the gang itself. For example, gangs often initiate new members through vicious beatings and may expect new members to commit violent crimes such as armed robbery, rape, drive-by shootings, or even murder to gain acceptance by the group. Sometimes innocent bystanders become victims of gang violence.\n\nYou can make a difference by volunteering to work with young people, serving as a mentor, or providing opportunities for young people to engage in productive neighborhood projects and activities. Be vigilant about potential gang activity by always removing graffiti on your property and asking the police to discourage young people from loitering. Organize a neighborhood watch program and always report gang activity to the police. Find out what the local gang colors and styles of dress are, and discourage your children from wearing them so they won't be mistaken for a gang member.\n\n[Terrorism > Elder Abuse]\nExperts estimate that more than 450,000 older Americans living at home are abused or neglected every year. People age 80 or older experience abuse and neglect two to three times more often than younger people, and older women are abused more often than older men. Two thirds of all abusers of the elderly are their adult children or spouses. The most common forms of elder abuse include:\n\n- **Neglect** Failure to provide or pay for care, shelter, or other necessities for an older person.\n- **Emotional abuse** The use of insults, threats, humiliati", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "child", "relation": "treats", "tail": "aggressive behavior"}, {"head": "love", "relation": "treats", "tail": "secure child"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

People use these treatments in a variety of ways—alone or in combination with other alternative therapies, instead of conventional treatments, or, most often, in addition to conventional treatments.\n\nIf you are using an alternative therapy or are considering trying one, tell your medical doctor. Using an alternative therapy as a substitute for conventional therapy without receiving an accurate diagnosis from a doctor can be harmful to your health. In addition, combining some treatments can be dangerous. For example, some herbs can interact with prescription or over-the-counter medications. Although results from an increasing number of studies on alternative therapies are being published in mainstream medical literature, there remains a general lack of understanding about how conventional and alternative therapies function together. Ask your doctor for scientific information about the safety and effectiveness of a particular treatment you are considering, or consult a reliable source, such as the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health, for guidance.\n\nThe complementary and alternative approaches discussed here are a few examples of the more popular treatments people are trying. These discussions are not endorsements by the American Medical Association of any treatments or therapies. The most widely used alternative treatments include herbal therapies and dietary supplements, acupuncture, mind-body therapies such as meditation, and manipulative therapies such as massage and chiropractic.\n\n[Terrorism > Alternative Medical Systems]\nAlternative medical systems are complete systems of medical theory and practice that have developed outside of conventional medicine. Some systems, such as homeopathy and naturopathy, evolved inside Western culture. Others, such as Chinese medicine and Ayurveda, developed in Eastern cultures. Other traditional medical systems exist in\n\nNative American, African, Middle Eastern, and South American and other cultures. Fragments of these medical systems still exist in the folk medicine practices of many of the people in these cultures, as well as those of many immigrants to the United States.\n\n[Terrorism > Alternative Medical Systems > *Homeopathy*]\nDeveloped in Germany in the 1790s by a physician, homeopathy is based on the theory that “like cures like.” According to this theory, natural ingredients that produce certain symptoms in a healthy person can cure the same symptoms in a sick person when the substances are highly diluted and given in small doses. Homeopathic doctors believe that the more highly diluted the substance, the stronger the medicine. They consider medicines produced in this way to be safer, producing fewer side effects than conventional medicines. The homeopath takes into account the person’s personality and mental and emotional states before prescribing a remedy. Homeopathy is used to treat a wide variety of illnesses. Its theoretical base has not been proven by medical science. A variety of published studies on homeopathy have had mixed results.\n\n[Terrorism > Alternative Medical Systems > *Naturopathy*]\nNaturopathy is an alternative medical system in which practitioners use natural healing forces in the body to help the body cure itself. Typical therapies include changes in diet, massage, water therapy, light therapy, soft tissue manipulation, and exercise as well as interventions such as acupuncture (see below) and minor surgery. Naturopathy views disease as an alteration in the process by which the body stays healthy and emphasizes the reestablishment of health over the treatment of disease. The effectiveness of naturopathy has not been proven scientifically.\n\n[Terrorism > Alternative Medical Systems > *Chinese Medicine*]\nTraditional Chinese medicine is an ancient system of health care that is based on the concept of chi, or qi (pronounced “chee”), the vital energy that flows throughout the body in specific pathways called meridians. According to this theory, disease occurs when the balance of chi is disrupted in the body.

Many drugs in use today are derived from plants, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also has approved more than 200 plant products for sale as dietary supplements. In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated as foods, not drugs. This means that the FDA does not require dietary supplements to undergo the same rigorous approval process required of prescription and over-the-counter medications before they appear on the market. In addition, manufacturers are not required to provide the FDA with evidence that their dietary supplements are safe or\n\neffective before marketing them. However, the FDA can remove a supplement from the market if it determines that the product is unsafe.\n\nAs with pharmaceutical drugs, the effects of herbs can vary greatly from one person to another, influenced by factors such as weight, sex, age, and general physical condition. In addition, the effects of herbs can be more subdued than those of pharmaceutical drugs, and herbs tend to have less noticeable side effects. But unlike most standard medications, herbal remedies can contain potentially harmful substances because of the lack of regulations for production. A manufacturer's growing conditions, storage, handling, and preparation also can affect potency.\n\nAlways let your doctor know about any herbal remedies or dietary supplements you are taking. Don't self-medicate with herbs or supplements without talking to your doctor first and getting a diagnosis. Some of these products can have harmful interactions with prescription and over-the-counter medications. For example, ginkgo biloba can cause excessive bleeding when taken with anticoagulating medications such as aspirin or warfarin.\n\nSome doctors recommend that people stop using supplements for at least 3 weeks before having elective surgery. Although adverse effects are rare, taking some herbs or dietary supplements before undergoing surgery can be harmful. Some supplements can speed or slow heart rate, intensify the effects of anesthesia, inhibit blood clotting, or cause the body to reject a transplanted organ.\n\nThe herbs and supplements discussed here are among the most common in the United States. Research has supported the use of some of these substances. For others, however, there is no scientific proof of effectiveness.\n\n[Terrorism > **Herbal Remedies and Dietary Supplements** > *Aloe Vera*]\nThe gel of the aloe vera plant is used to treat burns and heal skin infections. Companies that make skin-care and cosmetic products incorporate aloe into many of their preparations, including hand lotions and shaving creams. The dried outer leaf of the aloe plant is ingested as a powder or dissolved in liquids to aid digestion and relieve constipation. Aloe may cause intestinal cramping, so you should not consume it if you have an inflammatory intestinal disorder (see page 764) such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or if you have an intestinal obstruction. Do not take aloe during pregnancy because it can trigger contractions of the uterus. Children younger than age 12 should not consume aloe because of its laxative effect.\n\n[Terrorism > *Black Cohosh*]\nAlso known as black snakeroot or bugbane, black cohosh is a traditional Native American remedy for snakebites and gynecologic disorders. Derived from a plant from the buttercup family, black cohosh is used as a dietary supplement to treat hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, such as mood swings, insomnia, and vaginal dryness. It also is taken for the relief of premenstrual syndrome (PMS; see page 850).\n\n[Terrorism > *Black Cohosh* > Alternative Therapies for Menopause]\nDeciding whether to use alternative therapies after menopause is a decision that many women face as they get older. Hormone therapy (see page 853) with estrogen is very effective in relieving symptoms of menopause—such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness—but some forms of hormone therapy carry small but known health risks, especially with long-term use. Many women are considering alternatives to hormone therapy in hopes of alleviating their symptoms and possibly reducing the risks of heart disease and osteoporosis.\n\nOptions that postmenopausal women have explored include natural or plant estrogens, acupuncture, and herbal supplements such as black cohosh, red clover, hops, dong quai, and ginseng. Of the herbal supplements, black cohosh seems to be the most effective in reducing symptoms of menopause, but not enough evidence exists to determine whether any of these therapies are safe over the long term. Limited studies have shown that plant estrogens—such as those present in soy products, wild yams, and flaxseed—may benefit some women who have hot flashes.

Today it is taken internally to boost the immune system and to treat upper respiratory infections such as colds and the flu. Studies testing its effectiveness in reducing cold symptoms have had mixed results. Echinacea can cause allergic reactions in some people or interfere with immune-suppressing drugs (such as those prescribed to prevent rejection after an organ or tissue transplant).\n\n[Terrorism > *Ephedra*]\nAlso called ma huang, ephedra is a herbal Chinese medicine used for treating asthma and hay fever. Ephedra contains chemicals that have powerful stimulating effects on the nervous system and heart. Because ephedra suppresses appetite and burns fat, it was frequently used as a weight-loss supplement. The supplement was implicated in several deaths, and, for this reason, the FDA banned its use in products in 2004.\n\n[Terrorism > *Green Tea*]\nGreen tea is a drink made from the steamed and dried leaves of the *Camellia sinensis* plant, a shrub that is native to Asia. The Chinese have been drinking green tea for thousands of years to promote health. Green tea is used to relieve stomach problems (including vomiting and diarrhea), to prevent tooth decay, and to reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Because green tea contains cancer-fighting antioxidants, some researchers think it may protect against some cancers. Research is ongoing to understand the effects of green tea against cancer. In some people, green tea can cause allergic reactions. Because green tea contains caffeine, you should not drink more than 2 cups a day if you have an irregular heartbeat or panic attacks.\n\n[Terrorism > *Evening Primrose Oil*]\nEvening primrose oil, extracted from the seeds of the primrose plant (a tiny wildflower), is sometimes used for breast pain and the skin conditions allergic dermatitis and eczema.

Because feverfew can induce menstruation, it should not be used during pregnancy.\n\n[Terrorism > *Evening Primrose Oil* > *Garlic*]\nThe cloves of the garlic plant are thought to have antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal effects. These immune-boosting effects may also help prevent some cancers. People use garlic to treat a variety of conditions including colds and other upper respiratory infections. Garlic contains an ingredient that has been shown to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels, help prevent blood clots, and possibly help lower blood pressure.\n\nThe only known side effects of garlic are allergic reactions in some people, stomach upset, and bad breath. You should not use garlic with anticoagulating medications such as warfarin or aspirin (because it can increase bleeding) or if you are breastfeeding (because it can alter the taste of breast milk and possibly cause colic in your infant).\n\n[Terrorism > *Evening Primrose Oil* > *Ginger*]\nGinger ingested as a powder or in liquids is taken to prevent motion sickness and to relieve nausea and vomiting, including that caused by chemotherapy, pregnancy, or anesthesia.

While the practice dates back thousands of years, the modern form of aromatherapy was developed in France in the 1920s by a physician and a chemist. Today many French doctors incorporate essential oils in their treatment plans for patients. Essential oils are extracted and distilled from the leaves, flowers, twigs, and roots of plants such as eucalyptus, geranium, rose, and lavender. The oils are then used in massages, baths, compresses, or salves. They may also be applied to the skin in creams, inhaled in steam, or dispersed into the air using an air pump, candle, or water spray.\n\nOdors can affect the limbic system of the brain (which governs emotions), and it is thought that aromatherapy exerts its effects in this way. Therapeutic claims for aromatherapy include improvement in mood, skin conditions, fatigue, joint problems, and pain. Such claims have not been studied or verified by medical research. Aromatherapy is not meant to be used as a substitute for medical care, but as a way to promote relaxation and relieve stress.\n\n[Terrorism > Aromatherapy > *Valerian*]\nValerian is a herb that is widely used in Europe as a sleeping aid. It seems to have few side effects but in rare cases can cause headaches, heart palpitations, and insomnia. Valerian should not be used with barbiturates because it intensifies their sedative effects.\n\n[Terrorism > Manipulative Therapies]\nManipulative therapies attempt to treat illness by manipulating or moving parts of the body. Manipulative therapies include chiropractic, massage therapy, and reflexology.\n\nOsteopathic medicine is included in this section, even though it is part of mainstream medical practice, because of its emphasis on the study and treatment of the musculoskeletal system through manipulation. Chiropractic focuses on the relationship between the structure of the body (primarily the spine) and how the body works. It is based on the belief that health can be restored through manipulation of the spine. Massage therapists manipulate the soft tissues of the body to relieve so-called restrictions (tightenings) and return the tissues to normal function.\n\nManipulative therapies have had varying degrees of success at treating chronic diseases, but are generally recognized as being effective for the treatment of lower back problems and pain.\n\n[Terrorism > Manipulative Therapies > *Chiropractic*]\nChiropractic is a system of therapy based on the theory that disease results from a lack of normal nerve function. Treatment focuses on the physical adjustment and manipulation of the muscle, tissue, and joints of the spinal column instead of using medication or surgery. To diagnose a medical problem, chiropractors usually take a health history, order X-rays of the spine, and perform a physical examination of the back. Once a diagnosis is made, the chiropractor then manually adjusts the vertebrae of the spine suspected of causing the problem. The number of treatments needed and the length of visits vary.\n\nChiropractic seeks to bring the skeletal structure into balance to restore or increase the range of motion of the spinal column. It can be effective in treating lower back problems, but claims that it can also treat such medical problems as high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes have not been proven scientifically.\n\n[Terrorism > Manipulative Therapies > *Osteopathic Medicine*]\nOsteopathic medicine is similar to conventional medical practice, with an emphasis on the study of the musculoskeletal system (bones, muscles, tendons, tissues, nerves, and the spinal column). Osteopathic medicine takes a holistic approach to health care, teaching that the human body is a unified system and that the musculoskeletal system plays a central role in a person's overall health.\n\nA doctor of osteopathy (DO) is a fully trained and licensed physician who has attended a 4-year osteopathic medical school and served a 1-year internship and a 2- to 6-year residency in a specialty area, as medical doctors (MDs) do. An osteopath can\n\nprescribe drugs and is qualified to practice all branches of medicine and surgery. Osteopaths use manipulation techniques such as stretching and thrusting in addition to conventional drugs and therapies to treat illness.\n\n[Terrorism > Manipulative Therapies > *Craniosacral therapy*]\nCraniosacral therapy is a form of osteopathic manipulation that involves gentle manual manipulation of the cranial (skull) bones to relieve tightening of the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord. Osteopaths think that relieving this tightening (which they call restriction) allows the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes these structures to flow smoothly, thereby correcting the neurologic dysfunction.

The most common forms of alternative mind-body therapies are guided imagery, meditation, prayer, yoga, and art and music therapy. Relaxation therapy, another popular mind-body technique, is discussed on page 59. Hypnosis and biofeedback are not included in this section because they are now generally accepted by the medical profession. Another mind-body technique that has become an accepted part of mainstream medical practice is cognitive-behavioral therapy (see page 710).\n\nMind-body therapies have been shown to provide many health benefits, including relieving stress, understanding illness, and restoring a person's sense of control.\n\n[Terrorism > **Mind-Body Therapies** > *Guided Imagery*]\nGuided imagery refers to the use of the imagination to produce positive images that may bring about healing changes in the body. The process is often guided by the voice of a practitioner or by a voice recording that leads the person to visualize a suggested relaxing or healing scenario (such as being on a beach) in which healing can begin. The theory behind guided imagery is that the body will react as if the positive image is real, and undergo healthful changes. Guided imagery is used in hospitals and other health\n\ncare settings for its proven benefit in managing pain, reducing anxiety, and strengthening the immune system.\n\n[Terrorism > **Mind-Body Therapies** > *Meditation*]\nMeditation is a technique in which a person rests or sits quietly, usually with his or her eyes closed, and performs mental exercises that help focus attention, achieve relaxation, and increase mental awareness. The person often reaches this state by silently focusing on his or her breathing or on a word or an object. The stillness of mind and deep relaxation achieved during meditation help relieve stress and can have a beneficial effect on many medical conditions, including high blood pressure and heart disease. Meditation is also used to help relieve chronic pain, headaches, and respiratory problems such as asthma.\n\n[Terrorism > **Mind-Body Therapies** > *Prayer*]\nSeveral scientific studies have shown that prayer may have an objective and positive effect on health outcomes. In these studies, the health of people who were prayed for improved substantially more than that of people who were not prayed for. This outcome occurred whether or not the person who was ill knew about the praying or believed in the power of prayer. Medical science cannot explain the connection between prayer and healing. However, many doctors encourage it because it can strengthen an ill person's emotional and psychological well-being and give encouragement to caregivers and loved ones.\n\n[Terrorism > **Mind-Body Therapies** > **Yoga**]\nYoga is a good way to increase your joint flexibility and muscle tone while learning to relax and counteract stress.\n\n![A black and white photograph of a woman sitting cross-legged on a yoga mat indoors, performing a seated meditation posture (Padmasana or similar). She is wearing a dark long-sleeved top and dark pants, with her eyes closed.]()![](_page_217_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[Terrorism > *Yoga*]\nYoga is a discipline developed in India over thousands of years that teaches a series of body postures and movements, breathing techniques, and meditation to calm the mind and relax the body. The goal of practitioners is to reach a state of harmony between the mind and the body that leads to spiritual enlightenment. This state of harmony is also believed to produce optimal health.\n\nThe physical benefits of yoga include increased flexibility, better balance, and stronger muscles. Yoga has been shown to reduce blood pressure, breathing rate, and anxiety. Yoga is also helpful for fighting insomnia, increasing range of motion in the joints, and decreasing pain in people with osteoarthritis (see page 996) or carpal tunnel syndrome (see page 699). The sustained focus of attention that yoga requires may help improve the mental abilities of older people.\n\nYoga postures should be learned from a practitioner and then practiced at home. If you are pregnant or have a chronic disorder such as high blood pressure, you may have to modify or avoid certain postures.\n\n[Terrorism > *Art Therapy, Music Therapy, and Dance Therapy*]\nSometimes doctors use art, music, and dance to treat emotional and physical problems in a way that complements more conventional drug and therapy treatments. Art, music, and dance therapies attempt to release the healing potential of the creative arts. These therapies are frequently used in hospitals, nursing homes, psychiatric facilities, and hospices to ease pain, promote relaxation, and treat depression.

Each area of the brain is responsible for different functions, such as language, vision, movement, or emotions. The peripheral nervous system consists of nerves that radiate from the brain and spinal cord to all parts of the body.

For example, after taking a health history and performing a physical examination on a person who has a chronic cough, a doctor may recommend a chest X-ray to determine the cause of the cough. For a person who may have had a stroke, a doctor might recommend computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the brain. These procedures can often find the cause of symptoms or narrow down the possible causes. In many imaging techniques (such as angiography), contrast mediums (dyes) or contrast agents (such as air or water) are used to make specific parts of the body easier to see.\n\nX-rays, discovered in 1895, were the first imaging technique used for diagnosing medical problems. Ultrasound, which was developed in 1952 to evaluate fetuses and\n\nmonitor pregnancies, uses sound waves to create an image. Diagnostic imaging advanced significantly in the 1960s with SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography), in the 1970s with the introduction of conventional CT scans, in the 1980s with MRI and PET (positron emission tomography), and in the 1990s with functional MRI (fMRI). New imaging techniques continue to be developed.\n\nUsing viewing devices called endoscopes, which are inserted directly into the body, doctors can see inside the body to evaluate tissues and organs and to perform procedures.\n\n[Terrorism > Imaging the Brain]\nWith computerized imaging techniques such as MRIs and PET scans, doctors can look inside the living, thinking brain. These newer imaging techniques have improved the ability of doctors to diagnose and locate the site of brain disorders. The techniques have also enabled them to understand the relationship between different areas of the brain, to learn about the functions of specific areas of the brain, and to develop new treatments for brain disorders.\n\n[Terrorism > Imaging the Brain > Brains of aggressive and nonaggressive teens]\nFor these images, a technique called functional MRI (fMRI) shows brain activity (orange areas at top of images) in teens who have disruptive behavior disorder (which makes them aggressive) and in healthy, nonaggressive teens as they play a violent video game. The images show less activity in the frontal lobe of a teen with the behavior disorder (left) than in the frontal lobe of the healthy teen (right), indicating that the teen with the disorder is less able to inhibit the violent emotions triggered by the video game.\n\n![Functional MRI scan showing brain activity (orange areas) in the frontal lobe of a teen with disruptive behavior disorder (left image).]()![](_page_236_Picture_6.jpeg)\n\nBrain of an aggressive teen\n\n![Functional MRI scan showing brain activity (orange areas) in the frontal lobe of a healthy, nonaggressive teen (right image).]()![](_page_236_Picture_8.jpeg)\n\nBrain of a nonaggressive teen\n\n[Terrorism > Brain hemorrhage]\nThis three-dimensional angiogram shows a brain after a type of stroke caused by a hemorrhage, or bleeding inside the brain.

Angiograms can help doctors diagnose blood vessel disorders and are frequently performed before surgery on a blood vessel to locate the sites of blockages or other problems. Before an angiogram, a contrast medium (dye) containing iodine (which shows up on X-rays) is injected through a thin, flexible tube (catheter) inserted through a small incision into the femoral artery in the groin, the brachial artery in the elbow, or one of the carotid arteries in the neck. A rapid series of X-ray pictures is then taken of the arteries. Any abnormalities in the arteries will show up on the X-rays.\n\nMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA) uses MRI (page 113) with angiography. In MRA, specific radio-pulse sequences are used (usually without using X-rays and usually without injecting a contrast medium) to create and enhance images.\n\n[Terrorism > THE PROCEDURE]\nIf you are having an angiogram, you will be asked to lie very still on an examining table. The area in which the catheter is inserted will be numbed with an anesthetic. A needle is inserted through the skin into the artery, and a long, thin wire with a soft tip is inserted through the needle. The needle is then removed and the catheter threaded over the wire into the blood vessel. When the contrast medium is injected, you will feel a sensation of warmth for a few seconds. The procedure lasts from a few minutes to a few hours. After the examination, you may be asked to lie still for a few hours. Angiography poses a slight risk of damage to blood vessels (at the site of the injection or anywhere along the blood vessel during passage of the catheter) and a risk of an allergic reaction to the contrast medium.\n\n[Terrorism > THE PROCEDURE > Aneurysm in a carotid artery]\nThis angiogram reveals an aneurysm, an abnormal ballooning of a weakened area in the wall of an artery (red area on left), as viewed from the back of the head.

Although ultrasound was initially used to view fetuses, it is now used to examine every organ of the body, including the heart (an echocardiogram). Because ultrasound does not pose a risk of exposure to radiation, it is increasingly taking the place of conventional X-rays (see page 109) for diagnosing many different conditions. In ultrasound, sound waves are directed into the body through a wandlike device called a transducer, which is moved around the skin over the area to be examined. Ultrasound produces clear images of soft tissues and fluid-filled organs (such as the ovaries) but is less useful for examining organs filled with gas or air (such as the lungs). Also, ultrasound waves do not penetrate bone. The ultrasound images are displayed on a computer screen. Ultrasound is often used to guide the positioning of a needle during a biopsy (removal ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Angiography", "relation": "is used to examine", "tail": "blood vessels"}, {"head": "angiograms", "relation": "help doctors diagnose", "tail": "blood vessel disorders"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "contrast medium", "relation": "is injected through", "tail": "[Event: a thin, flexible tube (catheter) inserted through a small incision into the femoral artery in the groin]"}, {"head": "X-ray pictures", "relation": "are taken of", "tail": "[Event: the arteries]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: an angiogram is performed]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: doctors diagnose blood vessel disorders]"}, {"head": "[Event: a contrast medium is injected through a catheter]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: X-ray pictures are taken of the arteries]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Using these techniques, a doctor can examine the structure and appearance of internal organs. Like computed tomography (CT) scanning (see previous page), MRI uses a computer to construct images from information recorded by the scanner. In MRI, however, the information is not provided by X-rays. Instead, the person being examined is placed inside a powerful magnet, which arranges the nuclei of some of the hydrogen atoms in the body in a precise pattern (like iron shavings around a magnet). A pulse of radio waves is then passed through the person's body, moving the nuclei of the aligned hydrogen atoms briefly out of alignment. The nuclei then return to their original pattern, emitting radio signals as they do so. Different tissues such as tumors emit a more or less intense signal. These signals are detected by the machine and analyzed by the computer. The information is then used by the computer to construct an image. MRI can sometimes produce more detailed three-dimensional images than CT.\n\nMRI technology includes magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). MRA, like other types of angiography (see page 110), is used to evaluate blood flow but does not use dyes or radioactive tracers. MRS is different from conventional MRI in that MRS uses a continuous band of radio waves to excite hydrogen atoms in a variety of chemical compounds other than water. The compounds absorb and emit radio energy at certain frequencies (or spectra) that can be used to identify them. A color image is created by assigning a color to each distinct spectral emission. MRS is used to produce color images of brain function and to identify the chemical composition of diseased tissue.\n\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)—also called brain mapping—uses the same MRI scanner hardware to provide noninvasive images of the brain's activity, and to detect changes resulting from biological function. Functional MRI tracks blood flow in the brain. The more active an area of the brain is, the more blood flows to it. Functional MRI enables doctors to take a series of images in quick succession and to analyze the differences between them. It also allows doctors to identify the parts of the\n\nbrain that “light up” (are active) when a person is asked to perform specific tasks or is exposed to certain stimuli.\n\n[Terrorism > THE PROCEDURE]\nBecause the MRI scanner creates a very strong magnetic field, you cannot carry or wear any metal objects (such as jewelry, eyeglasses, or hair clips) during the examination. Make sure you let your doctor know if you have any metal implants (such as artificial joints, plates, screws, or clips), metal attachments (such as dental braces), or electrical devices (such as a hearing aid), which could be affected by the magnet. It is especially important to tell your doctor if you have a pacemaker because the magnet can make the pacemaker stop working. Although MRI is not known to pose any health risks to a fetus, tell your doctor before having the procedure if you are (or could be) pregnant.\n\n[Terrorism > THE PROCEDURE > Prostate cancer]\nThis MRI scan of a male pelvis shows an enlarged prostate gland (dark brown) with a cancerous tumor (black kidney-shaped area).

Because the scanner is very noisy, you are given earplugs or headphones to help block the noise. You may be given a contrast medium through a needle inserted into a vein. You must lie still during the MRI, and you may be asked to hold your breath occasionally. In closed MRI, the table slides into a narrow tunnel inside the scanner. In open MRI, the scanner is quieter and less confining.

After the radioactive tracer is swallowed or injected, you may need to wait for it to travel through your bloodstream and collect in the target organ before you are examined by the gamma camera. Because this may take several hours, you may be allowed to leave the facility and return later to take the scan. While you are having the scan, you lie or sit on the examination table, and the gamma camera is moved close to the area being examined. You must stay very still during the scan, but you may be asked to change positions; the technician will reposition you and the camera if necessary. The amount of time the procedure takes varies from about 1 to 5 hours. In some cases, a second or third scan is required. Radionuclide scanning is painless (except for the injection of the tracer).

Although genes play a role in all diseases, lifestyle factors—such as exercise habits and diet—are even more important influences on your health risks. Your doctor can help you evaluate your health risks and recommend steps to take to reduce them. See your doctor regularly to make sure you have all the recommended checkups, screening tests, and vaccinations. In general, the earlier a disorder is diagnosed and treated, the better the outcome.\n\n[Terrorism > Routine Health Care]\nYou may need to choose a new doctor for a number of reasons: a move to another community, your doctor's retirement or relocation, new health insurance requirements, the need for a specialist, a problem with your current doctor, or to get a second opinion. Try to explore your options while you are well so that you don't have to rush into a decision during a crisis. Get a copy of your medical records from your former doctor or ask his or her office to send them to your new doctor. Everyone wants his or her doctor to be well trained, competent, and accessible. Compassion and high ethical standards are also important qualities in a doctor and are basic to good health care.\n\n[Terrorism > How to Choose a Doctor]\nIf you are in a health insurance plan, or if you need a doctor who will accept Medicare, the range of doctors you can choose from may be restricted. With this in mind, ask friends and relatives if they have had good experiences with their doctors. What do they like about their doctors? (Remember, however, that what they like about their doctors may not be the same qualities you are looking for.) Ask your current doctor or other health care professionals for recommendations. Find out from local medical societies which doctors are currently accepting new patients. Locate a medical center that\n\nspecializes in a particular area of health you're interested in, and ask your doctor for a referral to the center or call the center yourself and find out how to get an appointment.\n\nMany organizations (such as hospitals) have no-fee physician-referral services. You can also get information from doctor-selection services online or over the telephone. Most of these services organize their information according to type of practice and location. Others also provide information about a doctor's background, education, training, and professional achievements.\n\n[Terrorism > Doctor Finder]\nYou can locate doctors in your area by specialty through a physician-referral service called Doctor Finder, or AMA Physician Select, from the American Medical Association ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "chalazion", "relation": "caused by", "tail": "blockage of the glands"}, {"head": "chalazion", "relation": "can become infected", "tail": "infection"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: eye inflammation]"}, {"head": "[Event: entropion]", "relation": "can cause", "tail": "[Event: extreme discomfort and eye inflammation]"}]}, "status": "success"}

They may need to take several different prescription and nonprescription medications every day, and can easily become confused about what medication to take at what time. Some older people may accidentally skip doses or take extra doses, while others may have trouble swallowing their medication. All of these problems can present serious health risks.\n\nThe following tips can help an older person or his or her caregiver manage medications safely:\n\n- Make a list of the medications (both prescription and over-the-counter) the person is taking, and keep it up-to-date. Bring the list (or the containers) along to each office visit. This information helps the doctor prescribe and properly monitor the person's medications.\n- Tell the doctor promptly about any side effects or changes in the way the drug affects the person.\n- If the person has trouble remembering to take medication, try associating doses with specific times of the day—such as first thing in the morning, at bedtime, or with meals.\n- Keep a medication schedule on a calendar, and check off each dose as the person takes it.\n- Use a divided container to sort the person's doses of medication for the week. Plastic containers designed for this purpose are available at drugstores. Make sure that the container is labeled correctly.\n- Have the person take his or her medications exactly as prescribed. Never change the dosage or stop any prescribed medication unless the doctor tells you to do so.\n- Ask the doctor to prescribe medication in the form that is easiest for the person to take. For example, if the person has problems swallowing pills, the medication may be available in liquid form.\n- Encourage the person to take medication when sitting or standing rather than when lying down.\n\n- If the person has trouble opening containers, ask the pharmacist to use containers with easy-to-open lids. Always keep the containers out of the reach of children.\n- Make sure that the instructions on the labels can be read and understood. Request that medication labels be printed in large type.\n- Avoid keeping medications on a bedside table. This helps to prevent the person from taking the wrong drug or overdosing when he or she is not fully awake.\n- Keep the person's prescriptions up-to-date. If the doctor wants the person to continue taking a medication that is nearing its expiration date, be sure to inform the doctor as soon as possible so that he or she can call the pharmacist to renew the prescription or write a new one.\n- Dispose of all unused and expired prescription medications and over-the-counter medications. Throw them away.\n- Make sure that the person never takes any medication that was prescribed for someone else, and never gives his or her medication to anyone else.", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "medications", "relation": "treats", "tail": "health risks"}, {"head": "medication", "relation": "causes", "tail": "serious health risks"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "older person", "relation": "participates in", "tail": "[Event: managing medications]"}, {"head": "caregiver", "relation": "manages", "tail": "[Event: medication management]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

When you are familiar with your body, you are more likely to notice any abnormal changes. Regular self-examinations—especially of the breasts, skin, and testicles—provide the best chance of detecting a tumor at an early stage, when it is small, easier to treat, and usually has a better chance for a cure.\n\n[Terrorism > Self-Examinations > Breast Self-Examination]\nEarly detection of breast cancer improves the chances for a cure. Many breast lumps are found by women themselves during regular breast self-examinations. All women should start examining their breasts for changes each month at age 18 and continue performing regular exams throughout their life. Any changes in the shape or feel of your breasts or changes in the skin or nipples can be early signs of breast cancer. Look for hard or soft lumps, changes in skin texture (such as scaling) or color (such as redness), puckering or depression (such as dimpling) in part of the breast, a newly inverted nipple, or a discharge of any kind from a nipple. Each woman's breasts are unique, so it's important to get to know your breasts to be able to tell what's normal for you.\n\nPerform a breast self-examination every month at the same time in your menstrual cycle. The best time to do a self-exam is right after your menstrual period ends (about 7 to 10 days after your period starts), when your breasts are less tender or swollen. If you take oral contraceptives, do the self-exam when you start a new pill pack each month. If you are on hormone therapy (see page 853), ask your doctor about the best time to perform a breast self-examination. After menopause, choose a specific day of the month and perform the exam on that day each month.\n\nIf you detect anything unusual in a breast, let your doctor know right away. Although most breast lumps and other changes are not cancerous, they all should be evaluated by a doctor.\n\n[Terrorism > Self-Examinations > Percentage of cancerous tumors]\nBreast cancer is more likely to occur in some parts of the breast than in others. Most breast tumors occur in the upper, outer part of the breast (toward the armpit) or behind the nipple. Examine all parts of your breasts, but pay special attention to these areas. The percentage of cancerous tumors that are found in each part of the breast are shown here.\n\n![Diagram of a woman's breast showing the percentage of cancerous tumors found in different parts of the breast.

Some screening tests, such as the fecal occult blood test, are recommended for everybody after a certain age, while other tests are recommended for women or men specifically. For example, the Pap smear is recommended for women (to detect cervical cancer) and the PSA test is recommended for men (to detect prostate cancer).\n\n[Terrorism > Common Examinations and Tests > Pelvic Examination and Pap Smear]\nA pelvic examination is often performed as part of a routine gynecologic checkup. During the examination, you lie on your back on an examining table with your feet in stirrups and your knees apart and bent. The doctor will insert an instrument called a speculum into your vagina to hold it open while he or she checks for any abnormalities in the walls of your vagina and cervix (the opening into the uterus).\n\nIn a procedure called a Pap smear, the doctor swabs a few cells from the cervix to send to a laboratory, where they are examined for abnormal changes that could become cancerous. After taking the sample cells, the doctor will remove the speculum and insert one or two gloved fingers into your vagina to check for abnormalities in the uterus, ovaries, or fallopian tubes. Your doctor may examine your rectum as well at this time and take a sample of stool for laboratory testing.\n\nThe results of your Pap test usually come back in a few weeks. The test result is negative if the cells are normal; the result is positive if the cells are precancerous or cancerous. If the results indicate cancerous or precancerous cells, your doctor will\n\narrange for further tests and treatment. If the results are inconclusive—referred to as ASCUS (for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance)—the test may have to be repeated every 3 months until definite results come back or until the doctor performs a colposcopy (see page 874) to examine the cervix directly.\n\n[Terrorism > Common Examinations and Tests > The pelvic examination]\nDuring a pelvic examination, a doctor examines the pelvic organs by hand to feel for any abnormalities of the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes.\n\n![Diagram illustrating a pelvic examination. Hands are shown palpating the internal female reproductive organs. Labeled structures include the Fallopian tube, Ovary, Uterus, Vagina, Rectum, and Cervix.]()![](_page_311_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\nMany laboratories perform genetic tests on Pap smears to identify specific strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV) that are known to increase a woman's risk of cervical cancer. If the results of your Pap smear show that you have been exposed to a cancer-causing strain of HPV, your doctor may recommend that you have more frequent Pap smears or a colposcopy.\n\nYou should have your first Pap smear when you are planning to become sexually active or by age 18. To help prevent cervical cancer, see your doctor regularly—every year or as often as your doctor recommends—for a Pap smear, which makes early detection of cervical dysplasia (see page 874) possible. A Pap smear can help prevent cancer by detecting highly treatable precancerous changes in the cervical cells, which can then be destroyed at an early stage.\n\n[Terrorism > Common Examinations and Tests > Mammograms]\nA mammogram is a low-intensity X-ray that provides a picture of the internal structure of the breast. Digital mammography records the X-rays in computer code rather than on X-ray film. Mammograms are used as a screening test for breast cancer in women over 40 to detect cancers at an early stage, when they are generally easier to treat and more likely to be cured. Diagnostic mammograms are used to evaluate breast changes such as lumps, pain, or nipple discharge and to look more closely at abnormalities found on a screening mammogram. Although lung cancer kills more women each year, breast cancer is the most common cancer in American women, especially those between ages 50 and 69.\n\nMost doctors recommend that women have a baseline screening mammogram at about age 40 and then have mammograms every 1 to 2 years. For women who are at increased risk of breast cancer (see page 857)—such as those who have a family history of breast cancer (especially in a mother or sister)—a doctor may recommend starting regular mammograms at a younger age. You can obtain a high-quality mammogram at a breast clinic, the radiology department of a hospital, a private radiology office, or at a doctor's office.\n\n[Terrorism > Common Examinations and Tests > **Detecting breast tumors early**]\nIn general, the earlier breast cancer is detected and treated, the higher the chances for a cure.

During a digital rectal examination, a doctor inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum and may use the other hand to press on the lower abdomen or pelvic area. A digital rectal exam is frequently done as part of a routine physical examination in men and a routine pelvic examination in women, or to find the cause of symptoms such as pelvic pain or rectal bleeding. During the exam, the doctor usually takes a sample of stool from the rectum to test it for blood, which can be an early sign of colon cancer. In men, a doctor can feel the prostate during a digital rectal examination; in women, the doctor can feel the uterus and ovaries to check for abnormalities. Other organs, such as the bladder, can sometimes also be felt during a digital rectal examination.\n\n[Terrorism > Sigmoidoscopy]\nFlexible sigmoidoscopy is used as a screening test for cancer in the lower part of the large intestine (the sigmoid or descending colon), which runs from the rectum through the last section of the colon. Sigmoidoscopy is also used to find the cause of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and constipation, or to diagnose and monitor conditions such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. For the procedure, a doctor inserts a short, flexible, lighted viewing tube (sigmoidoscope) into the rectum and slowly guides it into the lower colon. As the doctor withdraws the tube, he or she looks through it, carefully examining the rectum and colon.\n\nIf the doctor finds anything unusual, such as an abnormal growth (polyp) or inflamed tissue, he or she will remove a small sample of tissue (biopsy), using instruments inserted through the scope. The tissue sample is sent to a laboratory for examination under a microscope. If you have polyps, which can sometimes become cancerous, your doctor will recommend that you have a colonoscopy (see page 767), which allows the doctor to examine the entire colon.\n\nBefore having a sigmoidoscopy, you will be given instructions about emptying your intestine. For example, your doctor may recommend that you have one or two enemas before the procedure, and you may be asked to use a laxative or to modify your diet in some way. For the procedure, you lie on your side on an examining table while the doctor inserts the flexible tube (about the thickness of a finger) into your anus and rectum and slowly directs it up through the lower colon. You may feel some discomfort, such as pressure and slight cramping in your lower abdomen. The procedure takes about 5 to 10 minutes.\n\n[Terrorism > Blood Tests]\nDoctors order blood tests for a number of reasons. By taking a sample of blood and having it evaluated in a laboratory, a doctor can learn if you are susceptible to developing a particular disorder or can determine the cause of an existing disorder and how to treat it. Many factors, such as taking prescription or nonprescription medications, drinking alcohol, or eating before the test, can affect the test results. You will be given instructions on how to prepare for a blood test.\n\n[Terrorism > Blood Tests > *Complete Blood Cell Count*]\nA doctor takes a complete blood cell (CBC) count to check the quantity and quality of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets—three major types of cells in the blood. A CBC count consists of six different tests.\n\n[Terrorism > Blood Tests > *Complete Blood Cell Count* > Red blood cell count]\nThe red blood cell (RBC) count is used to determine if the level of red cells (which transport oxygen to tissues) in the blood is too high or too low. Extremely high levels of red blood cells may be a sign of a blood disorder such as polycythemia; extremely low levels may be a sign of anemia.\n\n[Terrorism > Blood Tests > Routine Vaccinations for Adults]\nIn addition to periodic health checkups and screening tests, your doctor will probably recommend that you have vaccinations against some potentially dangerous infectious diseases.

Increased levels of triglycerides or LDL cholesterol and decreased levels of HDL cholesterol can indicate an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart disease, atherosclerosis, and stroke. Doctors use the cholesterol test to evaluate heart disease risk. Drugs such as corticosteroids, thiazide diuretics, and oral contraceptives can affect cholesterol levels. Excess alcohol intake, kidney and liver diseases, obesity, menopause, diabetes, and hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland) also can affect cholesterol and lipid levels.\n\n[Terrorism > Glucose]\nGlucose is a sugar that the body uses for energy. The hormone insulin, which is produced by the pancreas, regulates the level of glucose in the blood. Increased levels of glucose can be a sign of diabetes. Decreased levels of glucose can be a sign of adrenal insufficiency (underfunctioning of the adrenal glands). Conditions such as a stroke or heart attack can temporarily increase glucose levels. Medications such as corticosteroids, diuretics, and tricyclic antidepressants also can increase glucose levels. In general, low blood glucose is a rare condition in people who are otherwise healthy. The normal glucose range is 65 to 109 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).\n\n[Terrorism > Albumin]\nThe albumin test measures the amount in the blood of the protein albumin, which keeps water inside blood vessels and is the most plentiful protein in the body. The albumin level is a good indicator of a person's general nutritional status. Disorders such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and malnutrition can cause a decrease in the level of albumin. The level of albumin is also decreased during pregnancy. The albumin test can help diagnose liver disease, kidney disease, and intestinal disorders such as Crohn's disease that can reduce the absorption of nutrients. People who have cancer or chronic diseases\n\nsuch as autoimmune disorders or AIDS often have a low albumin level. The normal albumin range is 3.7 to 5.2 grams per deciliter (g/dL).\n\n[Terrorism > Albumin > Alkaline phosphatase]\nAlkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme that is present in all tissues of the body. High concentrations of ALP are normally found in the liver, in bile ducts, in bones, and, in pregnant women, in the placenta. Extremely high levels of ALP can be a sign of several abnormal conditions, including bone disease, leukemia, and liver disease. The enzyme can also be elevated in normal conditions such as healthy bone growth or can result from an abnormal response to a medication. The normal ALP range is 40 to 157 international units per liter (IU/L).\n\n[Terrorism > Albumin > Alanine aminotransferase]\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) is an enzyme found in many tissues, but is present in high levels in the liver.

However, this test is not used as a screening test for ovarian cancer or to make a definite diagnosis of ovarian cancer because levels of CA-125 also can be elevated in noncancerous conditions such as inflammation in the abdomen, pelvic infections, uterine fibroids, ovarian cysts, endometriosis, and liver diseases such as hepatitis and cirrhosis. The CA-125 test is often used, usually along with other tests, to monitor the effectiveness of treatment of ovarian cancer in women who are undergoing chemotherapy.\n\nA CA-125 level below 35 units per milliliter (U/mL) is considered normal. If your level of CA-125 is higher than normal, your doctor will recommend further tests, such as a vaginal ultrasound (see page 510), to make a diagnosis.\n\n[Terrorism > Albumin > *Thyroid Hormones*]\nThe thyroid gland produces two thyroid hormones, called thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which can be measured in the blood to help doctors evaluate thyroid function. The thyroid's hormone production is triggered by secretion of a hormone called thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) by the pituitary gland in the brain. Doctors usually use a combination of two or more tests to diagnose thyroid disorders. For example, a high level of TSH and a low level of T4 can indicate an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). An abnormally low level of TSH and high level of T4 can indicate an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). The normal range for total\n\nT4 is 4.6 to 12 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL). The normal range for total T3 is 80 to 180 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL). The normal range for TSH is 0.5 to 6 microunits per milliliter (mcU/mL).\n\n[Terrorism > Urine Tests]\nDoctors use urine tests to evaluate urine for signs of infection in the kidneys or bladder, or for the presence of blood or other substances. A person may have a urine test for a number of reasons, including as part of an annual physical examination, before surgery, to diagnose a urinary tract infection, and to confirm and monitor a pregnancy. A urine sample can be taken at the doctor's office or at home (and brought to the doctor's office).\n\nIt is essential for urine samples to be taken under clean conditions. Before having a urine test, you will be asked to wash your genital area to make sure that the urine is not contaminated by bacteria that normally live on the skin. You will be given a clean container in which to urinate. To get a midstream or clean-catch urine sample, you will be asked to urinate into the toilet for a few seconds before urinating into the container.\n\n[Terrorism > Urine Tests > *Urinealysis*]\nA doctor performs a urinalysis to diagnose or monitor conditions that affect the kidneys, such as kidney disease or diabetes. The doctor will use a test strip to check for specific suspected abnormalities, such as the presence of bacteria. The sample is also examined more closely under a microscope to look for bacteria or other microorganisms and for specific substances, such as mucus, red blood cells, or white blood cells that can be signs of health problems.\n\n[Terrorism > Urine Tests > *Urine Culture*]\nDoctors perform urine cultures to diagnose urinary tract infections. After the urine is collected, a sample is put on a slide in the laboratory and placed in an incubator for 24 hours. If bacteria, yeast, or other microorganisms grow on the sample, the test result is considered positive. The sample is then tested with various drugs to determine what medication to use to treat the infection.\n\n[Terrorism > First Aid]\nThe main goal of first aid is to help an injured (or, in some cases, ill) person recover or to prevent an injury from getting worse. The person giving first aid should also provide reassurance and make the person as comfortable as possible until professional help arrives. For many minor injuries, first aid may be all that is needed. More serious injuries may require medical attention and further treatment.\n\nThe more knowledge you have before an injury or emergency occurs, the more helpful you can be. Review this section and familiarize yourself with first-aid techniques and procedures. Some topics such as allergic reactions (see page 912), asthma attacks (see page 640), seizures (see page 686), and diabetic coma (see page 897) are covered in other sections of the book. Sports injuries and the standard treatment for most athletic injuries are covered on pages 978 to 982.\n\nMake a practice run to the nearest hospital emergency department so you know the best route in case you have to drive an injured person there yourself.

AEDs are increasingly being made available in public places such as airports, schools, and shopping malls. They are intended for use by nonmedical personnel and can be used by anyone without prior training (although AED classes are\n\navailable in most communities). The devices come with written and audio instructions. An AED is easier to use and more effective than cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\n\nThe AED first checks the person's heart rhythm to determine if a shock is needed. The AED will not administer a shock unless the person needs it. In addition, the AED will work even if the pads aren't placed in the exact position. Always ask if an AED is available if you think someone may be having or may have had a heart attack.\n\nSymptoms of a heart attack include constant pain (which may last several minutes) or a sensation of tightness or pressure in the center of the chest; chest pain or discomfort that moves from the chest to an arm or shoulder or to the neck, jaw, back, or abdomen; profuse sweating; nausea or vomiting; anxiety; pale skin or bluish nails or lips; weakness; dizziness; and difficulty breathing.\n\n**If you think someone may be having a heart attack:**\n\n1. Call or have someone call 911 or your local emergency number, or send someone for help. Tell emergency personnel that the person may be having a heart attack.\n2. Find out if there is an automated external defibrillator (AED) available where you are. Take the person immediately to the nearest hospital emergency department after following steps 3, 4, or 5 below.\n3. *If the person is conscious*, help the person into a comfortable sitting position (lying down may make breathing difficult) and (if the person is not allergic to aspirin) give him or her an aspirin. Chewable aspirin is best, but you can have him or her chew a regular aspirin. Don't give him or her anything else to eat or drink. Loosen any tight clothing and keep the person calm, comfortable, and warm.\n4. *If the person is unconscious and not breathing and an AED is not available*, start CPR if you have had CPR training. Start mouth-to-mouth resuscitation immediately (see page 156) until breathing has been restored or until medical help arrives.\n5. *If the person is unconscious and not breathing and an AED is available*, open the person's clothing and place the electrode pads on the person's chest as directed on the machine—one pad on the person's upper right side (between the nipple and collarbone) and the other pad on the person's lower left side (just below the armpit). Make sure no one (including the person administering the defibrillator) is touching the person. Press the “analyze” button on the machine,\n\nwhich checks to see if a shock should be administered. If the defibrillator says to give the person a shock, again make sure no one is touching the person, and press the “shock” button. Repeat this sequence (of pressing the analyze and shock buttons) up to three times if necessary. If there is still no pulse, start CPR if you have had CPR training.\n\n[Terrorism > Unconsciousness]\nWhen a person is unconscious, the body's normal reflexes are not functioning. The person will not respond to attempts to rouse him or her. The main danger when a person is unconscious is obstruction of the airway, which can result when the tongue or some other object such as food or vomit blocks the airway. Some causes of unconsciousness include heart attack (see previous page), stroke (see page 669), head injury (see page 167), severe bleeding (see next page), severe burn (see page 163, diabetic coma (hypoglycemia; see page 897), broken bones (see page 167), poisoning (see page 169), drug overdose, heatstroke (see page 166), choking (see page 155), a severe allergic reaction to food or to an insect bite or sting (see page 170), snakebite (see page 172), and an electric shock or lightning strike (see page 163).\n\nCall or have someone call 911 or your local emergency number, or send someone for help. If you can't call or send for help, take the person immediately to the nearest hospital emergency department. Do not leave an unconscious person alone.\n\n[Terrorism > How to Treat a Person Who Is Unconscious]\n*If the person is not breathing:*\n\n1.

Do not remove any object that is embedded in the wound.\n2. Using the palm of your hand, press firmly over the site of the wound, using a clean pad or piece of clothing.\n3. If the wound is not a sucking wound (see page 159), cover the entire wound and about 2 inches around it with a petroleum gauze dressing, large cloth, sheet of foil, or plastic wrap. Try to make the dressing airtight using tape or another\n\nadhesive. If you don't have tape, place a hand on each side of the wound and firmly push the skin together to close the wound.\n\n1. If the wound seems to be sucking in air, seal the wound after the person has exhaled, but leave one corner untaped, which will prevent air from being trapped in the chest cavity and pressing on the collapsed lung.\n2. Lay the person down with the head and shoulders raised and the body leaning slightly toward the injured side.\n3. Don't give the person anything to eat or drink.\n\n[Terrorism > Shock]\nShock is a life-threatening reduction in the flow of blood to body tissues. Shock usually results from a serious illness or injury, such as a heart attack (see page 157), spinal injury (see page 167), severe bleeding (see page 159), severe burn (see next page), poisoning (see page 169), or a severe allergic reaction (see page 916).\n\nA person who is in shock looks pale and sweaty; has cool, moist skin and a weak, rapid pulse; and acts confused.

New skin forms under a blister, and the fluid inside the blister is gradually absorbed; eventually the outer skin layer comes off. First aid is needed only if the blister breaks or if the raw skin area is likely to be damaged by friction, which can lead to pain and infection.\n\n[Terrorism > Elevate a burned arm, leg, hand, or foot > Blisters > **To treat a blister:**]\n1. Gently wash the blister and surrounding area with soap and water. Do not prick the blister or try to remove it.\n2. Cover the blister with a sterile gauze pad and tape the pad in place.\n3. If the blister was caused by a chemical, is larger than 2 inches across, or occurs on the hands, face (especially around the mouth and nose), or genitals, see your doctor.\n\n[Terrorism > **Hypothermia**]\nHypothermia is a drop in internal body temperature below 95°F. Hypothermia usually occurs from prolonged exposure to extreme cold or after submersion in cold water, although it can occur in relatively warm water if the water temperature is lower than body temperature and exposure is long enough. During prolonged exposure to extreme cold, more body heat is lost than can be replaced, and body temperature drops. In young, healthy people, hypothermia occurs only after extreme, prolonged exposure. In older people and very young children, hypothermia occurs faster and more easily.\n\nThe drop in body temperature may not be noticeable at first but can cause clumsiness, irritability, slurred speech, confusion, and drowsiness as a person's physical and mental abilities slow. Breathing and heartbeat become weaker and slower, and the person may eventually go into a coma and die.\n\n[Terrorism > **Hypothermia** > **To treat hypothermia:**]\n1. Call or have someone call 911 or your local emergency number, or send someone for help.\n2. If the person's breathing has stopped, start mouth-to-mouth resuscitation immediately (see page 156). If there is no heartbeat, perform CPR if you have had CPR training.\n3. Have the person lie down, and keep him or her as still as possible, which reduces the risk of a dangerous drop in blood pressure or heart rhythm abnormalities that can occur when cold blood returns to the heart from the extremities.\n\n1. If outside, shelter the person from the cold and wind in any way you can. Insulate him or her from the ground to prevent further heat loss. Cover him or her with warm, dry clothing and blankets, and make sure his or her head is covered. Use your own body to provide additional warmth.\n2. If you can, bring the person into a warm room. Remove any wet clothing. Do not overheat the person too quickly by placing him or her in front of a heater. Rewarming the body too quickly can cause a rush of blood to the body's surface and a drop in internal body temperature when cold blood from the arms and legs returns to the heart and brain.\n3. If the person is conscious, give him or her a warm (not hot) beverage such as broth or warm water with lemon or honey or gelatin dissolved in it. Do not give the person alcohol, beverages that contain caffeine (such as tea, coffee, or hot chocolate), or cigarettes. Alcohol can restrict blood flow to the extremities and inhibit the shivering mechanism, which helps warm the body. Caffeine accelerates the symptoms of hypothermia and can cause the heart to beat faster, possibly causing heart-rhythm abnormalities.

They are extremely harmful, and possibly fatal, if swallowed. Keep them in correctly labeled childproof containers, and store them out of the reach of children.\n\n- Antifreeze\n- Cigarettes and other forms of tobacco\n- Cosmetics, colognes, or perfumes\n- Drugs of any kind\n- Gardening products such as fertilizer, fungicide, or weed killer\n- Household cleaners such as bleach, dishwasher and dishwashing detergent, drain cleaner, furniture polish, glass cleaner, grease remover, laundry detergent, oven cleaner, scouring powder, or toilet bowl cleaner\n- Insecticides\n- Liquor\n- Nail polish and removers\n\n- Paint and paint thinner\n- Certain plants (such as dieffenbachia, philodendrons, and spider plants)\n\n[Terrorism > Poisonous Plants]\nSome plants can cause an allergic reaction or direct chemical reaction on the skin, such as a burn or a blister. Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac are three of the most common plants that cause this reaction in susceptible people. When a person touches a poisonous plant (or touches clothing or a pet that has been in contact with the plant), an oily substance on the leaves gets on the skin and can cause an itchy, oozing rash (see color illustration on page 120). The rash can be easily spread to other parts of the body. The smoke from burning poison ivy, oak, or sumac can cause skin irritation and, if inhaled, can cause severe wheezing or difficulty breathing.\n\nAn over-the-counter lotion containing bentoquatam (which blocks the irritating oil that causes the allergic reaction) can be applied before a potential exposure to prevent or reduce an allergic skin reaction. It should be applied at least 15 minutes before the possible exposure (and every 4 hours after), and the skin should be washed after exposure even if the lotion was applied. The medication will not stop or prevent a reaction if applied after exposure.\n\n[Terrorism > Poisonous Plants > To treat poison ivy, oak, or sumac:]\n1. Wear gloves if you are helping someone who has been exposed to a poisonous plant remove his or her clothing.\n2. Wash the skin and clean the fingernails immediately (within 15 minutes) with mild soap and water to remove the oily plant substance.\n3. Apply cool packs to the affected areas.\n4. Tell the person not to scratch or rub the affected areas; scratching can worsen or spread the rash.\n5. Take frequent warm (not hot) showers or oatmeal baths, apply calamine lotion or topical corticosteroids to the affected areas, and take oral antihistamines or over-the-counter pain relievers to help relieve itching.\n6. Wash clothing thoroughly, using warm water and a laundry detergent that can remove oil.\n7. If the reaction is severe or if the rash is on the person's face (especially around the eyes or mouth) or genitals, get medical attention right away.\n\n[Terrorism > Insect Stings]\nInsect stings cause more deaths per year than snakebites, but most insect stings cause only mild reactions, such as redness and swelling. Some stings can be life-threatening and cause anaphylactic shock (see page 916) if a person is allergic to the insect's venom. The most common stinging insects are honeybees, hornets, wasps, yellow jackets, bumblebees, and fire ants. Only honeybees leave a stinger in the skin.\n\nSome symptoms of insect stings are pain, swelling, redness, itching, and burning. Multiple insect stings can cause rapid swelling, headache, muscle cramps, fever, and drowsiness. Severe allergic reactions to insect stings include severe swelling and itching (including in areas of the body away from the sting), hives, coughing or wheezing, difficulty breathing, stomach cramps, nausea and vomiting, weakness, dizziness, bluish skin color, and unconsciousness.\n\n[Terrorism > Insect Stings > To treat a severe allergic reaction to an insect sting:]\n1. If the person seems to be having a severe allergic reaction, call or have someone call 911 or your local emergency number, or send someone for help. If the person has an anaphylaxis kit, help him or her administer a shot of epinephrine (adrenaline); if he or she is unable to administer the injection, give it to him or her yourself by following the instructions on the kit.\n2.

Rattlesnakes are responsible for two out of three poisonous snakebites and are found all over the United States. Cottonmouth and copperhead snakes are found primarily in the Southeast and South Central United States. Coral snakes are found in the Southeast.\n\nIt is important to know whether a snake is poisonous. Poisonous, or venomous, snakes have a triangular-shaped head, while nonvenomous snakes have a more rounded\n\nhead. Pit vipers such as the rattlesnake, copperhead, and cottonmouth have pits (which look like another set of nostrils) between their nostrils and their slitlike eyes. Rattlesnakes have a rattle at the end of their tail. Cottonmouths have a white lining in their mouth. Copperheads have a copper-colored head and a pinkish gray body with a brown hourglass shape on the skin.\n\nThe symptoms of a pit viper bite include severe pain, rapid swelling, discoloration, and redness at the site of the bite. The person may also experience weakness, nausea and vomiting, blurred vision, seizures, numbness in the arms and legs, and difficulty breathing.\n\n[Terrorism > Snakebites > Top view of a pit viper]\nPit vipers such as rattlesnakes, cottonmouths, and copperheads have a triangular head when viewed from above (left).

They have round eyes and a black nose and alternating rings of red, yellow, and black (the narrow yellow rings always separate the red rings from the black). All poisonous snakes have long fangs.\n\nSymptoms of a coral snake bite include slight pain and swelling at the site of the bite, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, difficulty speaking or swallowing, drooling, drowsiness, sweating, nausea and vomiting, confusion, weakness, dizziness, joint pain, paralysis, and difficulty breathing.\n\nIf there is no swelling within 4 hours (for a pit viper bite) and 6 hours (for a coral snake bite), the snake was probably not poisonous.\n\n[Terrorism > Snakebites > If someone has been bitten by a poisonous snake:]\n1. Call 911 or your local emergency number or the national poison center (1-800-222-1222). Do not try to suck out the venom (you could poison yourself).\n\n1. If the person is not breathing, start mouth-to-mouth resuscitation immediately (see page 156). If the person's heart has stopped, perform CPR if you have had CPR training.\n2. If a snakebite kit is available, immediately use the suction cups from the kit to draw out body fluids containing the venom.\n3. Keep the person calm, which will slow circulation and help stop the spread of the venom.\n4. Remove any jewelry.\n5. Immobilize the bitten arm or leg, and keep it below the level of the heart. Keep the person calm, and do not let him or her walk.\n6. Wash the bite area thoroughly. Do not apply ice or very cold water; it could damage the skin. Cover the bite with a sterile dressing.\n7. If the person is not nauseated or vomiting, is not having seizures, and is conscious, give him or her small sips of water. Do not give alcoholic beverages.\n8. If you can safely capture and kill the snake (preferably without damaging its head), take it with you to the emergency department. Do not handle the head. The severed head of a snake can inject poison for up to an hour after the snake has died. If you cannot bring the snake with you to the doctor, try to describe the snake.\n\n[Terrorism > Identifying pit vipers]\nPoisonous snakes such as pit vipers have long fangs, slitlike eyes, and pits that contain sacs of poison between their eyes and their nostrils.\n\n![Diagram of a snake showing key features: Slitlike eyes, Nostril, Pit, and Fang.]()![](_page_376_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n[Terrorism > Animal Bites]\nBites from a domesticated animal (such as a dog or cat) or a wild animal (such as a squirrel or raccoon) can result in serious infection and tissue damage.

The discoloration and swelling in the skin are caused by blood seeping into the tissues. The skin will usually turn colors—from reddish blue, to green and yellow, to brown—before fading. Bruises usually disappear without treatment after 10 to 14 days.\n\nBruises on the head or shin or around the eye (a black eye) may swell significantly because bone is just beneath the skin and there is little fatty tissue to cushion the blow. If a bruise does not fade or disappear completely or if it becomes painful and swollen, or if bruises continue to appear for no reason, see your doctor. You may have a broken bone or other injury or a blood-clotting disorder.\n\n[Terrorism > Bruises > To treat a bruise:]\n1. Gently apply an ice pack or a cold, wet cloth to the bruise to reduce bleeding, pain, and swelling. Don't apply too much pressure.\n2. If the bruise is on an arm or leg, elevate it above the level of the heart to decrease blood flow to the area.\n3. After 24 hours, apply a warm washcloth or a heating pad to aid healing.\n\n[Terrorism > WARNING! > Unusual Bruises]\nYou should suspect that someone (especially a child or an incapacitated or older person) has been a victim of abuse if he or she has any of the following signs:\n\n- Bruises on fleshy areas such as the face, back, abdomen, thighs, or buttocks\n- Bruises in generally protected areas such as the neck (possibly from choking), chest, or genitals\n\n- Bruises with distinctive and recognizable shapes of objects such as clothes hangers or belt buckles\n- Multiple bruises in various stages of healing\n\n[Terrorism > Splinters]\nA small splinter usually can be removed easily with tweezers. A splinter in the eye should be removed only by a doctor. If a splinter breaks off in the skin, is deeply lodged, or cannot be removed, see your doctor as soon as possible. You should also see a doctor if the wound becomes infected or if red streaks radiate from the wound (which is a sign that the infection is spreading in the bloodstream).\n\n[Terrorism > Splinters > To remove a splinter from the skin:]\n1. Wash your hands and the skin around the splinter with soap and water.\n2. Sterilize tweezers (and any other instrument you may need, such as a needle or razor blade) with rubbing alcohol or by placing them over an open flame or in boiling water and letting them cool. If the splinter is sticking out of the skin, place the open tweezers directly on the skin on either side of the splinter (pushing on the skin slightly), and gently pull on the splinter in the direction in which it entered the skin.\n3. If the splinter is embedded just under the skin, gently loosen the skin around the splinter with a sterilized needle or the tip of a sterilized razor blade. Lift the end of the splinter with the end of the needle or tip of the razor blade. Carefully remove all of the splinter with the sterilized tweezers.\n4. Squeeze the wound gently to promote slight bleeding, which will force out some of the germs.\n5. Wash the area with soap and water, and apply a bandage.\n\n[Terrorism > Foreign Object in the Eye]\nNever try to remove anything that is stuck in the eye or is on the pupil of the eye. If a person has something embedded in his or her eye, do not let the person rub it. Gently cover both eyes with a sterile compress and lightly bandage it in place. Covering both eyes helps stop eye movement, which can help minimize eye damage and pain. Call 911 or your local emergency number, or get the person to a hospital emergency department immediately.\n\nIf an object such as a piece of dirt or an eyelash is floating on the white or inside corner of the eye or on the inside of the eyelid, you can try to remove it. Symptoms of something in the eye include pain, a burning sensation, tearing, redness, or sensitivity to light.\n\n**To remove a foreign object that is not embedded in the eye:**\n\n1. Wash your hands with soap and water.\n2. If the person is wearing contact lenses, remove (or have the person remove) the lenses if they can be removed easily.\n3. Gently pull the upper eyelid out and down over the lower eyelid, and hold the upper lid down for a few seconds. This should cause tears to flow, which may wash out the particle.

If the woman's contractions are about 2 minutes apart, if she feels like pushing, or if the baby's head is visible in the vaginal opening, birth will usually occur very soon.\n\nChildbirth is a natural process, and most deliveries do not have complications. However, delivery is bloody. Call or have someone call 911 or your local emergency number, or send someone for help. Try to get the woman to the nearest hospital emergency department if possible. If not, a doctor may be able to give you instructions over the phone. Do not try to delay or prevent the birth by crossing the woman's legs or pushing on the baby's head, which can seriously harm the baby.\n\n[Terrorism > Foreign Object in the Eye > **To help deliver a baby:**]\n1. Put clean sheets on a bed (with a rubber sheet or shower curtain underneath if possible). If a bed is not available, place clean clothing or newspapers under\n\nthe woman or at least under her hips and thighs.

Support the baby's head and body with one hand while grasping the baby's legs and ankles with the other (get a firm grip because the baby will be very slippery). Position the baby so that his or her head is lower than the feet to allow any membranes or fluid to drain from the baby's lungs, mouth, and nose. Do not hold the baby completely upside down by the ankles or slap or hit him or her.\n2. Gently wipe any fluid or membranes out of the baby's mouth and nose (preferably with a sterile gauze or clean cloth).\n\n[Terrorism > Foreign Object in the Eye > Wipe fluid or membranes from the mouth and nose]\n![Illustration of a healthcare provider gently wiping the mouth and nose of a baby.]()![](_page_390_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\n1. If the baby has not cried or is not breathing, gently rub his or her chest, or tap the bottoms of the feet. If the baby still is not breathing, perform artificial respiration (see page 156).\n2. Once the baby has started breathing, wrap him or her up snugly (including the top of the head). Do not clean the cheesy white coating from the baby's skin, eyes, or ears (it is a protective covering).\n3. If the woman can be taken to a hospital immediately after the delivery of the placenta (which occurs about 5 to 20 minutes after delivery), the baby can be left attached to the cord and placenta.\n4.

What should be done about them?\n- Does the medication interact with any other drugs that the person is taking?\n- Should the person avoid certain foods?\n- Does the medication have lasting effects?\n- Does the medication have any warnings?\n- Does the medication come in various forms? For example, if the person has problems swallowing pills, ask if the medication is available as a liquid.\n\nRemember that all medications must be taken exactly as prescribed by the doctor. Never stop giving medication without the doctor's permission.\n\n[Terrorism > WARNING! > Allergic Reactions and Unpleasant Side Effects]\nSome medications can cause an allergic reaction (producing symptoms such as hives, itching, a rash, or wheezing) or side effects (such as nausea or dizziness). If the person develops any of these symptoms, call the doctor immediately to find out if you should stop giving the medication. The doctor may need to adjust the dosage or change medications.\n\n[Terrorism > WARNING! > Providing a Healthy Diet]\nHealthy eating is essential for maintaining the person's health and well-being and also can promote successful recovery. If the doctor has not prescribed a special diet for the person, you can provide the foods that he or she normally eats.\n\nAdequate fluid intake also is an important part of a healthy diet. Most people should drink at least eight glasses of fluid every day, including water, milk, juice, broth, or caffeine-free coffee, tea, or soft drinks. If the doctor limits the person's daily fluid intake, follow the doctor's instructions.\n\nThe following tips can make it easier for the person to consume a healthful diet. Adapt them to the person's needs:\n\n- Slice, dice, chop, mash, or purée foods to make them easier to chew and swallow.\n- Look for ways to add calories and nutrients to the diet of a person who is at risk for weight loss. For example, fortified milk shakes can be tasty and nutritious. Ask your doctor if the person you are caring for could benefit from nutritional supplements that provide added nutrients and calories.\n- People with decreased appetites may consume more calories by eating five or six smaller meals throughout the day rather than three large meals.\n- Ask the person what foods he or she likes or dislikes.\n- Make meals look attractive.\n- Eat meals together whenever possible. Mealtime rituals can be comforting and can help restore a sense of normalcy to a person's life.\n- If a stroke has paralyzed one side of a person's body, food may tend to collect in the paralyzed cheek. If this occurs, gently knead the cheek with your finger while the person is chewing, to help move the food along.\n- If the person is able to exercise, encourage and help him or her to do so. Regular exercise stimulates the appetite and helps prevent constipation. Ask the doctor which exercises are best.\n\n[Terrorism > *Assisting With Eating*]\nIf the person cannot feed himself or herself, you must feed him or her. Cut food into small, bite-size pieces, or purée it to make it easy to chew and swallow. Before feeding the person, be sure he or she is sitting upright in a comfortable position. Tuck a napkin or hand towel under the chin to catch any spills. Taste the food to be sure it is not too hot. Because feeding someone can be a lengthy process, keep the food warm in a warming dish.\n\nIf the person cannot chew or swallow—because of oral radiation treatments, jaw injury, or stroke, for example—you may need to provide nutrition through a feeding tube or intravenously (directly into a vein). The doctor or nurse will teach you how to do this correctly and safely. Watch closely for any signs of infection: pain, redness, or swelling at the insertion site of the intravenous needle or feeding tube, or fever.\n\nGood oral hygiene is essential", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "medications", "relation": "treats", "tail": "needs"}, {"head": "registered nurse", "relation": "provides", "tail": "expertise"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "patient", "relation": "participates in", "tail": "[Event: clinical trial]"}, {"head": "caregiver", "relation": "performs", "tail": "[Event: giving medications]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

Place a large towel under the person to protect the bedding before bringing him or her a basin of warm water, mild soap, and a washcloth. Be sure that the room is warm, and provide another large towel to drape over the person for warmth and privacy. The person should give himself or herself a sponge bath once a day.\n\nIf the person you are caring for is unable to bathe without help, you can give him or her a bath in bed. Although giving a bed bath presents its own challenges, it is not a difficult task to perform once you have mastered the routine. Make sure that the room is warm before undressing the person, taking care to provide as much privacy as possible. Cover him or her with a large towel and place another towel underneath to protect the bedding. Before you begin, check the water to make sure it is at a comfortable temperature. When you use soap, make sure it is a mild soap that will not dry out or irritate the person's skin.\n\nAs you bathe the person, look carefully for sores, rashes, or other skin problems. If the person is recovering from surgery, be sure to examine the incision carefully to make sure it is healing properly. Some indications of possible infection include fever; redness, pain, and swelling around the incision; and pus. It is important to report any of these signs to the doctor or nurse immediately.\n\nWhen giving a bed bath, wash and dry one area of the person's body at a time, uncovering only the part of the body you are washing. This helps keep the person warm and maintains a sense of privacy.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n1. Use plain water to bathe the person, starting at the head. Use soap only in sweaty areas (such as the armpits, groin, and buttocks); wash between skin folds. Be thorough but gentle. Change the water as needed.\n2. Gently pat the person dry with a fresh, soft towel; don't rub.\n3. Roll the person onto one side to wash and dry his or her back.\n4. Let the person dip his or her hands into a basin of fresh water. This is more refreshing than having the hands wiped with a washcloth.\n5. Before helping the person dress, make sure that every area of his or her body is thoroughly dry. Provide or apply deodorant, lotion, or body powder as needed.\n\n[Terrorism > Bathing > Helping With Toileting Needs]\nBladder and bowel movements can be difficult for people who cannot use the toilet. A person who is confined to bed will need to use a bedpan or commode; a man may be able to use a handheld urinal. If a person cannot use these devices, he or she may need to wear absorbent disposable briefs. Always give the person complete privacy.\n\nIf the person cannot wipe after urinating or having a bowel movement, you will need to do it for him or her. Keeping the genital and anal areas clean helps prevent the skin from breaking down. Always wipe a woman or girl gently from front to back (from the vagina to the anus) to ensure that bacteria do not enter the vagina or urinary tract and cause infection.\n\nSome caregivers need to give an enema (by injecting a liquid into the rectum) to relieve constipation (see page 769) or an accumulation of hardened feces in the rectum (fecal impaction). If the person has an indwelling catheter (a plastic tube inserted directly into the bladder) that drains urine into a bag, you will need to empty and clean the bag regularly. (A doctor or other health care professional will change the catheter periodically.) Learn to perform these tasks correctly from a trained health care professional. Ask for clear, precise instructions.\n\n[Terrorism > Bathing > *Using a Commode*]\nIf the person is able to get out of bed for brief periods, using a bedside commode may be easiest. Assist the person out of bed and onto the commode. If necessary, help the person wipe himself or herself, and then help him or her back into bed. Empty the removable pan into the toilet. Rinse the pan out, clean it thoroughly with a household disinfectant diluted with water, and return it to the commode.\n\n[Terrorism > *Using a Bedpan*]\nA person who is confined to bed will need to use a bedpan, which can be awkward. In addition to giving the person privacy, be sure to give him or her plenty of time. A person who is embarrassed about using a bedpan or who feels pressured while using one may be reluctant to ask for it when he or she needs it. Resisting the urge to have a bowel movement can lead to constipation and fecal impaction. Remember to ask the person frequently if he or she needs to use the bedpan—and keep it within easy reach and in the same place so it can be found quickly when needed.\n\nBefore giving the person a bedpan, sprinkle a small amount of body powder on the rim of the bedpan to make it easier to slip under the buttocks. The open end of the bedpan should always be toward the person's feet.

In older people, early detection and treatment of depression are extremely important because of the high risk of suicide. If you notice that the person you are caring for has any of the following signs or symptoms for more than a few days, talk to his or her doctor immediately:\n\n- Changes in appetite (decrease or increase)\n- Weight loss or weight gain\n- Changes in mood or emotions\n- Lack of responsiveness or attentiveness\n- Loss of interest in favorite activities\n- Feelings of hopelessness or helplessness\n\nSome people incorrectly assume that symptoms of depression are a normal part of aging or mistake symptoms of depression for Alzheimer's disease (see page 688), dementia (see page 689), or another illness. If the diagnosis is depression, it can be successfully treated with medication, psychotherapy, or a combination of both, at any age.\n\n[Terrorism > *Fever*]\nAlthough a fever is not usually dangerous, notify the person's doctor if the person you are caring for has a fever. Always check with the person's doctor before giving aspirin or an aspirin substitute. The doctor may prescribe a medication to reduce the fever. If the person's temperature continues to rise after he or she has been given medication to reduce it, call his or her doctor immediately. Never try to raise the temperature of a\n\nperson who has a fever (such as by turning up the heat or putting extra blankets or other coverings on him or her). Raising a person's temperature abnormally high can cause seizures or loss of consciousness.\n\nTo help reduce the person's temperature, sponge his or her face, neck, trunk, arms, and legs with lukewarm water and let it evaporate on the skin. Evaporation brings down the temperature of the skin. Encourage the person to drink plenty of water, a sports drink, fruit juice, or broth to replace the fluids that will be lost through the excessive perspiration that accompanies a fever.\n\n[Terrorism > *Vomiting*]\nMedications and treatments such as radiation therapy can cause nausea and vomiting. However, because vomiting can also be a sign of an illness or underlying health problem, tell the doctor if the person you are caring for is vomiting, especially if he or she is vomiting repeatedly. The doctor may tell you to watch for signs of dehydration such as thirst, dry lips and mouth, dizziness, headache, confusion, muscle weakness, shakiness, and a reduced output of urine. Dehydration is a potentially dangerous condition that can lead to coma and death.\n\nIf the person is confined to bed or cannot get to a bathroom quickly, leave a container (such as a bowl or dishpan) at the bedside for him or her to vomit into. Some people want to be left alone when vomiting, while others find it comforting to have someone with them. If the person finds it reassuring, hold his or her forehead while he or she is vomiting. After the person has vomited, offer some water to rinse out his or her mouth and a bowl to spit into. Then gently wipe off his or her face using cool or lukewarm water.\n\nAs soon as the nausea ends, give sips of water, tea, ginger ale, broth, or fruit drinks to replace lost body fluids. Unless told to do so by the doctor, do not give the person solid food for several hours after he or she has stopped vomiting, and then give something that won't upset his or her stomach (such as gelatin).\n\n[Terrorism > *Memory Problems*]\nPeople of all ages can forget to call a relative on his or her birthday or leave some of the ingredients out of a favorite recipe. These types of memory problems are normal and do not interfere with the ability to function. More serious memory problems sometimes accompany aging. When an older person realizes that his or her memory is not as good\n\nas it once was, he or she may begin to feel apprehensive, fearful, and anxious. Forgetfulness may cause an older person to assume that he or she is developing dementia (see page 689) or Alzheimer's disease (see page 688). Reassure the person, and try the following strategies to help him or her remember better:\n\n- Make signs to remind the person to do things such as take medication, turn off the stove, or lock the doors. Place the signs in a visible location. Put signs along the way to the bathroom, with a sign that reads \"BATHROOM\" attached to the bathroom door.\n- Give the person a large calendar with large numbers to help him or her keep track of dates and events by checking off each day of the week.\n- Circle dates on the calendar as a reminder of important appointments and dates.\n- Provide clocks with large, easy-to-read numbers to help the person stay time-oriented.\n- Follow a regular mealtime schedule; people with memory problems often forget to eat.\n- Post a daily checklist on the refrigerator door to remind the person of the things he or she needs to do.\n- Place items to bring upstairs near the foot of the stairs (but never ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "depression", "relation": "at high risk for", "tail": "ill or disabled"}, {"head": "depression", "relation": "high risk of", "tail": "suicide"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

To prevent a fall, have the person sit up slowly and rest on the edge of the bed for a few minutes before trying to stand up. Place a sturdy chair beside the bed. When the person feels steady, stand directly in front of him or her so he or she can lean on you for support. Hold the person under the arms. Then help the person turn slowly, and gently and carefully lower him or her into the chair. As the person begins to feel stronger, have him or her try to take a few steps, using your arms for support.\n\n[Terrorism > *Increasing Circulation* > Positioning an Immobile Person in Bed]\nA person who is confined to bed often tends to slide toward the foot of the bed. To move an immobile person toward the head of the bed, you first need to help him or her to a sitting position.\n\nAn immobile person's body should always be properly positioned to help prevent deformities. Proper positioning can be achieved using pillows and bolsters. For example, when a person is lying on his or her side, instead of elevating the head of the bed, place a pillow under the upper leg and arm. And place a pillow or bolster behind\n\nthe person's back to prevent him or her from rolling backward. A person who has little fat on the hips should not be positioned fully on his or her side. Instead, position him or her in a 30-degree side-lying position to help prevent the development of pressure sores in the hip area.\n\n[Terrorism > Moving a Person in Bed]\n1. To help the person sit up in bed, first arrange the pillows so that his or her shoulders are elevated. Cross the person's arms at his or her waist. Place your hands over the person's shoulders and place your knee on the bed, next to his or her hip. Place your other foot firmly on the floor next to the bed, slightly ahead of your knee and even with the person's waist.\n\n![Illustration showing a person assisting another person in bed by placing their hands over the shoulders and using their knee and foot to help the person sit up.]()![](_page_414_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n2. Firmly grasp the person's shoulders, keeping your arms straight, and slowly move back, using your weight to pull him or her up toward you.\n\n![Illustration showing a person kneeling and supporting a seated person on a bed, demonstrating a supportive position.]()![](_page_415_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n3. If you want to move the person toward the head of the bed, keep your hand on the shoulder closer to you and get in position behind him or her. Place your knee on the bed behind the person and place your other foot firmly on the floor. Cross the person's forearms in front of his or her waist and hold them firmly from behind. Slowly move back, using your weight to pull the person toward you.\n\n![Illustration showing a person leaning over a seated person on a bed, holding the person's forearms crossed in front of the waist, demonstrating a supportive position for moving the person toward the head of the bed.]()![](_page_415_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\nAn immobile person who is confined to bed should not remain in the same position for longer than 2 hours while the caregiver is awake. Move the person from his or her side, onto his or her back, and onto the other side every 2 hours. When the immobile person is on his or her back, position a pillow under each arm and on the side of each thigh to prevent outward hip rotation. Also, place a small pillow under the knees and a footboard at the foot of the bed to keep the person's feet positioned at a right angle to the mattress. This positioning will prevent the development of footdrop (a condition in which the foot hangs limply from the ankle) and keep the person from sliding down the bed.\n\nDo not tuck sheets and blankets tightly around the person's feet and legs; keep blankets and other coverings elevated with a bed or foot cradle (a tentlike device placed at the foot of the bed). Keep bottom sheets taut to prevent them from wrinkling or gathering under the person's body, which could cause pressure sores.\n\nWhen feeding a person in bed, elevate the head of the bed at least 30 degrees to prevent choking, and keep the bed raised for at least an hour after eating. This positioning helps prevent the person from regurgitating food, which can cause him or her to accidentally breathe food into the lungs and choke. Breathing foreign particles into the lungs can lead to pneumonia.\n\n[Terrorism > Moving a Person in Bed > Moving an Immobile Person]\nWhen moving an immobile person to a chair, wheelchair, or commode, wear sturdy shoes with nonskid soles, and make sure that the person you are moving is also wearing sturdy, nonskid shoes or slippers.

Here are some things you can do:\n\n- Make sure that light switches are within easy reach of doorways so the person does not have to cross a dark room to turn on a light. Lighting that is too dim can make it difficult to see. Use high-watt bulbs but make sure they are frosted to reduce glare.\n- Place a lamp within reach of the person's bed. Put night-lights along the pathways between the bedrooms and the bathroom and a night-light in the bathroom.\n- Remove loose rugs, mats, and runners. Make sure that all other carpets and rugs have slip-resistant backing or that they are tacked down to prevent trips and slips.\n- Arrange furniture so the person has a clear, unobstructed path from one place to another. Keep hallways and stairs clear and uncluttered. Take special care with placement of furniture that has sharp or pointed corners or that is easy to bump into or fall over such as ottomans and coffee tables. Remove any furniture that is not being used. Provide a remote control for the television.\n- Keep telephone and electrical cords out of pathways.\n- Provide sturdy handrails on both sides of all stairways, 30 inches above the steps. Use nonskid treads on all bare steps. If a stairway is carpeted, make sure that the carpeting is tacked down securely on every step. Do not put loose rugs at the top or bottom of stairways. All stairways should be well lit. Do not keep toys or other items on stairs. Have an electric stair lift installed if the person can no longer climb the stairs. If there is a bathroom on the first floor, move the person's bedroom there.\n- Make sure chairs and tables are sturdy, stable, and balanced in case the person leans on them for support.\n- Set the thermostat at a warm temperature (at least 72°F) to help keep an older person's joints from stiffening. Stiff joints can lead to falls.\n- Place guardrails on the bed or a sturdy chair bedside to help the person get in and out of bed. Place a telephone with volume control and a lighted dial next to the bed.\n- Place a nonslip rubber mat on the floor in front of the sink. Clean up spills on the floor and countertops immediately. Keep frequently used items within easy reach to avoid having to bend or climb up on a chair or stepladder to reach them. Be sure that the person wears low-heeled, slip-resistant shoes that fit properly.\n- Put a nonslip rubber mat or nonslip adhesive strips on the floor of the tub or shower. Install handrails and grab bars that are attached to underlying studs on the walls around the toilet and along the bathtub. Tell the person you are caring for never to use towel\n\nbars for support—they are not strong enough. Place a nonslip bath mat on the floor outside the tub or shower. Some people find an elevated toilet seat easier to use.\n\n- Do not lock the bathroom door. It may be necessary to remove locks to prevent the person from accidentally locking himself or herself in the bathroom.\n\n- Have all medications reviewed by the person's doctor to be sure that they are necessary, especially drugs with possible side effects such as drowsiness, dizziness, or fainting.\n\n- When going outdoors, have the person wear comfortable, sturdy walking shoes with soles that grip the pavement. If he or she uses a cane or walker, make sure it is sturdy and in good condition. Encourage the person to stay indoors, if possible, when the weather is bad, especially when the pavement is wet or icy. During the winter, keep porches, steps, sidewalks, and driveways clear of snow and ice. Always spread sand or salt on icy surfaces.\n\n- A person who has difficulty walking may benefit from working with a physical therapist, either as an outpatient or through a home health care agency. If walking is a problem, talk to your doctor about having a gait evaluation and starting an exercise program to improve the person's ability to walk and increase his or her strength.\n\nIn spite of the best preventive measures, falls still may occur. If the person you are caring for falls, don't move him or her; try to determine the nature and extent of any injuries, and call for emergency medical assistance immediately.\n\n[Terrorism > Regulating Home Temperature]\nAs you age, your body becomes less able to regulate temperature. A life-threatening drop in body temperature (hypothermia; see page 165) can develop quickly in an older person if the room temperature is lower than 65°F. Make sure that the heating system in your loved one's home is in proper working order and that there is enough heat throughout the day, especially if the person lives in an apartment building, where tenants usually do not have control over the heat.

Get in the habit of asking for help as soon as you need it. Do not wait until a situation becomes unmanageable. Every member of the household should participate or contribute in some way—doing chores, running errands, preparing meals, making telephone calls, or providing company.\n\nBe ready to ask for help by keeping a list handy of all the things that need to be done. For example, ask friends or family to come over and stay with the person so you can go out. To get time on your own at home, ask them to go shopping for you or to accompany the person to the doctor's office. And do not hesitate to accept help when it's offered.\n\nIf you cannot rely on friends, neighbors, or family members, ask your doctor for a referral to a visiting nurse association, which can send a nurse to evaluate the situation and provide some needed help. Consider hiring a household helper, home health aide, or companion to help you with day-today tasks. If family members cannot give their time, perhaps they can offer financial support for help you need. Some hospitals and nursing homes have respite facilities where you can bring your loved one for a short period while you go away on a trip, make up the needed sleep you might have lost, or just stay home and enjoy the solitude. Inquire about the governmental services the person may be entitled to that could help you with required tasks—meal delivery service, homemaker service, respite care, shopping service, case management, transportation service, or taxi service. You may want to attend a support group in your community. Ask your doctor to recommend one.\n\n[Terrorism > Asking for and Accepting Help From Others > Caregiver Self-Assessment Questionnaire]\nCaregivers often are so concerned with caring for another person's needs that they lose sight of their own well-being. If you are a caregiver, answer the following questions and then do the self-evaluation to determine your level of stress.\n\nDuring the past week or so, I:\n\n1.

During these visits, the doctor will examine your child, make sure that he or she has all the required vaccinations, and treat any disorders. Take advantage of these visits to talk with the doctor about any concerns or questions you have about your child's health or development.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Examining a Newborn]\nImmediately after delivery, the doctor and nurses in the delivery room examine a newborn to make sure that he or she is healthy. They use a suction device to remove any mucus from inside the baby's nose and mouth, put antibiotic drops in his or her eyes to\n\nprevent infection, and give him or her an injection of vitamin K to help the blood clot normally. The doctor evaluates the infant's heart rate and breathing; measures his or her length, weight, and head circumference; and performs a thorough physical examination to look for any physical abnormalities. All babies are given screening tests for some disorders and an evaluation, called the Apgar score, of their general health status.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *The Apgar Score*]\nThe Apgar score assesses heart rate, breathing and crying, muscle tone, reflex responses, and skin color (examining the inside of the mouth and lips, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet). Each of these five components is given a number from 0 to 2, and then all five are added up. A score between 7 and 10 is a general indication that the infant is healthy. The score does not, however, predict a baby's development or long-term health.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *The Apgar Score* > **Physical examination of newborns**]\nA physical examination is performed on newborns immediately after birth to check for birth defects or other abnormalities. In most cases, early detection helps ensure successful treatment. For example, the child's mouth is examined for cleft lip and cleft palate, and his or her face is examined for features of Down syndrome (top). The infant's anus is checked to make sure it is open, the genitals are checked to verify the baby's sex, the navel is examined for swelling (a sign of an umbilical hernia), the feet are examined for clubfoot, and the hips are checked for dislocation (center). The spine is examined for any swelling or opening that could indicate spina bifida (bottom).\n\n![Illustration showing a healthcare provider examining a newborn's mouth and face.]()![](_page_660_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nExamining the mouth and face\n\n![Illustration showing a healthcare provider examining a newborn's genitals, navel, feet, and hips.]()![](_page_660_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\nExamining the genitals, navel, feet, and hips\n\n![Illustration showing a healthcare provider examining a newborn's spine.]()![](_page_660_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\nExamining the spine\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Newborn Screening Tests*]\nEvery state requires testing of newborns for a variety of disorders 24 hours after birth, before the child is released from the hospital. Some of these disorders cause no symptoms initially but can lead to serious health problems or can be fatal. Testing is done immediately after birth because the risk of complications is reduced significantly when these disorders are diagnosed and treated early. Abnormal results are followed up with more thorough, precise testing.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Newborn Screening Tests* > **Newborn testing**]\nFrom a small sample of blood taken from a newborn's heel, doctors can diagnose a number of serious but treatable disorders, including sickle cell disease and\n\nphenylketonuria (PKU).

Your doctor will tell you when your child needs each vaccination. Keep a record of all your child's vaccinations and bring the record to each visit to make sure your child's immunizations are up-to-date.\n\nAll vaccinations are given in shots, usually into the outer, upper part of the thigh or arm. Some vaccinations—such as for measles, mumps, and rubella—are combined and given in a single injection.

The measurement is compared against the average healthy range for children of the same age and sex. If your child has high blood pressure, the doctor will want to find the cause and will recommend treatment if necessary. High blood pressure can be a sign of a serious disorder such as kidney disease, heart disease, or thyroid disorders. It can also result from being overweight. If your child is overweight, the doctor will recommend a weight-loss program that will include a healthy diet and an increase in exercise; weight loss can significantly lower blood pressure.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Blood Tests*]\nAll children are given a blood test at one time or another, either to diagnose a disorder such as an infection or to screen for disorders such as anemia.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Blood Tests* > **Complete blood cell count**]\nA complete blood cell (CBC) count measures the major components of blood, including red cells (which deliver oxygen to cells), white cells (which fight infection), and platelets (which help blood to clot).

In addition, reading to infants and very young children helps calm, comfort, and entertain them. It also helps\n\nthem develop their eye muscles. Take time to read to your child every day, and make the experience special and fun.\n\n![Illustration of a man reading a book to a baby.]()![](_page_670_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nAt 24 months a child usually:\n\n- Knows several hundred words\n- Speaks in two- to three-word phrases\n- Points to body parts when asked\n- Runs and jumps\n- Walks backward\n- Goes down stairs\n- Throws and kicks a ball\n- Feeds self with a fork and a spoon\n- Drinks from a straw\n- Undresses self\n- Opens doors, drawers, and boxes\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Reading to your child > Measuring Your Child's Growth]\nA child's growth rate is a good indicator of his or her general health. To monitor a child's growth at each visit, a doctor measures and records his or\n\nher height and weight and head circumference (if the child is under 2) and compares these measurements with those taken during previous visits. This helps the doctor determine if the child is growing at a healthy rate.\n\nThe doctor also compares your child's measurements against the average length and weight ranges for children the same age. Growth rates vary considerably among children and, as long as your child is growing at a steady rate, there usually is no cause for concern.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Opening doors]\nTwo-year-olds like to explore and are eager to learn new skills, such as opening doors. To help keep your child safe, install childproof locks on any doors that you don't want him or her to open.\n\n![Illustration of a young child reaching up to open a door handle.]()![](_page_671_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Your Child's Teeth]\nAt about 6 months of age, a child's primary (baby) teeth begin to come in. In most cases, a child has a full set of primary teeth by the time he or she is 2 years old. A baby's first\n\nteeth, the incisors, usually appear during the first year and seldom cause problems. The baby may be irritable, cry more than usual, and have difficulty sleeping. Gums may be red and swollen, and the baby may drool more than usual and gnaw on his or her fingers. You may be able to see the teeth coming through the gums. Your baby's feeding, sleeping, and bowel habits may change, but he or she usually has very little pain.\n\nThe first and second molars, which usually appear between ages 1 and 3, are much more likely to cause discomfort. Gums may be tender, making eating painful, and the cheek on the affected side of the mouth may feel hot and look flushed. To help relieve your child's discomfort, rub his or her gums gently, give the child a cool drink from a cup, or give him or her a teething ring, teething biscuit, or bagel to chew. To relieve pain, give the child acetaminophen or ibuprofen (not aspirin), or rub his or her gums with an over-the-counter, pain-relieving dental cream or gel for children.\n\nIn some cases, a disease or disorder in a child may be overlooked because parents attribute the symptoms to teething. For example, clutching one side of the face may be a sign of an ear infection (see page 417) rather than teething-related discomfort. Therefore, you should talk to your doctor if your child of teething age shows any signs of distress.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Teeth]\nThe ages at which both baby teeth and permanent teeth appear vary from one child to another. Some children have one tooth or more at birth; others may have no teeth at 1 year. The ages listed here are averages, are intended for comparison purposes only, and do not reflect a child's general health or development.\n\n**Full set of baby teeth: 20**\n\nDiagram illustrating the stages of baby teeth eruption in the upper jaw.\n\n**Top Diagram (Upper Jaw):**\n\n- First incisor\n- Second incisor\n- Canine\n- First molar\n- Second molar\n\n**Bottom Diagram (Upper Jaw):**\n\n- Second molar\n- First molar\n- Canine\n- Second incisor\n- First incisor\n\n![](_page_673_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Teeth > Ages When Baby Teeth Come In]\n| Age       | Baby Teeth      |\n|-----------|-----------------|\n| 6 months  | First incisors  |\n| 7 months  | Second incisors |\n| 12 months | First molars    |\n| 18 months | Canines         |\n| 2-3 years | Second molars   |\n\nFull set of permanent teeth: 32\n\nDiagram illustrating the arrangement of permanent teeth in the upper and lower arches, ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "tummy time", "relation": "exercises", "tail": "muscle groups"}, {"head": "crawling", "relation": "gives opportunity to explore", "tail": "child"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "child", "relation": "participates in", "tail": "[Event: crawling]"}, {"head": "parent", "relation": "supervises", "tail": "[Event: child crawling]"}, {"head": "child", "relation": "benefits from", "tail": "[Event: reading to child]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: not enough tummy time]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: delayed crawling]"}, {"head": "[Event: insufficient supervision]", "relation": "may lead to", "tail": "[Event: injury during crawling]"}]}, "status": "success"}

A prolonged lack of oxygen in the blood may permanently damage the baby's brain or lungs. The more premature a baby is, the greater the risk of respiratory distress syndrome. The disorder occurs frequently in babies who weigh less than 3 pounds at birth and also is common in infants whose mothers have diabetes (see page 889).\n\nAfter a baby's first breath has caused his or her lungs to expand, the alveoli (tiny air sacs in the lungs) are kept open by a natural chemical in the lungs called surfactant.\n\nKeeping the alveoli open is essential for breathing, because oxygen passes into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide enters the lungs to be exhaled through the capillaries (small blood vessels) that surround the alveoli. In babies with respiratory distress syndrome, however, the lungs do not contain enough surfactant, and the alveoli start to close again within minutes or hours after birth, leading to increasing difficulty breathing and inadequate exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nIn respiratory distress syndrome, a baby's breathing gradually becomes more and more labored and rapid in the first few hours after birth. As the baby breathes in, his or her chest sinks (rather than expands, as it normally would). When breathing out, the baby grunts.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome is based on the baby's symptoms and the amount of surfactant in the baby's lungs. In some cases, a doctor may be able to determine the amount of surfactant in a fetus's lungs before delivery by performing amniocentesis (see page 510). If the amount of surfactant appears to be inadequate, it may be increased by giving the pregnant woman an injection of a corticosteroid medication, which stimulates the production of surfactant in the fetus's lungs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nA baby who has respiratory distress syndrome or who is at risk of developing it is treated in a hospital neonatal intensive care unit (ICU). Treatment includes placing an inhaler over the baby's face to administer artificial surfactant to open the alveoli and help restore normal breathing. The infant also may be given artificial respiration, in which a tube is threaded into his or her trachea (windpipe) to deliver oxygen to the lungs. The baby's blood will be continuously monitored to determine the levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other body chemicals, including bicarbonate, sodium, potassium, and chloride. After treatment with artificial surfactant, infants who are very premature (born before the 28th week of pregnancy) or who are very small (about 3 pounds or less) remain at risk for respiratory distress syndrome and must be closely monitored in a neonatal ICU for signs of breathing problems.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Respiratory distress syndrome]\nThe alveoli produce a substance called surfactant, which normally coats and protects the alveoli and enables them to stay open (left) so they can absorb oxygen from inhaled air. Without surfactant, an alveolus collapses (right), causing the labored breathing that is characteristic of respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n![Diagram illustrating a normal alveolus (left) and an alveolus without surfactant (right). The normal alveolus shows the alveolar sac filled with air, and the alveolar walls are coated with surfactant. The collapsed alveolus (right) shows the alveolar sac collapsed, indicating the absence of surfactant.]()![](_page_678_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Neonatal Jaundice]\nNeonatal jaundice is yellowing of an infant's skin and the whites of the eyes that occurs soon after birth. The condition is caused by an excess of bilirubin (a waste product of the normal breakdown of red blood cells) in the blood. Normally, bilirubin is removed from the blood by the liver. In a newborn, jaundice usually occurs because the liver is not yet fully developed and cannot process the bilirubin fast enough. This type of neonatal jaundice is called physiological jaundice and occurs in more than half of all newborns.\n\nAn uncommon form of neonatal jaundice, called hemolytic jaundice, can result from a condition called Rhesus (Rh) incompatibility (see page 508), in which antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) from the mother's blood enter the fetus's blood and combine with the fetus's red blood cells, causing the cells to break down much more quickly than normal. This early breakdown of red blood cells results in excess release of bilirubin into the bloodstream, causing the baby to have severe jaundice at birth or soon after. In some cases, blood type (ABO) incompatibility, in which the blood types (A, B, AB, or O) differ betw", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "preterm infants", "relation": "are affected by", "tail": "Respiratory Distress Syndrome"}, {"head": "full-term infants", "relation": "can be affected by", "tail": "Respiratory Distress Syndrome"}, {"head": "babies who weigh less than 3 pounds at birth", "relation": "are more likely to have", "tail": "Respiratory Distress Syndrome"}, {"head": "infants whose mothers have diabetes", "relation": "are more likely to have", "tail": "Respiratory Distress Syndrome"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "a baby's first breath", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: lungs to expand]"}, {"head": "the alveoli are kept open by", "relation": "are maintained by", "tail": "[Event: a baby's first breath]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: prolonged lack of oxygen in the blood]", "relation": "may lead to", "tail": "[Event: permanent damage to brain or lungs]"}, {"head": "[Event: increasing difficulty breathing]", "relation": "can lead to", "tail": "[Event: life-threatening deficiency of oxygen in the blood]"}]}, "status": "success"}

If either looks yellow, the doctor will order blood tests to measure the levels of bilirubin, red blood cells, and liver enzymes in the child's blood. In some cases, a doctor will recommend an ultrasound scan (see page 111) or X-rays to examine the child's liver and bile ducts. In addition, a doctor may order blood tests to check for possible underlying causes of jaundice, such as Rh incompatibility.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nMost cases of physiologic jaundice clear up on their own without treatment. Mild cases of hemolytic jaundice also usually disappear without treatment. Feeding the infant stimulates the passage of meconium (the first bowel movement of a newborn) and the transition to normal stool. Bilirubin is excreted in the stool, which helps lower the levels of bilirubin in the blood.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > **Treating neonatal jaundice**]\nIf your baby needs phototherapy for jaundice, you may be able to give the treatment at home. A visiting nurse can teach you how to use the phototherapy equipment and will monitor your baby during daily visits to your home. For the treatment, ultraviolet light is delivered through a fiberoptic panel fitted into a cotton flannel sleeve that wraps around the baby like a wide belt. You can hold, feed, and change your baby while the belt is on. The longer the belt is worn each day, the faster the child's bilirubin reaches a safe level. The process usually takes 3 to 4 days.\n\n![Illustration of a woman holding a baby, with a medical device (likely a phototherapy machine) connected to the baby's arm, indicating treatment for jaundice.]()![](_page_682_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nFor obstructive jaundice, surgery to correct the blockage in the outflow of bile and bilirubin from the liver must be performed to prevent fatal liver damage, which can occur within a few months without treatment. In some cases, when the blood level of bilirubin is high, a doctor may perform phototherapy (light therapy), in which the baby is exposed to ultraviolet light to help convert the bilirubin into a form that will pass easily out of the liver, into the urine, and out of the body. Severe cases of jaundice, especially hemolytic jaundice, are treated by an exchange blood transfusion, in which all the baby's blood is replaced with donated blood.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Feeding Problems]\nMany babies cry for a few minutes after breastfeeding or bottle feeding. If your baby cries after feeding, cuddle and comfort him or her; if your baby has had enough to eat, he or she will soon stop crying and fall asleep. If your baby continues to cry, or cries a lot between feedings, he or she may not be getting enough breast milk or formula. Try giving your baby more but do not force him or her. Babies stop eating when they have had enough. Some babies cry because they are thirsty, especially in hot weather. Try giving your baby some water. If your baby begins to fuss soon after starting a bottle, he or she may be frustrated because the nipple hole is too small or clogged. If this occurs, substitute another nipple.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Poor Feeding*]\nIn the first few weeks of life, some babies fall asleep while feeding. Babies this age generally eat small amounts but need to eat frequently throughout the day and night (sometimes as often as every 2 or 3 hours). This is normal. In a healthy baby, this phase usually passes after about a month. Offer the baby the breast or bottle when he or she wakes up or when he or she cries, but don't force the baby to feed if he or she turns away. If this pattern of feeding continues or if the baby seems lethargic or seems to be losing weight, see your pediatrician. Your child's doctor will determine if your baby is getting enough milk or formula by checking his or her weight and growth pattern.\n\nYou also should contact your doctor if your baby feeds slowly or does not seem to be eating as much as usual.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Poor Feeding* > *Spitting Up or Vomiting After Feeding*]\nMost babies spit up a little milk or formula after feeding, particularly when they burp. Bottle-fed babies are more likely to spit up because they are more likely to swallow air when feeding, which can overfill the stomach. Some very active babies spit up a lot; this is usually not a cause for concern. Most babies gradually stop spitting up when they are about 4 to 6 months old, after they start eating solid food. Spitting up usually stops completely by 9 months. Changing the baby's feeding position and keeping the baby upright after feeding may help.\n\nIf your baby is vomiting large amounts, if the vomit contains blood or a greenish brown material, or if the vomit is expelled to some distance (called projectile vomiting) more than two or three times a day, contact your pediatrician right away.

Diaper rash can also result from chafing or from a bacterial or yeast infection (thrush; see page 539). Sometimes the condition is an allergic reaction to chemical irritants such as soap, detergent, or fabric softener, or to synthetic materials in disposable diapers.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptom of diaper rash is red, spotty, sore, moist skin in the area that is usually covered by a diaper. The rash is painful and can range from mild to severe.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nDiaper rash is easily diagnosed by its appearance and is easy to treat at home. Expose the rash area to warm, dry air for as long as possible throughout the day—take the baby's diaper off and lay him or her face down on soft towels placed over a waterproof sheet. Clean up any stool or urine immediately, and bathe the rash with warm water and a mild soap. Change the towels as often as necessary. Afterward, pat the affected area dry with a soft, clean towel. Diaper the baby at bedtime.\n\nYour doctor may recommend gently cleansing the affected area with a cotton ball soaked in mineral oil and applying a nonprescription zinc oxide cream or ointment to the rash. If the affected area becomes soiled again, cleanse it again with mineral oil and reapply the cream.\n\nIf the rash is persistent or severe, or if it worsens, talk to your doctor. He or she may recommend other ways to treat the rash at home or may prescribe a cream or ointment to help speed healing. Sometimes diaper rash becomes infected with a fungus called candida. If this occurs, doctors usually recommend a nonprescription antifungal cream or ointment to clear it up.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > **Cradle Cap**]\nCradle cap is a common, harmless skin condition that affects an infant's scalp, usually during the first 3 to 6 months of life. Cradle cap, which results from a buildup of oil and dead skin cells, is the most common form of seborrheic dermatitis (see page 1063). The thin, dry scales of cradle cap cause no discomfort for the child.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > *Symptoms*]\nThe initial symptom of cradle cap is the appearance of thin, dry, red, scaly patches on the scalp. The scales eventually become yellow, greasy, crusty patches that can cover the entire scalp and sometimes extend over the eyebrows and behind the ears. Some babies may temporarily lose some hair in the affected area.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nTo diagnose cradle cap, a doctor will examine the baby's scalp. If your baby has cradle cap, keep the affected area clean and dry by washing it with mild soap and water and drying it gently but thoroughly with a soft, clean towel. If cradle cap is unsightly, your doctor will recommend rubbing the affected areas gently with unscented baby oil or mineral oil and leaving the oil on for a few hours or overnight to loosen the scales. Later, comb the hair gently with a fine-tooth comb to loosen the scales; wash the scales away with a mild shampoo. If the condition recurs, repeat the treatment.\n\nIf cradle cap worsens or becomes itchy, or if the scaly patches become soft and begin to ooze yellowish pus, talk to your doctor. These may be symptoms of an infection that requires immediate treatment. Your doctor will prescribe a topical antibiotic ointment to apply to the skin to help relieve the baby's symptoms and clear up the infection.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Colic**]\nColic is a common condition in which a baby has episodes of loud, continuous, inconsolable crying with no apparent cause. The condition usually begins when a baby is 2 to 4 weeks old and continues for 2 to 3 months. Episodes of colic usually begin suddenly in the late afternoon or early evening, and last for 3 hours or more. The cause of colic is not known.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptoms of colic are daily episodes of loud, inconsolable crying that last for several hours. The baby may also have a swollen, tight abdomen, and he or she may clench his or her hands and bring the knees up to the chest. The baby's face may be flushed, but the area around his or her mouth may be pale. Episodes usually end after the baby falls asleep from exhaustion, or when he or she has a bowel movement or passes gas.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of colic is based on the baby's symptoms. There is no specific treatment for colic, and the condition usually clears up on its own by the time a baby is about 3 months old. Until then, the best way to deal with the problem is to try to comfort or\n\ndistract the baby without overstimulating him or her. Some babies with colic seem to feel better if they sleep in a quiet room, are handled very gently, and get a lot of attention from their parents.

A heart defect that is present from birth (congenital) may be so minor that it requires no treatment, and has no effect on a child's health. Other congenital heart defects may be so severe that immediate treatment is necessary to save the child's life.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > How Heart Defects Develop]\nThe heart of a fetus starts to develop early in pregnancy and is fully developed by the third month of pregnancy. Any disturbance in development during this critical period (such as a rubella infection; see page 508) can cause a heart defect. The cause of the vast majority of congenital heart abnormalities is unknown. In most cases, both genes and environmental factors are thought to interact to produce the defect, but specific environmental factors usually cannot be identified.\n\nAlthough most congenital heart defects occur in otherwise healthy infants, they also can be present in children with broader genetic disorders such as Down syndrome (see page 955), Marfan syndrome (see page 967), or Turner syndrome (see page 957). An ultrasound (see page 510) of the fetus is often part of a prenatal examination during the first few months of pregnancy and provides a picture of the internal organs, including the heart. The doctor studies the fetus's heart on the ultrasound and, if he or she suspects an abnormality, will recommend a more specialized test called a fetal cardiac ultrasound to get a more detailed image of the anatomy of the fetus's heart.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > How Heart Defects Develop > Birth Defects]\nAbnormalities that are present in a child at birth are called birth defects or congenital abnormalities. Although they are present at birth, their effects may not become apparent until later in life. Birth defects can result from genetic or environmental factors or both. For many, the cause is unknown.\n\nFor most birth defects, the earlier a child is treated, the better the outcome for his or her development and physical and emotional health. In addition to medical treatment, a child who has a birth defect can often benefit from counseling by a mental health professional who can help him or her deal with the challenges presented by his or her abnormality. If your child has a birth defect, you might also benefit from counseling; ask your doctor to recommend a counselor or support group that can put you in touch with other parents who have a child with a similar birth defect.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > How Heart Defects Develop > *Symptoms of Congenital Heart Defects*]\nMany cases of congenital heart defects produce no symptoms, and the defect is detected during a routine examination of the heart. In some cases, symptoms are obvious. Sometimes symptoms are present at birth, and sometimes they don't develop until childhood or much later. Some congenital heart defects that don't produce symptoms early in life require surgery to prevent problems from developing later.\n\nLack of oxygen in the blood can cause blueness of the skin (cyanosis). Cyanosis is a common sign of congenital heart problems that allow blood lacking oxygen (deoxygenated blood) to circulate through the body. A baby with mild heart failure may have difficulty feeding (because he or she does not have enough energy to suck) and he or she may lose weight and cry less than usual. In severe heart failure, symptoms are more obvious—the child's breathing is rapid and difficult even while resting, and his or her skin may be blue because of the lack of oxygen.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > How Heart Defects Develop > *Diagnosing Congenital Heart Defects*]\nA doctor can usually diagnose a congenital heart defect by examining the heart with a stethoscope, which enables him or her to hear the sounds made by the heart when the pumping chambers of the heart (ventricles) contract and the valves open and close. Sounds of blood flow that occur between the sounds of the valves are called murmurs, which can be normal or the sign of a heart abnormality. A harmless murmur is a common, normal sound of blood flow that can be heard in children after 2 to 3 years of age. These normal murmurs (also called innocent murmurs or functional murmurs) do not require any treatment.\n\nIf the child's doctor has detected a murmur that suggests an abnormality, he or she will refer the child to a pediatric cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in treating heart disorders in children) to diagnose the specific defect and evaluate its severity. Each type of heart defect usually produces a characteristic murmur, or sound. For this reason, a pediatric cardiologist can usually diagnose a specific heart abnormality with a stethoscope. However, more tests, including one or more of the following, are usually performed to confirm the diagnosis:\n\n- **Chest X-ray** An X-ray of the chest can s", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "heart abnormality", "relation": "is the most common type of", "tail": "birth defect"}, {"head": "congenital heart defects", "relation": "may be so minor that it requires no treatment, and has no effect on a child's health", "tail": "a child's health"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "fetus", "relation": "starts to develop", "tail": "[Event: early in pregnancy]"}, {"head": "heart of a fetus", "relation": "is fully developed by", "tail": "[Event: the third month of pregnancy]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: disturbance in development during this critical period]", "relation": "can cause", "tail": "[Event: heart defect]"}, {"head": "[Event: rubella infection]", "relation": "can cause", "tail": "[Event: heart defect]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Small defects do not cause any symptoms and often close on their own. If a baby has a large ventricular septal defect, he or she may develop signs of congestive heart failure, such as rapid breathing, shortness of breath, excessive sweating while feeding, a heart murmur, poor weight gain, and delayed growth.\n\nChildren with atrial septal defects usually have no symptoms, but these defects rarely close on their own. If left untreated, atrial septal defects can progress and cause problems in middle age, including congestive heart failure, arrhythmias (see page 580), and pulmonary hypertension (see page 594).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Septal defects]\nA ventricular septal defect (top) is a hole in the wall (septum) that separates the right and left ventricles. Blood flows abnormally through the hole from the left ventricle into the right ventricle, potentially allowing excess blood to flow to the lungs. An atrial septal defect (bottom) is a hole in the septum that separates the right atrium from the left atrium. This defect also causes the blood to flow abnormally from left to right; if the defect is large enough, too much blood can enter the lungs.\n\nKey\n\n- Oxygenated blood\n- Deoxygenated blood\n- Mixed\n\nDiagram illustrating two types of congenital heart defects:\n\n**Ventricular septal defect (VSD):** Shows a hole in the ventricular septum connecting the Right ventricle and the Left ventricle.

To confirm the diagnosis, the doctor will order additional tests, such as a chest X-ray, an ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram; see page 561), or a recording of the electrical activity of the\n\nheart (electrocardiogram; see page 559). Doctors usually refer children with septal defects to pediatric cardiologists (doctors who specialize in treating heart disorders in children).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > *Treatment*]\nBecause children with any kind of heart defect have a slight risk of developing infections at the site of the defect if bacteria enter the bloodstream, the child's doctor will recommend that the child take antibiotics before having any kind of dental work (including cleanings) or surgery.\n\nIf a baby has a small ventricular septal defect, no treatment is necessary. More than 80 percent of ventricular septal defects close on their own. If a child has a large ventricular septal defect and signs of congestive heart failure, the doctor will prescribe heart medication and a high-calorie diet (because heart failure uses up calories that are necessary for the child's growth and development). If the baby's condition does not improve or if he or she has pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs) or is not growing at the normal rate, the doctor will recommend open heart surgery to repair the defect in the child's first year of life. Surgery is very effective in correcting these defects, enabling a child to grow and develop normally and lead a full, healthy life.\n\nIf an atrial septal defect persists beyond 2 years of age, closure is recommended to avoid future problems. Most defects can be closed using a procedure called catheter device closure. In this procedure a thin flexible tube (catheter) is used to place a metal device in the defect; the device is then locked onto the atrial walls surrounding the defect, closing the hole. Very large defects require open heart surgery. Children who have surgery to close an atrial septal defect can live a full, healthy life and have a normal life span.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > Coarctation of the Aorta]\nCoarctation of the aorta is an abnormal narrowing of the aorta, the major artery leading out of the heart. The narrowing usually occurs just beyond the point where the aorta turns down to supply blood to the lower part of the body, causing blood pressure in the aorta to increase above the narrowing and decrease below the narrowing. As a result, the child develops high blood pressure in the upper portion of the body and low blood\n\npressure in the lower part of the body, and his or her heart has to work harder to pump blood past the narrowing to the rest of the body.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > Coarctation of the aorta]\nIn a healthy heart (left), the aorta is wide enough to allow normal blood flow.

A chest X-ray will show an abnormally shaped heart. The doctor will also order an echocardiogram (see page 561) and an electrocardiogram (see page 559) to identify the abnormalities of tetralogy of Fallot and to rule out other heart defects. The doctor will refer the child to a pediatric cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in treating heart disorders in children) for further evaluation and treatment.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Treatment**]\nA child with tetralogy of Fallot will need to have surgery to correct the defects, usually in the first year of life. Before corrective surgery, the doctor may recommend a temporary solution with a surgical procedure using a special shunt that diverts blood flow to the lungs and relieves the child's immediate symptoms. But, as heart surgery for\n\ninfants evolves, more and more children with tetralogy of Fallot are having the defects repaired early in infancy, eliminating the need for this initial, temporary surgery.\n\nAfter the defects are repaired, the doctor will prescribe antibiotics for the child to take before having any dental work or surgery to prevent a bacterial infection of the heart. After surgery, the child will grow and develop normally, but he or she will need to be examined regularly throughout life by a cardiologist to detect any problems (such as irregular heart rhythms) that could develop.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Patent Ductus Arteriosus]\nPatent ductus arteriosus is a heart defect in which a blood vessel called the ductus arteriosus fails to close after birth. This blood vessel connects the pulmonary artery (which transports blood from the heart to the lungs) and the aorta (the main artery that transports blood from the heart to the body) in the fetus. Because this blood vessel stays open (patent) after birth, some of the blood pumped from the left side of the baby's heart flows back to the lungs instead of to the rest of the body. Through a stethoscope, a doctor will be able to hear a murmur of blood flow through the ductus. Patent ductus arteriosus occurs most often in premature infants but also can occur in full-term babies.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Patent Ductus Arteriosus > Patent ductus arteriosus]\nA fetus's heart has a channel called the ductus arteriosus, which connects the pulmonary artery and the aorta. Because the fetus receives oxygen from the mother's placenta and umbilical cord, the channel allows blood to bypass the lungs. Normally, the channel closes shortly after birth to allow blood to flow to the lungs to receive oxygen. In patent ductus arteriosus, the channel stays open (patent), allowing oxygenated blood to flow back from the aorta through the pulmonary artery to the baby's lungs, making the heart work extra hard.\n\nKey\n\n→ Oxygenated blood  \n→ Deoxygenated blood  \n→ Mixed\n\n![Diagram comparing a Healthy heart and a heart with Patent ductus arteriosus.

A large opening can cause an infant to breathe rapidly and have shortness of breath, a very strong pulse, difficulty feeding, poor weight gain, and frequent chest infections. He or she may also be irritable.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosis]\nDoctors can diagnose patent ductus arteriosus by listening for a heart murmur through a stethoscope. To confirm the diagnosis, a doctor will recommend additional tests, such as a chest X-ray, an echocardiogram (see page 561), or an electrocardiogram (see page 559).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Treatment]\nThe doctor will first administer a medication called indomethacin intravenously (through a vein) to close the ductus in a premature infant. He or she will also give the baby diuretics to reduce the fluid levels in his or her body by increasing urination. The baby's intake of fluids will be limited to prevent fluid buildup.\n\nIf this treatment is not successful, if the baby is full term, or if patent ductus arteriosus is diagnosed in an older infant or child, the doctor will recommend a cardiac catheterization procedure (see page 592) to close the ductus. In this procedure, the ductus is closed off with coils inserted through a thin, flexible tube (catheter) that is threaded into the heart through an artery or vein. In rare cases, surgery (performed through an incision under the left arm) is necessary to close off the ductus.

His or her pulse is weak and the skin is cold, and he or she may have difficulty breathing. Within hours or days, a newborn will become critically ill and die unless he or she is given immediate care.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf a newborn develops symptoms in the hospital nursery, a doctor usually will diagnose the problem with a chest X-ray, an ultrasound examination of the heart (echocardiogram; see page 561), or a recording of the electrical activity of the heart (electrocardiogram; see page 559). If your baby shows any symptoms of hypoplastic left heart syndrome after leaving the hospital, take him or her to the nearest hospital emergency department immediately. He or she will need to be cared for at a medical center that has extensive experience treating babies with this type of heart defect.\n\nAt the hospital, the doctor will stabilize the baby with intravenous heart and blood pressure medications. The baby will need to have surgery within days to enable the right side of his or her heart to pump blood to the rest of the body and to insert a shunt to allow blood to flow to his or her lungs from the pulmonary artery. A second operation is done at about 6 to 12 months of age and a third one between ages 2 and 4. Even after these operations, a child's heart will not be normal; he or she always will need medication to keep the heart functioning well and will need to see a pediatric cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in treating heart disorders in children) regularly. If the three-stage surgery is not recommended in your child's case, a heart transplant to save your child's life is an option, provided a compatible donor heart is available.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Neural Tube Defects]\nThe central nervous system (see page 666), which includes the brain and spinal cord, develops in the fetus within the first 2 months of pregnancy from a strip of cells that runs along the back of the embryo. The edges of the strip gradually curl inward to form a tube of cells. The front part of this tube expands to form the brain; the back part of the tube forms the spinal cord. A liquid (called cerebrospinal fluid) produced by the brain forms inside and around the brain and spinal cord to cushion them. Bone cells develop into the\n\nskull and spinal column, which provide more protection for the brain and spinal cord.\n\nNeural tube defects—in which the brain, spinal column, or spinal cord is malformed—are disorders of the central nervous system that are present at birth (congenital). Neural tube defects are linked to a deficiency of the B vitamin folic acid in a pregnant woman. During the first few weeks of pregnancy, which are crucial to the development of the fetus's central nervous system, many women do not know they are pregnant. Most cases of neural tube defects could be prevented if women of child-bearing age who might become pregnant would take 400 micrograms of folic acid (in a supplement or in a multivitamin) every day before they become pregnant and throughout their pregnancy (especially during the early weeks).\n\nNeural tube defects can run in families. If a couple has one affected child, or relatives who have a child with a neural tube defect, they should talk to a genetic counselor (see page 952) about their risks of having another child with the abnormality and to learn how they can prevent it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Spina Bifida]\nIn a neural tube defect called spina bifida, part of the spinal column does not develop fully, leaving the nerves of the spinal cord in that area exposed and unprotected. The disorder usually affects the bones (vertebrae) in the lower spine and the meninges (the membranes covering the spinal cord). The spinal nerves in that area control the leg muscles, bladder, and intestines. The extent of physical disability depends on the severity of the spinal defect.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Spina Bifida > *Symptoms*]\nThe defect in the lower spine and the resulting damage to the spinal cord and symptoms can vary widely. The mildest form of spina bifida, called spina bifida occulta, is not technically a neural tube defect because only the vertebrae are malformed—the spinal cord and meninges remain inside the spinal column. The only visible sign of spina bifida occulta may be a small dimple in the skin, a birth-mark, or a wisp of hair over the lower spine. In some children, the spine has an abnormal curve. In rare cases, a child with spina bifida occulta has a physical impairment.\n\nIn the most severe and most common form of spina bifida (meningomyelocele), the meninges and spinal cord are exposed on the child's back. In another form, known as a meningocele, a bulging sac containing the meninges appears on the child's back.

This fluid is produced by the brain and passes into the space around the brain, where it is absorbed into a membrane surrounding the space. If too much fluid is produced, if the membrane is abnormal in a developing fetus, or if the flow of cerebrospinal fluid is blocked, the fluid builds up in the cavities of the brain. This fluid buildup can put pressure on the brain, which can cause the brain to swell, spreading apart the loosely connected bones of the skull and causing the child's head to become larger than normal.\n\nHydrocephalus sometimes occurs with spina bifida (see page 398). In premature infants, hydrocephalus can occur from bleeding in the brain. If hydrocephalus is well advanced at birth, the brain can be damaged severely, limiting a child's physical and mental development and, in some cases, resulting in death. Hydrocephalus can occur later in infancy as a result of damage to the brain from an infection or a tumor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nA doctor may suspect that a newborn has hydrocephalus if the circumference of his or her head is significantly larger than average for his or her overall size or if the head is growing too rapidly. If the doctor suspects hydrocephalus, he or she will measure the baby's head periodically. If the rate of growth of the head is greater than normal for the baby's age and size, the doctor probably will order an ultrasound scan (see page 111), an MRI (see page 113), or a CT scan (see page 112) to help make a diagnosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nHydrocephalus is treated surgically. The infant is given general anesthesia, and the surgeon drills a small hole in the infant's skull. The doctor inserts a tube with a one-way valve into the hole, extending it into the ventricle (a natural space in the brain). He or she then inserts the other end into the child's abdomen or into a major blood vessel leading into the heart. Fluid then drains from the brain through the tube into the abdomen or bloodstream. Placement of the tube is permanent.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > **Hydrocephalus**]\nAt birth, the bones of the skull are slightly separated (top left), and you can feel a soft spot called the fontanelle on the top of the child's head. The bones grow together by age 2. In a child with hydrocephalus, the buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the cavities of the brain causes the brain to swell and spread the skull bones farther apart (bottom right), enlarging the child's head.\n\nDiagram illustrating the difference between a Normal skull and a Skull in hydrocephalus.\n\n- **Normal skull:** Shows the separation of bones and the soft spot (Fontanelle).\n- **Skull in hydrocephalus:** Shows the bones spread farther apart, indicating increased pressure.\n\n![](_page_713_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Treating hydrocephalus]\nTo relieve pressure on the brain from the accumulation of fluid in hydrocephalus, a surgeon may insert a permanent tube (called a shunt) into the child's head to drain the fluid from the brain into the child's abdomen or into a vein in the neck. The tube usually remains in place for life.\n\nDiagram illustrating the surgical procedure for treating hydrocephalus, showing a Ventricular catheter inserted into the brain and a Peritoneal catheter draining fluid from the brain into the abdomen.\n\n- Ventricular catheter inserted into brain\n- One-way valve\n- Peritoneal catheter draining fluid from the brain into the abdomen\n\n![](_page_713_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\nAfter the surgery, the baby's head will gradually return to a normal size. During the first year, he or she will need to have frequent checkups. When children with\n\nhydrocephalus have this surgery early in life, their chances of normal mental and physical development are good.\n\nIn some cases, as the child grows, the tube becomes blocked, causing pressure to build up in the brain. If this occurs, the child will be irritable, vomit frequently, or develop a headache and fever. If you notice these symptoms in your child, take him or her to the doctor or to a hospital emergency department immediately. If the tube in your child's brain is blocked, he or she will be hospitalized and the blockage will be removed or the tube replaced.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Other Congenital Disorders]\nSome birth defects are inherited. Others can result from an abnormality that occurs during fetal development. In most cases, the earlier a child is treated, the more successful the outcome, especially for disorders that can affect a child's development. For example, congenital dislocation of the hip can interfere with a child's learning to walk, and cleft lip and cleft palate can affect a child's ability to speak and can make eating difficult.

Many babies with normally formed feet persistently turn them inward, but their feet can be manipulated back into the proper position. A clubfoot cannot be placed in the proper position. Clubfoot may run in families and is more common in boys than in girls. In rare cases, clubfoot is linked to other birth defects. Nearly all cases of clubfoot are detected at birth and treated, enabling the child to learn to walk normally.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nA clubfoot usually turns down and in. It is seldom painful, but it affects a child's ability to stand and walk. If not treated, the child cannot move the foot normally and walks on the side or top of the foot.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA doctor usually can diagnose clubfoot from a physical examination and X-rays. If a clubfoot is minor, the doctor will show the parents how to manipulate the child's foot regularly each day until, as the bones and ligaments develop, the foot settles into a normal position. In more severe cases, the doctor will refer the child to an orthopedic specialist. The orthopedist will manipulate the foot into as close to normal a position as\n\npossible and put a splint or plaster cast on it to hold it in place. Every 2 days, and then at 2-week intervals, the orthopedist will remove the splints or cast, manipulate the child's foot closer to its normal position, and put new splints or a new cast on the foot to hold it in the new position. This treatment takes about 3 to 6 months, after which the child wears corrective shoes. If these measures do not correct the problem, surgery may be necessary.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Clubfoot]\nClubfoot is a birth defect in which a child's foot is twisted or turned out of its normal position, usually down and in. One or both feet may be affected.\n\n![Illustration of a foot showing the characteristic deformity of clubfoot, where the foot is twisted and turned outwards.]()![](_page_718_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate]\nA cleft lip is a vertical split in the upper lip that may be partial or extend up to the base of the nose. In some children who have a cleft lip, the nose appears to be flattened. Some children have two splits that can affect both sides of their upper lip, or a gap that continues along the roof of their mouth (the palate). This gap, called a cleft palate, runs along the middle of the palate and extends from behind the teeth to the cavity of the nose. A child with a cleft palate has difficulty eating and swallowing. A newborn may regurgitate milk through the nose. If not treated, the appearance of the cleft lip can cause emotional distress for the child, and an untreated cleft palate can cause serious speech difficulties.\n\nIn most cases, the cause of cleft lip and cleft palate is unknown, but both genetic and nongenetic factors appear to play a role. The abnormalities sometimes can run in families and may affect more than one child in a family. For this reason, if you have a child with a cleft lip or palate, or if you have a repaired cleft, it's a good idea to see a\n\ngenetic counselor (see page 952) to determine your risk of having a child with the same birth defect in the future.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nAll newborns are checked for cleft lip and cleft palate, which are obvious at birth. If a baby has a cleft, the doctor will examine him or her immediately to determine the extent of the defect.\n\nA baby with a cleft lip or cleft palate will need to have corrective surgery. He or she is likely to receive care from a team of specialists, including a pediatrician, speech therapist, orthodontist (a dentist who specializes in correcting irregularities of the teeth), pediatric dentist, plastic surgeon, and otolaryngologist (a doctor who specializes in disorders of the ear, nose, and throat).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment* > **Cleft lip and cleft palate**]\nA cleft lip (above left) can vary in severity from a notch in the upper lip to a split extending to the base of the nose. It can occur on one or both sides of the nose. In some cases, a cleft lip extends into the roof of the mouth (palate), forming a cleft palate (above right). A cleft palate also may occur alone.\n\n![Three diagrams illustrating cleft conditions. The top left shows a Cleft lip. The top right shows a Cleft lip and cleft palate.

Because a baby does not use its digestive system until after he or she is born, malformations of the digestive system that occur during fetal development do not affect the baby until after delivery.\n\nThe two main types of malformations that can affect an infant's digestive system are stenosis (narrowing of a tube or duct, sometimes almost to the point of closing) and atresia (blockage in a tube or duct that separates it into two distinct, sealed-off sections). The causes of these defects are not known.\n\nAlthough any abnormality in the digestive system can affect an infant's ability to digest food and absorb nutrients, these abnormalities also can pose some other risks. For example, in digestive system disorders that cause vomiting, a baby may inhale the vomit, which can lead to choking or pneumonia. Disorders that cause vomiting and diarrhea can lead to life-threatening dehydration.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Meckel's Diverticulum]\nMeckel's diverticulum is a congenital (present at birth) disorder in which an abnormal sac, usually lined with gastric (stomach) tissue, forms near the final part of the small intestine (ileum). Meckel's diverticulum occurs in about 1 in 50 children and affects more males than females. The disorder usually does not cause symptoms unless the diverticulum is obstructed, infected, or bleeds from sores in the diverticulum. Stomach acid from the stomach tissue causes the sores, which can bleed severely. If inflammation is severe, the sac can rupture and cause an abscess (a pus-filled cavity) or inflammation of the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritonitis; see page 759). Sometimes Meckel's diverticulum causes a condition called intussusception (see next page), in which the intestine folds back on itself like a telescope. Intussusception occurs more often in infants and young children than in adults.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nThe symptoms of Meckel's diverticulum include bleeding from the rectum (the blood is dark reddish brown) and sometimes abdominal pain or vomiting, or, rarely, fever. The condition can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are similar to those of other disorders such as an intestinal obstruction (see right), appendicitis (see page 771), or a perforated duodenal ulcer (see page 755).\n\nIf a person has symptoms of Meckel's diverticulum, the doctor will order a radionuclide scan (see page 114) to see if stomach tissue is in the diverticulum, and a blood test to check for anemia (see page 610). If the radionuclide scan does not show\n\nMeckel's diverticulum, more imaging tests will be done to determine the cause of the symptoms.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTo treat Meckel's diverticulum, doctors first stop any intestinal bleeding and treat the anemia. Once the bleeding has stopped and the anemia is reduced, the person undergoes surgery to remove the diverticulum and correct any problems such as intussusception. A doctor may prescribe antibiotics to prevent or treat complications such as peritonitis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Intestinal Obstruction**]\nIntestinal obstruction occurs when the small or large intestine is partially or completely blocked, preventing food and waste from passing through the intestines. The problem can result from a number of disorders of the digestive system.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Intestinal Obstruction** > **Pyloric stenosis**]\nPyloric stenosis is a congenital disorder in which the muscular walls of the pylorus—the outlet from the stomach to the duodenum (the first section of the small intestine)—thicken, which narrows the passageway inside and prevents food from moving from the stomach into the intestines. Pyloric stenosis usually occurs between 2 and 8 weeks after birth and is more common in boys than in girls. The disorder often runs in families. The most common symptoms are choking and vomiting after feeding.\n\nThe baby may be irritable and restless and may begin to lose weight. If not treated, pyloric stenosis can lead to dehydration, pneumonia caused by inhaled vomit, or malnutrition, or can be fatal. To treat the disorder, surgery is performed to widen the pylorus to allow food to pass through.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Intestinal Obstruction** > **Intestinal atresia**]\nIn intestinal atresia, an infant is born with one or more parts of the small intestine missing or shriveled into a useless cord. The main symptom of intestinal atresia is intermittent vomiting of bile (a digestive fluid produced by the liver) beginning within a few hours of birth. The baby has no bowel movements, and his or her abdomen swells as gas builds up in the intestines.

Part of the liver, spleen, or stomach or part of the large and small intestines may protrude through the opening into the chest and press on one of the lungs (usually the left lung), causing breathing difficulties. In severe cases, the baby's skin may turn blue (cyanosis) from lack of oxygen and the baby may be placed on a ventilator to assist with breathing until surgery is performed.\n\nSurgery (which is done as soon as possible) involves opening the chest and pushing the protruding organs back into the abdominal cavity and stitching up the diaphragm. Many infants with a diaphragmatic hernia die before or after surgery because their lungs are significantly underdeveloped and they cannot breathe, even with assistance from a ventilator. After surgery, the infant may be placed on a heart-lung machine, which removes carbon dioxide from the blood and supplies adequate oxygen. This procedure enables the diaphragm to rest and heal and improves the infant's chances of survival.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragmatic hernia > **Surgical adhesions**]\nAfter abdominal surgery, scar tissue called adhesions may form in the abdomen and bind segments of the intestines together, causing an obstruction. The symptoms of surgical adhesions include abdominal swelling, cramping, and pain. The usual treatment for adhesions is surgery to cut the scar tissue to release the segments of intestine that are bound together.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragmatic hernia > **Paralytic ileus**]\nAfter an infection or surgery, the intestine can become paralyzed, losing its ability to move waste to the rectum. The intestine becomes stretched as it fills with fluid, waste, and air, causing inflammation and pain in the abdomen. Paralytic ileus can lead to fecal impaction, in which hardened stool becomes lodged in the intestine. To treat paralytic ileus, the doctor inserts a flexible tube through the child's nose and down into his or her intestine to remove fluid, waste, and air. The child is given nothing by mouth and is fed intravenously (through a vein) until gas or stool is passed and intestinal function returns to normal.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragmatic hernia > **Esophageal Atresia**]\nEsophageal atresia is a rare birth defect that interferes with an infant's ability to eat and breathe. In esophageal atresia, the part of the esophagus that leads from the mouth is not fully developed and does not reach the stomach. As a result, the infant cannot swallow food or secretions (saliva and mucus), and they can enter the windpipe, partially blocking it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragmatic hernia > **Esophageal atresia**]\nIn esophageal atresia, the esophagus (which moves food from the mouth to the stomach) is not fully developed, and there is no passageway into the stomach. Surgery is performed as soon as possible to join the separated sections of the esophagus.\n\n![Diagram illustrating esophageal atresia. The esophagus is shown as a tube connecting the upper part of the body to the stomach. The tube is blocked or closed at the junction with the stomach, labeled 'Atresia'.]()![](_page_727_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragmatic hernia > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptom of esophageal atresia is continuous bubbling noises from the infant's throat. Sometimes, if the airways are obstructed, the baby's skin turns blue from lack of oxygen. When a doctor removes the secretions with a suction tube, the symptoms disappear temporarily, but return as soon as the secretions build up again. When the baby eats, he or she may cough, gag, choke, or vomit. If your child has any of these symptoms, talk to your doctor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragmatic hernia > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of esophageal atresia is based on the baby's symptoms and a physical examination. The doctor may look for esophageal atresia by trying to pass a soft tube down the baby's esophagus. The diagnosis is confirmed with X-rays. An infant with this disorder cannot be given food or liquids by mouth and is fed intravenously (through a vein) until the condition is corrected. Surgery is performed in one or more stages to open and join the two separate sections of the esophagus, which usually eliminates the problem. After surgery, a tube may be inserted temporarily into the repaired portion of the esophagus to dilate (widen) the esophagus and hold it open.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragmatic hernia > **Biliary Atresia**]\nBiliary atresia (also called bile duct atresia) is a rare congenital (present from birth) disorder in which parts of the bile ducts (the tubes that carry a digestive fluid called bile from the liver to the small intestine) are either malformed or absent.

Cerebral palsy may be congenital (present from birth), or it may develop after birth. The disorder cannot be cured, but it does not worsen as the child gets older.\n\nFor most children who have cerebral palsy, the exact cause is unknown. The majority of cases result from brain injury during fetal development. Brain injury during delivery, an infection of the brain, or a head injury can also cause cerebral palsy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of cerebral palsy can range from mild to severe, can differ from child to child, and can change over time. In most cases, lack of normal muscle tone and muscle control makes it difficult for an affected child to maintain balance and to coordinate and control his or her movements. A baby with cerebral palsy may have difficulty sucking and swallowing. Normal developmental milestones (see page 377), such as rolling over, sitting, crawling, smiling, speaking, and walking, usually are delayed. Muscle stiffness, spasms, or poor muscle tone in the arms and legs cause many children with cerebral palsy to adopt unusual body postures or to perform involuntary limb, body, mouth, tongue, or facial movements. Because the brain damage that causes cerebral palsy can disrupt the electrical activity of the brain, some children have seizures (see page 686).\n\nSome children with cerebral palsy have vision, hearing, or speech problems. Many affected children have normal intelligence but may have a learning disability. About half of all children with cerebral palsy have some degree of mental retardation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose cerebral palsy, a doctor takes a complete medical history and performs a physical examination that includes testing a child's motor skills and reflexes. The doctor will ask you to describe how well your child can move about and will ask you questions to determine if your child has reached specific developmental milestones, such as sitting, crawling, standing, or walking. The doctor may recommend blood tests, genetic tests, a CT scan (see page 112), or an MRI (see page 113) to help make a diagnosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTreatment for cerebral palsy focuses on helping the child overcome the disabilities caused by the disorder (or minimizing their effects) so the child can reach his or her full potential. After evaluating the type and extent of a child's disabilities, the doctor will recommend appropriate measures, such as special education, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, or counseling.\n\nSpeech therapy can improve the child's ability to speak and swallow. In some cases, a feeding tube may be needed to help ensure proper nutrition and to help prevent food from entering and blocking the airway. Surgery is sometimes performed to correct bone and joint deformities, enabling some children to walk with braces, crutches, or a walker. Some doctors prescribe muscle-relaxing medication to control involuntary movements and to make movement easier. These medications can be given by mouth, injected directly into the muscles, or delivered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord). Doctors also may prescribe anticonvulsants to help prevent seizures. Surgery performed on certain spinal nerves may help decrease stiffness. Hearing problems can be improved with hearing aids (see page 1018). The doctor may recommend prescription eyeglasses or surgery to correct misaligned eyes (see page 1055).\n\nA child who has cerebral palsy should be examined regularly by a doctor to monitor his or her general physical and mental progress. Your doctor can recommend steps you can take to help your child reach his or her full potential and to enhance the quality of his or her life. Caring for a child with cerebral palsy can be demanding and stressful. Ask your doctor or a hospital social worker about support groups and other organizations that can help you and your child.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Febrile Seizures]\nA febrile seizure is a disturbance in the electrical activity of the brain caused by the rapid onset of a high fever in infants and children. Febrile seizures are very common, affecting 4 to 10 percent of all children between ages 6 months and 5 years. Febrile seizures can be simple or complex. A simple febrile seizure, the most common type, lasts 1 to 5 minutes and affects the entire body. Complex febrile seizures last longer than 15 minutes, affect only one side of the body, and can occur more than once in 24 hours.\n\nChildren who have had a febrile seizure have a 30 percent chance of having another one within the next 6 months.", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "cerebral palsy", "relation": "caused by", "tail": "faulty development of or damage to the areas of the brain that control muscle movement"}, {"head": "cerebral palsy", "relation": "resulting in", "tail": "weakness of the arms and legs accompanied by stiffness (called spasticity) or floppiness and, sometimes, unusual body postures"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "brain injury during fetal development", "relation": "results in", "tail": "[Event: cerebral palsy]"}, {"head": "brain injury during delivery", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: cerebral palsy]"}, {"head": "infection of the brain", "relation": "can cause", "tail": "[Event: cerebral palsy]"}, {"head": "head injury", "relation": "can cause", "tail": "[Event: cerebral palsy]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: brain injury during fetal development]", "relation": "results in", "tail": "[Event: cerebral palsy]"}, {"head": "[Event: brain injury during delivery]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: cerebral palsy]"}]}, "status": "success"}

A child with Reye's syndrome will have low sugar levels and elevated levels of ammonia and liver enzymes in the blood. The clotting time of the blood also is tested; the blood may take longer than normal to clot. The doctor will feel your child's abdomen to check for swelling of the liver. He or she may order a liver biopsy (in which samples of cells are taken from the liver and examined under a microscope) to see if the liver is damaged, and an electroencephalogram (EEG; see page 687), an examination of the electrical activity of the brain, to evaluate brain function. The doctor also may order CT scans (see page 112) or MRIs (see page 113) to assess swelling of\n\nthe brain and liver, and a lumbar puncture (see page 693) to examine the spinal fluid to rule out disorders such as meningitis (see page 692).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > *Treatment*]\nA child with Reye's syndrome is hospitalized and given fluids intravenously (through a vein) to replace those lost from vomiting, to restore the balance of electrolytes (essential minerals that help regulate various body processes) in the blood, and to reduce swelling. Brain swelling is also controlled with medication. Pressure monitors may be implanted in the brain to evaluate brain swelling. The child's electrolyte levels, blood glucose (sugar) levels, and blood clotting also are monitored. If necessary, the child may be given medication to maintain adequate blood pressure. If the child has difficulty breathing, he or she may be placed on a ventilator (an artificial breathing machine).\n\nRecovery depends on the severity of the condition. Children who have a mild episode of Reye's syndrome may recover fully in about a week, with no lasting effects. Children who survive a severe episode of Reye's syndrome may have permanent brain damage.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > **Tourette Syndrome**]\nTourette syndrome is a nervous system disorder characterized by sudden, repeated, involuntary movements and vocal sounds called tics. Unlike other tic disorders, the tics of Tourette syndrome often occur along with certain behavior disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; see page 730) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (see page 720). Children with Tourette syndrome often have anxiety (see page 718) or depression (see page 709) and may have a tendency to physically injure themselves. Other behavior disorders that commonly accompany Tourette syndrome are poor impulse control, poor anger control, and antisocial behavior. Such behavior problems can interfere with school performance and social interactions even more than the tics.\n\nTourette syndrome usually begins between 2 and 15 years of age, and the tics become the most extreme at about age 10. The tics usually lessen as the child gets older; by age 18, half of all affected people no longer have tics. In some people, the disorder is lifelong, and 10 percent of affected people have more severe symptoms in adulthood than in childhood. Estimates of the prevalence of Tourette syndrome range from less\n\nthan 1 percent to 4 percent of the population, affecting three times as many boys as girls. The disorder tends to run in families.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe tics of Tourette syndrome that involve body movement (motor tics) often include blinking, nose twitching, muscle tensing, mouth opening, shoulder rotation, head shaking, or bending of the trunk. Examples of more extreme motor tics are hitting, jumping, kicking, making obscene gestures, or imitating the gestures of others. Typical vocal tics include sniffing, throat clearing, grunting, or blowing. Some affected children repeat their own words or the words of others or shout profanities or other inappropriate words or phrases. Many children with Tourette syndrome say that these body movements or utterances are preceded by feelings of anxiety or uncomfortable sensations so severe that they can be relieved only by the expression of the tic.\n\nMost children with Tourette syndrome also display the hallmark symptoms of ADHD (inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (intrusive thoughts that trigger compulsive and repetitive actions). Their poor impulse control and inability to control anger can lead to outbursts of temper and aggressive behavior. Some children with the disorder injure themselves by biting, scratching, hitting, or banging their head.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nDoctors diagnose Tourette syndrome from a thorough medical history, a physical examination, and the observation of tics.

If your child has problems sleeping, talk to your doctor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Do Not Give Sleep Medication to Children > Nightmares]\nNightmares are frightening dreams that usually occur late at night when a child is in deep sleep. When a child has a nightmare, he or she wakes up frightened and may scream or cry. Although children of all ages have occasional nightmares, children between ages 3 and 6 experience them the most. Nightmares usually occur after a child has witnessed a disturbing incident, heard a scary story, or watched a frightening movie or television program. Occasionally, nightmares signal that a child is experiencing unresolved stress caused by problems at home or at school.\n\nThe best way to deal with nightmares is to comfort your child. Turn the lights on to reassure your child that it was only a dream. Hug your child, and take his or her mind off the disturbance by speaking soothingly about something pleasant. Reassure your child that nothing will harm him or her. If your child has frequent, recurring nightmares, try leaving a night-light on in his or her room. To try to find out what the underlying problem is, ask him or her to talk about it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Do Not Give Sleep Medication to Children > Comfort for nightmares]\nIf your child wakes up frightened and crying from a nightmare, comfort and reassure him or her. Stay with your child until he or she is calm and ready to go back to sleep.\n\n![Illustration of a man comforting a child who is lying in bed, looking frightened, while the man gently strokes the child's head.]()![](_page_739_Picture_7.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Night terrors]\nA night terror is another type of frightening dream that occurs most often in children between ages 2 and 5. When a child has a night terror, he or she screams or cries out suddenly during sleep and jumps out of bed. The child looks terrified and may be sweating and breathing rapidly. He or she may talk or babble and have wide-open eyes but is still asleep. The child may not recognize familiar people, such as his or her parents, and may be difficult to wake. Doctors do not know what causes night terrors.\n\nIf your child has a night terror, check to make sure that he or she is not ill or injured. Because the child is still asleep, he or she may not calm down even when you hold or talk to him or her. The child will usually stop crying or screaming after a few minutes.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sleepwalking]\nSleepwalking is a disorder in which changes in the electrical activity of the brain during sleep cause a child to awaken partially during the night. The child may sit up in bed and perform repetitive movements or may get out of bed and walk around. He or she will not respond to others.\n\nIf your child is sleepwalking, do not wake him or her. Instead, silently guide your child back to bed. The child will usually fall back into a deep sleep and will not remember the incident. To protect your child, put a gate in his or her bedroom doorway and across the top of any stairs, and close any accessible windows.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sleepwalking > If Your Child Has Sleep Problems]\nMost children outgrow nightmares, night terrors, and sleepwalking before they reach adolescence. Making sure that your child does not get overtired during the day and that he or she gets enough sleep at night may help eliminate these problems. If your child has persistent sleep problems, see your doctor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Learning Disabilities]\nNot all children develop skills at the same rate. Although some children may be slower than others of the same age to develop certain skills, they usually catch up eventually. A learning disability is a significant gap between a person's intelligence and the skills he\n\nor she has achieved at each age. Learning disabilities are neurological disorders in which the brain is unable to correctly process, use, or retrieve information that a person reads or hears.\n\nAlthough the exact cause of learning disabilities is not known, doctors think that they may be caused by disturbances in brain development before birth. Factors that may affect brain development include genes, fetal exposure to drugs (such as alcohol and tobacco) used by a woman during pregnancy, or complications during pregnancy (including preterm delivery; see page 529) that can affect the fetus's developing brain. Exposure to environmental toxins such as lead (see page 425) after birth also can contribute to the development of learning disabilities.\n\nLearning disabilities can affect people of all ages and backgrounds. Many people with learning disabilities are of average or above-average intelligence.

Children with dyscalculia may have difficulty recognizing numbers or symbols, remembering information such as multiplication tables, or understanding concepts such as fractions. They also may have trouble telling time, keeping track of time, or reading maps.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Dysgraphia]\nDysgraphia is a neurological disorder characterized by the inability to write words on a page. A person with dysgraphia may have difficulty spelling, holding a writing instrument, or forming letters or words on a page. Such difficulties can cause the person's handwriting to be distorted or illegible. A child with dysgraphia also may be unable to organize thoughts on paper even though he or she can convey them verbally.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Dyspraxia]\nDyspraxia is a neurological disorder that results from the inability of the brain to properly relay messages to parts of the body. A child who has dyspraxia may seem clumsy or uncoordinated and may have difficulty performing tasks such as dressing or combing his or her hair. He or she may have difficulty reading, writing, or speaking; or may be extremely sensitive to touch. Children with dyspraxia may not be able to understand logic or reason and often behave immaturely.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Dyspraxia > *Diagnosing and treating academic skills disorders*]\nTo diagnose an academic skills disorder, a child will take tests to evaluate his or her reading, writing, and math abilities. The child may also have vision and hearing tests to rule out vision and hearing problems.\n\nThe treatment of academic skills disorders depends on the disorder. For example, a person who has dyslexia can benefit from a language program that teaches him or her to identify sounds. A person who has dyscalculia may benefit from doing real-life math problems such as counting money. He or she can use a calculator to check his or her work. A person with dysgraphia can benefit from using a computer, using a tape recorder, drawing a picture, or using checklists to organize and express thoughts. A person who has dyspraxia can benefit from physical or occupational therapy to improve his or her coordination and ability to perform daily tasks.\n\nIf your child has a learning disability, work closely with his or her teachers and your doctor and other health care professionals to make sure your child gets the needed help. With appropriate intervention and educational programs, most people find ways to compensate for their learning disability and can lead successful, productive lives.\n\nSupport groups and other organizations are available for people with learning disabilities and their friends and family members.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Common Ear Problems in Children]\nEar infections are a common problem in young children, especially between ages 6 months and 1 year. Middle ear infections occur when an upper respiratory infection, such as a cold, spreads to the middle ear cavity by way of the eustachian tube.\n\nSome children have repeated ear infections, which, if left untreated, can lead to serious complications, such as hearing loss. Hearing loss that occurs early in childhood can have a significant impact on a child's speech and language development.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Common Ear Problems in Children > Ear Infections]\nInfection or inflammation of the middle ear (a condition that doctors call otitis media) can occur in people of all ages but is most common in infants and young children. Otitis media can be either acute (short and severe) or chronic (long-lasting). If a child has three or more acute ear infections within 6 months, or four or more infections within 12 months, the condition is called recurrent acute otitis media.\n\nOtitis media can result when fluid or mucus from a bacterial or viral infection of the nose and throat (such as a cold or flu) or an allergy causes the eustachian tube (the tube that connects the middle ear to the back of the nose and throat) to swell and to drain improperly. Exposure to secondhand smoke can increase the risk of inflammation and infection of the respiratory tract and problems with the eustachian tube in young children. In some children, the adenoids (lymph tissue that lies on each side of the back wall of the nose and the upper part of the throat) can become enlarged and can block drainage from the eustachian tube. If the eustachian tube is blocked, pus can build up in the middle ear, putting pressure on the eardrum and causing severe pain, hearing loss, and, possibly, a ruptured eardrum (see page 1022).\n\nEar infections and accumulation of middle ear fluid are more frequent in children than in adults because a child's eustachian tubes are smaller and more horizontal than\n\nthose of an adult, making it more difficult for infected fluid to drain.

Chronic otitis media with effusion can also develop without infection —from an anatomical cause such as a cleft palate (see page 403), Down syndrome (see page 955), or a too-narrow eustachian tube. In some cases, the fluid becomes very sticky (which doctors call glue ear). The buildup of fluid can cause mild hearing loss and may delay a child's language development.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nChronic middle ear fluid often does not cause any symptoms. However, sounds may seem muffled or faint, as if heard under water. Some children may have difficulty distinguishing certain sounds in noisy situations.\n\nIf untreated, chronic middle ear fluid can result in poor development of language skills in very young children. Less often, the disorder can cause an abnormal growth of the skin of the eardrum (cholesteatoma; see page 1024). Chronic middle ear fluid can also cause the tiny bones of the middle ear (ossicles) to become scarred and bond to the middle ear. If your child is developing language skills slowly or does not respond when you speak to him or her, or if he or she is having trouble paying attention at school, it could be due to partial hearing loss from chronic middle ear fluid.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nBecause chronic middle ear fluid usually has no obvious symptoms, doctors often diagnose the disorder while examining a child for another reason or during a well-child visit. However, if you suspect that your child has hearing loss after he or she has had an ear infection, see your doctor. The doctor will take a detailed health history and examine the affected ear with a lighted viewing instrument called an otoscope. He or she may also use a device called a pneumatic otoscope, which blows a puff of air into the ear to check for stiffness of the eardrum.\n\nThe doctor may refer you to an otolaryngologist (a doctor who specializes in disorders of the ear, nose, and throat), who may perform special tests such as an impedance test (see page 1016), which can help determine whether your child has fluid in his or her ear. The doctor may refer you to an audiologist (a health care professional who specializes in hearing evaluation and treatment), who will perform hearing tests (see page 1016) to determine if your child has any hearing loss.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > *Treatment*]\nTo treat chronic middle ear fluid that has resulted from a bacterial infection, a doctor may prescribe antibiotics, especially if he or she suspects an underlying sinus infection. Most doctors prefer to wait to see if the fluid clears up on its own, which can take up to 3 months when it affects both ears, and up to 6 months when it affects only one ear. In some cases, a doctor may recommend a procedure called myringotomy (see previous page), to drain the fluid.\n\nHowever, myringotomy is usually done only if the child has significant hearing loss that could interfere with his or her language development.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Respiratory System]\nThe respiratory system delivers oxygen to the body's cells and removes carbon dioxide from the body. The respiratory system consists of the nose, throat, larynx (voice box), trachea (windpipe), and lungs, and a system of blood vessels that carry blood to and from the lungs. In children, infections are the most common cause of respiratory system disorders.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Adenoid Disorders]\nThe adenoids are small masses of lymph (infection-fighting) tissue that lie on either side of the back of the nasal cavity, above the tonsils, and are part of the body's immune system. In most children, the adenoids begin to grow at about age 3, when children are especially vulnerable to infection. At about age 5, the adenoids begin to shrink, and usually disappear by the time a child reaches puberty. In some children, however, the adenoids continue to grow, eventually blocking the airway that leads from the nose to the throat. When this occurs, the flow of secretions at the back of the nose is blocked, and the adenoids become infected. If the infection is not treated promptly, it can spread from the nasal cavity through the eustachian tube to the middle ear, causing a middle ear infection (see page 417).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Adenoid Disorders > *Symptoms*]\nWhen the airway that leads from the nose to the throat is blocked, the child usually has a stuffy nose, breathes through the mouth, and snores. In some cases, the child's voice may sound nasal. Infected secretions drip from the child's nose during the day. When the child lies down, these secretions drip down into the throat, causing an irritating cough.

The infection usually occurs in children under 2 and usually develops during the fall, winter, or early spring. Premature infants have an increased risk of severe bronchiolitis. If your baby has an increased risk of bronchiolitis, the doctor may recommend preventive treatment with monoclonal antibodies (infection-fighting proteins produced in a laboratory to target specific infectious agents) to protect against infection with RSV. Like the common cold, bronchiolitis easily spreads among young children through contact with saliva, mucus, or airborne droplets.

The child may need to sit up to breathe and may also wheeze. He or she may vomit and be unable to keep liquids down. If your child's skin ever looks bluish, take him or her to the nearest hospital emergency department immediately.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > ***Diagnosis***]\nTo diagnose bronchiolitis, the doctor will ask you about your child's symptoms and examine him or her for signs of dehydration, such as a dry mouth, sunken eyes, and a sunken soft spot. He or she will use a stethoscope to listen to the child's lungs for characteristic wheezing or bubbling noises that indicate the presence of mucus in the bronchioles.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > ***Treatment***]\nIn mild cases of bronchiolitis, treatment may not be necessary. Your doctor probably will recommend giving your child plenty of liquids and using a cool-mist vaporizer in the child's bedroom while he or she is sleeping to help relieve congestion. Give your\n\nchild acetaminophen or ibuprofen (not aspirin) if he or she has a fever. In some cases, a doctor may prescribe liquid medication or nebulizer treatments with a bronchodilator drug to control the coughing and wheezing. A nebulizer is a device that mixes medication with water vapor to produce a mist that the person inhales. To help prevent the infection from spreading, wash your hands frequently, especially after caring for your child.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Recurring Colds or Coldlike Symptoms]\nIt is normal for a child to have a number of coughs and colds, especially during the winter, and usually it is not a cause for concern. Children who are in day care with several children frequently get colds, as do children in their first few years of school, because they are exposed to many new viruses. Gradually, however, they acquire immunity to increasing numbers of cold viruses.\n\nA child's cold is often accompanied by a cough because, instead of blowing his or her nose, a child usually sniffs mucus down into the throat. The mucus irritates the throat, and the child coughs in an attempt to eliminate the mucus. Abdominal pain resulting from swallowing mucus is another common symptom in a child with a cold. In some cases, a child with a cold may complain of abdominal pain, which is actually muscle strain caused by coughing.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Recurring Colds or Coldlike Symptoms > *When to See a Doctor*]\nYour child may not have a cold, even if he or she has cold symptoms. In some children, coldlike symptoms result from an allergic reaction (see page 912). If your child sneezes and has a runny nose and watery eyes during the warm months, he or she probably has an allergy to pollen. However, if the symptoms occur throughout the year, your child may be allergic to some other allergen, such as mold or dust mites. In some children, recurring coughs result from a serious underlying disorder. For example, a recurring cough that is accompanied by wheezing may be a symptom of asthma (see page 640), sinusitis (see page 651), or enlarged adenoids (see page 419). In rare cases, a recurring cough may be caused by the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis (see page 958).

The spots usually appear on the ankles, shins, buttocks, and elbows. The spots tend to come and go and fade after several weeks. In some people, the rash is preceded by a sore throat, headache, fever, and loss of appetite.\n\nSome children also may have swollen joints (usually the ankles or the knees), abdominal pain that is often severe and persistent, and blood in the stool. About half have blood in their urine and a low volume of urine, which, in severe cases, can indicate widespread obstruction of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in the filtering structures (glomeruli) of the kidneys (glomerulonephritis; see page 807). Some children may develop high blood pressure.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nAllergic purpura is diagnosed by the symptoms, a physical examination, a thorough health history, and blood and urine tests. X-rays or CT scans may be performed to evaluate any complications that develop in the intestines or other organs. In most cases, treatment is not necessary because the condition tends to clear up on its own within a month, but a child may be hospitalized to watch for serious complications. For severe cases, a doctor may prescribe corticosteroids to reduce inflammation, or intravenous gamma globulin (which contains antibodies to fight infection) to alleviate symptoms.\n\nIf the kidneys are affected, the doctor will want to see the child for regular checkups to monitor the health of the kidneys. In some cases, a doctor may do a kidney biopsy (microscopic examination of a sample of tissue from the kidney). Elevated levels of blood or protein in the urine may persist for months in some children; these symptoms also require follow-up checkups. If the child develops high blood pressure, the doctor will prescribe medication to control it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Iron Deficiency Anemia in Children]\nIron deficiency anemia, the most common form of anemia in children, results from an insufficient supply of hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein) in the blood. The disorder usually results from an insufficient intake of iron in the diet or from poor absorption of iron by the body. Most full-term babies are born with an adequate supply of iron from their mother during pregnancy and receive iron from breast milk or formula. However, as the child grows and has an increased need for iron, a diet deficient in iron can lead to anemia. Preterm infants, who often are born with an inadequate supply of iron, and children who have a disorder that inhibits iron absorption, such as celiac disease (see page 768), have an increased risk of developing anemia. Infants should not drink cow's milk because it interferes with the absorption of iron and irritates the intestinal lining, causing intestinal bleeding and further contributing to anemia.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Iron Deficiency Anemia in Children > *Symptoms*]\nMild anemia usually causes no obvious symptoms. In more severe cases, symptoms can include pale skin (especially on the hands and inside the lower eyelids), fatigue, weakness, or behavioral changes such as irritability or anger. Less often, fainting, breathlessness, and heart palpitations may occur. All of these symptoms are more obvious after physical activity. If your child is less active than usual or if he or she is breathless after even moderate activity, see your doctor. If you suspect that your child may have anemia, do not try to treat it yourself with iron supplements, because too much iron can be dangerous.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Iron Deficiency Anemia in Children > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose iron deficiency anemia, a doctor will take blood samples to measure the level of iron. To rule out other causes, such as internal bleeding or a problem in the digestive tract that blocks iron absorption, a doctor may recommend tests such as a stool analysis to check for blood (which could indicate internal bleeding), or X-rays of the digestive tract.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > **Iron Supplements**]\nAccidental overdose of iron through supplements is the leading cause of poisoning death in children under age 6. If your doctor has prescribed iron supplements for your child, administer them exactly as directed. To prevent an overdose or poisoning, always keep all supplements out of the reach of children.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > *Treatment*]\nTo treat mild iron deficiency anemia, the doctor will make dietary recommendations to help the child get sufficient iron from his or her diet, such as ensuring that the child has an adequate intake of vitamin C, which facilitates iron absorption. To treat severe iron deficiency anemia caused by lack of iron in the diet, the doctor may prescribe iron supplements (usually in liquid form) for your child to take for 2 months or longer.

The reproductive organs are closely linked to the urinary tract.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Urinary Tract and Reproductive Organs > The urinary tract]\nThe urinary tract consists of the kidneys, the ureters, the bladder, and the urethra. The kidneys remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood to make urine. The ureters are two tubes that transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder, where the urine is stored until it is expelled from the body. The urethra is a tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the human urinary tract. It shows two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder, and a urethra.]()![](_page_763_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Urinary Tract and Reproductive Organs > Urinary Tract Infections]\nIn a urinary tract infection, microorganisms (usually bacteria) invade the urinary tract and multiply. Urinary tract infections are common among children. Girls are especially susceptible because the female urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder) is\n\nfairly short, making it relatively easy for bacteria to move up the urethra and into the bladder.\n\nFew risks are associated with one or two urinary tract infections. However, if the child is a boy or is younger than 2, or if the infection recurs, the child may have an underlying abnormality of the urinary tract that requires treatment to help prevent more serious urinary problems, such as chronic pyelonephritis (see page 806), chronic kidney failure (see page 817), or vesicoureteral reflux (see next page).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nSometimes a urinary tract infection does not cause symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include a persistent urge to urinate, difficulty urinating, or a burning sensation while urinating. The child may experience pain in the lower back, in the abdomen, or in the groin area. He or she may also have a fever, and his or her urine may be discolored and have a strong, unpleasant odor. If your child has symptoms of a urinary tract infection, talk to your doctor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA diagnosis of a urinary tract infection is based on a child's symptoms, a physical examination, and the results of urine tests. If your child is a boy or is younger than 2, has recurring urinary tract infections, or appears to be very ill, the doctor will recommend additional tests, such as an ultrasound (see page 111) or a CT scan (see page 112) of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder; a radionuclide scan (see page 114) of the kidneys; and a voiding cystogram (see page 805). The ultrasound or CT scan shows the shape of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. The radionuclide scan shows how the kidneys function and detects any infection in the kidneys. The voiding cystogram enables the doctor to examine the bladder during urination to determine the size of the bladder and to check for vesicoureteral reflux.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTo treat a urinary tract infection, a doctor will prescribe antibiotics in tablets or in liquid form. If the kidneys are affected, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics given intravenously (through a vein).\n\nAny underlying abnormality of the urinary tract can be corrected with surgery. The doctor will recommend giving your child plenty of clear fluids, preferably water, and encouraging your child to empty his or her bladder completely and frequently (at least every 4 to 6 hours). The symptoms usually subside a few days after the child begins taking the antibiotics, but your child still needs to finish all of the prescribed medication or the infection will recur.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Vesicoureteral Reflux]\nVesicoureteral reflux is a urinary tract disorder in which the mechanism that prevents the backflow of urine malfunctions, causing urine to flow backward from the bladder through the ureters and up into the kidneys. This backflow of urine can cause increased pressure on the kidneys or recurring kidney infections, both of which can lead to permanent damage and scarring of the kidneys.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Bed-Wetting]\nBy age 4 or 5, most children stay dry through the night. Other children may continue to wet the bed at night, and, in rare cases, may also wet themselves during the day. The medical term for this condition is enuresis. If a child begins wetting the bed again after a long period of staying dry through the night, the condition is called secondary enuresis.

A doctor will order blood tests to evaluate kidney function and may order an X-ray of the urinary tract called a voiding cystourethrogram (see page 805) to check for vesicoureteral reflux and, if the condition is present, determine its severity. The doctor may also recommend an ultrasound (see page 111) of the kidneys to check their size and shape and to look for a cyst, a stone, an obstruction, or another abnormality.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe treatment for vesicoureteral reflux depends on the severity of the disorder. Mild cases usually clear up on their own within about 5 years. Doctors often prescribe preventive treatment with antibiotics for children who develop frequent urinary tract infections. In some cases, medication is prescribed to control high blood pressure. In other cases, surgery is performed on the ureters to create a flap of tissue that works like a valve and prevents the backflow of urine. In severe cases the damaged kidney may be removed surgically. The remaining kidney will do the work of both kidneys.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis**]\nPoststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (also called nephritis) is a rare condition that develops in a child after an infection with streptococcal bacteria. In response to the\n\ninfection, the body's immune system produces antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) to fight the bacteria, but because of a malfunction in the immune system, the antibodies continue to be active even after the bacteria have been destroyed, and attack the kidneys. The kidneys become inflamed and produce less urine than normal. Blood leaks from the glomeruli (the filtering units of the kidney) into the urine. With prompt treatment, most children recover completely from poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. However, a few children experience persistent kidney problems and, after many years, may develop chronic kidney failure (see page 817).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nThe main symptom of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is reduced output of urine. The urine looks smoky or reddish brown because it contains blood. The reduced output of urine leads to edema, an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the body that causes swelling around the eyes and face and sometimes over the entire body. In addition to edema, some children with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis may gain weight, lose their appetite, have abdominal pain or diarrhea, or develop high blood pressure (see page 574).\n\nA diagnosis of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is based on a child's symptoms and the results of a physical examination. If the doctor suspects poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, he or she will order blood and urine tests to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf your child is very ill, the doctor may recommend bed rest. The doctor will put your child on a special diet that restricts his or her intake of sodium, potassium, liquids, and, possibly, foods that are high in protein (such as meat, fish, and eggs). The diet is designed to reduce strain on the kidneys and prevent the accumulation of fluid.\n\nThe doctor may prescribe antibiotics to treat any remaining strep infection and a diuretic to increase the child's output of urine, eliminate excess fluid from the body, and control blood pressure.\n\nIf the child's condition worsens, he or she will be hospitalized to treat any complications that could develop, such as kidney failure, heart failure (see page 570), or severe high blood pressure. The doctor will monitor your child's blood pressure and will prescribe antihypertensive medications if the child develops high blood pressure.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome]\nHemolytic uremic syndrome is a rare complication of a severe gastrointestinal infection, usually with a specific type of *E. coli* bacteria (*E. coli* O157:H7). The bacteria can be acquired by eating contaminated food such as meat, poultry, or potatoes; drinking contaminated juice, water, or dairy products; or touching infected people or contaminated surfaces. Hemolytic uremic syndrome occurs when toxins from the bacteria get into the bloodstream and damage red blood cells (which carry oxygen to tissues) and platelets (which help blood to clot). The damaged red blood cells and platelets can then clog the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys, blocking the ability of the kidneys to filter and remove waste products.\n\nHemolytic uremic syndrome is one of the leading causes of acute kidney failure in children under 10. Although most children have no long-term complications from hemolytic uremic syndrome, some may have permanent kidney damage and may need dialysis (see page 818) or a kidney transplant (see page 820). In severe cases, hemolytic uremic syndrome can be fatal.\n\nProper food handling and pr", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "kidney", "relation": "function", "tail": "evaluate"}, {"head": "X-ray", "relation": "check", "tail": "vesicoureteral reflux"}, {"head": "ultrasound", "relation": "check", "tail": "size and shape"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "order", "tail": "[Event: blood tests]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "order", "tail": "[Event: X-ray of the urinary tract]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "recommend", "tail": "[Event: ultrasound of the kidneys]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Usually only one kidney is affected, although both can be affected. The abnormal kidney may be either small or enlarged, with a number of irregular cysts. Renal dysplasia is one of the most common prenatal developmental abnormalities and is often detected before birth during a routine ultrasound scan. The disorder is not inherited.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe most common sign of renal dysplasia in a newborn is a noticeable mass in the baby's abdomen. The infant may also develop a urinary tract infection, blood in the urine, and high blood pressure. If both kidneys are affected, infants sometimes die if they do not receive a kidney transplant (see page 820). Other developmental\n\nabnormalities of the urinary tract—such as an obstructed bladder, ureter, or urethra—are also sometimes present.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nDoctors often identify renal dysplasia during an ultrasound scan before birth. In older children, doctors sometimes detect the possibility of renal dysplasia during a physical examination while taking the child's blood pressure. The diagnosis can be confirmed by an ultrasound scan or a radionuclide scan (see page 114).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nA child with renal dysplasia may not require treatment because a person can live with only one working kidney. However, if the disorder causes health problems, the doctor may recommend surgical removal of the affected kidney. If both kidneys are affected, the doctor will probably recommend a kidney transplant.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Wilms' Tumor**]\nWilms' tumor is a rare, life-threatening cancer in which a malignant growth forms in one of the kidneys. The disorder usually affects children under age 5, boys twice as often as girls. The disorder tends to run in families. Prompt treatment is needed to prevent the cancerous cells from spreading to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver, brain, or the other kidney.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptom of Wilms' tumor is a hard lump that can be felt in the child's abdomen. Other symptoms may include a slight fever, loss of appetite, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. A child with Wilms' tumor may also have the blood disorder anemia (see page 610), which can cause weakness and fatigue, and he or she may develop high blood pressure (see page 574). If your child has any of these symptoms, see your doctor right away.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nTo diagnose Wilms' tumor, the doctor will ask about your child's symptoms and perform a physical examination. The doctor will order a CT scan (see page 112) or MRI (see page 113) to locate and evaluate the tumor and to determine if the cancer has spread. He or she may order a biopsy (a microscopic examination of tissue from the tumor) to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIf Wilms' tumor is diagnosed, surgery will be performed to remove the affected kidney and prevent the cancer from spreading. The remaining kidney is able to take over the work of the one that is removed. The doctor will prescribe anticancer medication and, in some cases, radiation therapy to destroy any remaining cancer cells.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment* > **Undescended Testicles**]\nIn boys, the testicles develop inside the abdomen from the same embryonic tissue that becomes the ovaries in girls. In most boys, both testicles descend through the abdominal wall and into the scrotum (the pouch of skin that surrounds the testicles) about a month before birth. In a small number of boys, for reasons that are not known, one testicle or, less frequently, both testicles do not descend into the scrotum by birth. In these cases, the testicle or testicles usually descend by 1 year of age. If the testicles do not descend by age 1, surgery is necessary to bring them down into the scrotum. If the condition is not corrected, the child has an increased risk of being infertile and of developing testicular cancer (see page 824) in either testicle after puberty. For these reasons, early treatment is essential.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nUndescended testicles do not cause pain or interfere with urination. Some boys who have an undescended testicle may also have an inguinal hernia (see page 763). If either or both of your son's testicles have not descended by age 1, see the child's doctor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > **Undescended testicles**]\nIn some boys, a testicle may fail to descend from the abdomen into the scrotum before birth.

However, some disorders that affect the muscles, bones, or joints in children —such as rheumatic fever, osteomyelitis, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis— can be life-threatening and often result in permanent impairment.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Rheumatic Fever]\nRheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that can develop after an infection with streptococcal bacteria, such as strep throat (see page 652). Rheumatic fever can affect the heart, brain, joints, and skin. The disease can occur at any age but usually affects children between ages 5 and 15.\n\nIf untreated, rheumatic fever can damage the heart, in a condition called rheumatic heart disease. The inflammation that characterizes rheumatic heart disease can cause heart muscle damage (myocarditis), an irregular heart rate (arrhythmia), or heart valve injury. Damage to the heart valves can prevent the valves from completely opening or closing, which forces the heart to work harder to pump blood. If the heart valves are damaged permanently, health problems such as congestive heart failure (see page 570) can develop.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Rheumatic Fever > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of rheumatic fever can resemble those of other illnesses and usually develop 1 to 6 weeks after a strep throat infection. (In some people, a strep infection can be so mild that it is not noticed.) Symptoms of rheumatic fever include fever; joint pain and swelling that moves from joint to joint (called migratory arthritis); a ring-shaped rash on the chest, back, or abdomen; or abnormal writhing movements of the body and limbs. The child may develop chest pain, changes in heart rate, and symptoms of congestive heart failure (such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and swelling of the legs, ankles, and feet). To prevent rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, see the doctor if you or your child has symptoms of strep throat, such as swollen tonsils, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, and fever. Strep spreads easily among family members.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose rheumatic fever, a doctor will take a detailed health history, listen to the child's heart and lungs with a stethoscope, and examine the skin for a rash and the joints for pain and swelling. The doctor may take a sample from the child's throat to check for strep throat and order blood tests to look for evidence of a streptococcal infection. He or she may order an electrocardiogram (see page 559), which records the electrical activity of the heart, and an ultrasound examination of the heart (echocardiogram; see page 561) to check for heart damage.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIn most cases, treating a strep throat promptly with antibiotics will prevent rheumatic fever. To treat rheumatic fever, a doctor may recommend drugs such as corticosteroids to reduce the inflammation, and he or she will prescribe antibiotics if streptococcal bacteria are present. He or she may also prescribe long-term treatment with antibiotics to prevent recurring strep infections, which can reactivate rheumatic fever.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Scoliosis**]\nScoliosis is an abnormal curvature of the spine that develops or becomes apparent during the growth spurt of puberty, between ages 10 and 12. The condition affects girls more often than boys. In most cases, the cause is unknown, but some forms can be present at birth, inherited, or related to muscle and neurologic disorders.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nIn many children, the curvature of the spine is so slight that it is not noticeable. In some cases, the curvature causes the shoulders, hips, or waist to be uneven. The legs may appear unequal in length and the shoulder blades may be more prominent than usual. In severe cases, the curvature can affect the heart and lungs.\n\nDoctors screen for scoliosis as part of a routine physical examination. If your child has scoliosis, the doctor will refer you to a bone specialist (orthopedist), who will examine your child and order X-rays to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTreatment of scoliosis depends on the degree of the curvature. For a curvature of less than 20 degrees, no treatment is necessary, but a child's spine should be examined at regular intervals. A curvature between 20 and 40 degrees is usually treated with a lightweight brace (worn under clothing) to prevent the curvature from worsening. The child may also need physical therapy to help strengthen his or her back muscles. If the brace is not effective or the curvature is more than 40 degrees, the doctor may recommend surgery to correct it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Osteomyelitis**]\nOsteomyelitis is a rare bacterial infection of the bone that can develop when bacteria from a contaminated wou", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "injuries", "relation": "cause", "tail": "muscle, bone, or joint problems"}, {"head": "rheumatic fever", "relation": "affect", "tail": "heart, brain, joints, and skin"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "streptococcal bacteria", "relation": "cause", "tail": "[Event: rheumatic fever]"}, {"head": "infection", "relation": "lead to", "tail": "[Event: rheumatic fever]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: rheumatic fever]"}]}, "status": "success"}

He or she also may order blood tests, X-rays of the affected areas, and a biopsy of the membrane that encloses one of the affected joints. In a biopsy, a small amount of tissue is removed from the membrane for examination under a microscope. The doctor also may recommend laboratory analysis of the fluid inside the joints (synovial fluid).\n\nThe doctor may refer your child to a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in treating joint disorders) for further evaluation and treatment. He or she will recommend that your child see an ophthalmologist (a doctor who specializes in treating eye disorders), who can evaluate your child's eyes for signs of inflammation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTreatment for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis focuses on reducing the inflammation. The doctor may recommend giving your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce the fever and relieve pain, or he or she may prescribe a stronger anti-inflammatory medication to reduce pain and inflammation. The doctor will recommend a combination of physical therapy and regular exercise to slow progression of the disease, help restore and maintain mobility and flexibility in the joints, and build strength and endurance. Because fatigue can trigger a flare-up, help your child learn to balance exercise and other activities with periods of rest. Regular eye examinations are needed to check for signs of vision loss.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Childhood Infections]\nInfectious diseases occur when infectious microorganisms enter the body through the thin membranes that line the respiratory system or digestive tract. After the microbes enter the body, they start multiplying and can spread through the bloodstream and lymphatic system, causing symptoms.\n\nThe immune system attempts to fight the infection by producing proteins called antibodies to neutralize or destroy the microbes. Each microbe triggers production of a specific antibody that recognizes it. Once you have\n\nhad a particular childhood infection, your immune system is able to recognize the infection-causing germ the next time and destroy it before symptoms develop.\n\nInfectious diseases are contagious, which means that they can be spread from one person to another. Childhood infectious diseases can be contracted by inhaling airborne droplets that have been sneezed or coughed into the air by an infected person, or by direct contact with infected secretions. After recovering from some childhood infections—such as measles, rubella, chickenpox, or mumps—a child becomes immune to them, which means that he or she cannot be reinfected. This process is called natural immunity. Today, these infectious diseases are prevented with immunization, injections of harmless forms of the infectious agents to produce immunity.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Childhood Infections > Caring for a Child Who Is Ill]\nWhen a child is ill, he or she may be fussy and irritable or seem withdrawn and mokey. A sick child needs to be comforted. If your child is sick, pay special attention to his or her needs. Keep a record of his or her symptoms and, if you are unsure about anything, call your child's doctor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Childhood Infections > *Giving Medications to Children*]\nIf your child has difficulty taking medication, ask the doctor for tips. A child 3 years old or older may be able to swallow a tablet or capsule whole with the help of a drink. If the child can't swallow a tablet, ask your doctor if you should crush it and mix it with a food the child likes, such as apple-sauce or pudding. Don't open a capsule and mix its contents with food, because you could alter the timed-release properties of the medication. Remember that some medications should only be taken on an empty stomach. If you have any questions, ask the doctor.\n\nBecause small children often cannot swallow pills easily, doctors usually prescribe medication for them in liquid form. Give the medication exactly as prescribed, shaking the bottle if it is required. Special medication spoons are available that measure doses accurately. Measuring spoons for cooking, dosing cups, and oral syringes are also accurate, but make sure the unit of measurement is the same as the unit of the dose you\n\nwant to give. Never use silverware spoons to give medicine to a child because the sizes of spoons can vary.\n\nIt is important for a child who is ill to take all the medication exactly as prescribed. If you are giving medicine to a sick child, keep the following in mind:\n\n- **Immediately remove and dispose of the cap on a medicine syringe.** Children can choke on these caps.\n- **Never share prescription medications.** Although two children may have the same illness, they may have different medication needs.\n- **Never give a child leftover medication.** If a child w", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "order", "tail": "blood tests"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "perform", "tail": "physical examination"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "recommend", "tail": "laboratory analysis of the fluid inside the joints"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "child", "relation": "participate in", "tail": "[Event: physical examination]"}, {"head": "child", "relation": "participate in", "tail": "[Event: blood tests]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "recommend", "tail": "[Event: laboratory analysis of the fluid inside the joints]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: physical examination]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: diagnosis]"}, {"head": "[Event: blood tests]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: diagnosis]"}, {"head": "[Event: laboratory analysis of the fluid inside the joints]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: diagnosis]"}]}, "status": "success"}

The disease is contracted by inhaling airborne droplets that have been coughed or sneezed into the air by an infected person. Possible complications of measles include croup (see page 420), bronchiolitis (see page 421), bronchitis (see page 655), pneumonia (see page 660), and encephalitis (see page 694).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nThe initial symptoms of measles include irritability; fever; a runny nose; red, watery eyes; a dry, hacking cough; swollen glands; and, sometimes, diarrhea. In some cases, tiny white spots (called Koplik's spots) that resemble grains of salt appear inside the mouth. Within about 4 to 5 days, a rash of flat, pink spots (each about  $\\frac{1}{10}$  inch in diameter) begins to develop, first on the forehead and behind the ears, and then on the face, neck, trunk, arms, legs, and feet. A few days after it appears, the rash begins to fade and the fever breaks.\n\nSome children with measles may be sensitive to bright light. Although this symptom is usually no cause for concern, tell your doctor because, in rare cases, it can be a sign of meningitis (see page 692), which can be life-threatening.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosis and Treatment]\nA diagnosis of measles is based on the child's symptoms and the results of a physical examination. The doctor will recommend having your child rest and giving him or her plenty of fluids, such as water, lemonade, fruit juice, or clear broth. He or she will recommend acetaminophen or ibuprofen (not aspirin) to help relieve the pain or reduce the fever. If your child is sensitive to bright light, dim the light in his or her room, or have him or her wear sunglasses. If your child develops a secondary bacterial infection such as a sore throat, an ear infection, or pneumonia, the doctor will prescribe antibiotics. Most children recover from measles within 10 to 14 days.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prevention*]\nTo prevent measles, have your child vaccinated (see page 376) when he or she is 12 to 15 months old, and again between ages 4 and 6. A doctor may give an unvaccinated child who has been exposed to measles an injection of antibodies called immunoglobulin to fight the infection, or a measles vaccination within 72 hours of exposure to the virus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Rubella**]\nRubella (also called German measles) is a mild viral infection that affects the skin and the lymph glands. The disease is usually contracted by inhaling airborne droplets coughed or sneezed into the air by an infected person. Rubella is slightly less common than measles (see previous page) and is not as contagious.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe initial symptoms of rubella include a slight fever and swollen glands behind the ears, down the side of the neck, and on the back of the neck. After 1 or 2 days, a rash of flat, reddish pink spots (each about  $1/10$  inch in diameter) appears on the head or elsewhere on the body. Gradually, the spots may merge to form patches. The rash does not itch, and it lasts for about 3 days. Other possible symptoms include a runny or stuffy nose, red eyes, pain and swelling in the joints, and, in boys, pain and swelling in the testicles.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of rubella is based on the symptoms and the results of a physical examination. The doctor may recommend rest, plenty of fluids, and acetaminophen or ibuprofen (not aspirin) to reduce fever and relieve pain. Most children recover completely from rubella in about 1 week.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prevention*]\nA combined vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella is available, and all children should be vaccinated (see page 376). Women who could become pregnant and who have not been vaccinated for rubella (see page 508) should be vaccinated to prevent a group of birth defects called congenital rubella syndrome, which includes cataracts, congenital heart disease, and low birth weight. Because the vaccination can cause birth defects, a woman should not get pregnant for at least 3 months after having the vaccination.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Roseola Infantum**]\nRoseola infantum is a mild viral infection caused by one of two types of herpesvirus (type 6 or type 7). The infection is spread through contact with infected respiratory secretions or saliva. Roseola usually affects children between ages 6 months and 3 years.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe initial symptoms of roseola are usually irritability and a sudden high fever (between 101 °F and 105°F). In some children, the fever may cause seizures (see page 410). After about 2 to 5 days, the child's temperature suddenly returns to normal (98.6°F). As the fever subsides, a raised rash of pink or red spots appears on the child's trunk and may quickly spread to his or her neck, face, arms, and legs. The rash usually lasts for no more than 3 to 5 days.

Applying calamine lotion to the rash will help relieve itching. Oatmeal soaps or bath preparations and warm compresses can be helpful. Bathwater should be cool or lukewarm. If the rash occurs in the genital area, an anesthetic cream can be applied to relieve pain; ask the doctor to recommend one. If the rash becomes infected from excessive scratching, your doctor may prescribe a topical antibiotic ointment or an oral antibiotic. In some cases, doctors prescribe an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine to relieve itching. Trimming your child's nails if necessary can help prevent scratches.\n\nDoctors sometimes recommend an injection of chickenpox antibodies called zoster immunoglobulin to prevent or reduce the severity of the disease in children who have an increased risk of complications, such as those with immune system disorders or who are undergoing chemotherapy for cancer. An antiviral drug called acyclovir, taken by mouth, is sometimes prescribed to reduce the severity of the infection or shorten it.\n\nGive your child cold fluids and soft, bland foods. Avoid salty or acidic foods and drinks. The doctor may recommend giving your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce fever and relieve pain. (Do not give aspirin to a child or adolescent who has a fever because aspirin has been linked to a potentially fatal disorder called Reye's syndrome; see page 411.) Most children with chickenpox recover within about 7 to 10 days.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Mumps]\nMumps is a viral infection that causes inflammation and swelling of the saliva-producing (salivary) glands between the ear and the jaw. In some cases a child's joints, pancreas, testicles, or ovaries also may be affected. Mumps occurs most often in the spring and usually is spread through contact with infected saliva. The disease usually occurs in children ages 10 or older; having the infection provides lifelong immunity. Possible complications of mumps include encephalitis (see page 694), meningitis (see page 692), acute pancreatitis (see page 798), and orchitis (swelling of the testicle) in older boys. Doctors recommend that all children be vaccinated (see page 376) against mumps between 12 months and 15 months of age, and again between ages 4 and 6.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptoms of mumps are swelling and tenderness on the sides of the face under the ears, which may be accompanied by an earache. In most cases, both sides of the face become swollen, one side of the face a few days before the other. A child can have difficulty talking, chewing, and swallowing. In most cases, he or she also has a headache, a fever (up to 103°F), loss of appetite, and diarrhea. If a child's testicle becomes swollen, symptoms include pain in the affected testicle, chills, a high fever (up to 106°F), nausea, and vomiting. Swelling of the ovaries or pancreas can cause discomfort or pain in the lower abdomen.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of mumps is based on a child's symptoms and the results of a physical examination. Have your child rest, and give him or her plenty of fluids, including water, fruit juice, sports drinks, tea, or decaffeinated soft drinks. Your doctor will recommend giving your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen (not aspirin) to relieve the pain and fever. You can also help relieve pain in the affected area by applying an ice pack wrapped in a towel. If the testicles are swollen, the doctor will prescribe medication to relieve the pain and swelling. Applying warm or cool packs to the testicles can often be helpful. A child with mumps usually recovers completely within about 10 to 12 days.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment* > Whooping Cough]\nWhooping cough (also called pertussis) is a serious bacterial infection of the respiratory system caused by the bacterium *Bordetella pertussis*, which makes the air passages become inflamed, narrowed, and clogged with thick mucus. The infection is spread by inhaling droplets that have been sneezed or coughed into the air by an infected person. The severe coughing bouts that are characteristic of the infection, which can cause permanent damage to an infant's lungs or brain, are the body's attempts to clear the lungs of mucus. Young infants (6 months old or younger) can contract the disease from adolescents or adults who have not been vaccinated or whose vaccine protection has weakened over time.\n\nAll children are required to be vaccinated against whooping cough (in a combined vaccine with diphtheria and tetanus) starting at 2 months of age, and four more times up to age 6. A child who has been immunized against whooping cough may still develop a\n\nmild case of the infection.

A day or two after the fever begins, small red blisters appear inside the mouth—usually on the tongue and gums, inside the cheeks, and down the throat. The blisters break open and form open sores. Chewing and swallowing may become painful, and the child may lose his or her appetite. He or she may also avoid drinking, which can cause dehydration. A painful, red, blistery rash that is not itchy appears on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. The rash also may occur between the fingers and toes and on the thighs or buttocks or in the groin area.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nTo diagnose hand-foot-and-mouth disease, the doctor will ask about your child's symptoms and perform a physical examination. In some cases, a doctor may take a throat swab or a stool sample for laboratory analysis to detect the virus and confirm the diagnosis.\n\nTo treat hand-foot-and-mouth disease, give your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen (not aspirin) to relieve the pain and reduce the fever, and plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. If he or she has trouble swallowing, try giving him or her ice chips to suck. Cold foods such as frozen yogurt or ice cream can help numb the inside of the mouth and relieve pain. Most children recover from the infection within about 10 days.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prevention*]\nTo prevent hand-foot-and-mouth disease, wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, especially after using the bathroom or changing diapers. Teach your child to wash his or her hands carefully after using the bathroom. If your child has hand-foot-and-mouth disease, do not let him or her share cups, glasses, or eating utensils. Disinfect potentially contaminated surfaces in your home with a household cleaner. Wash your child's soiled clothing in detergent and hot water. Keep your child home from school or day care and away from other people until the fever is gone and the sores have healed.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Polio]\nPolio (poliomyelitis) is a viral infection that affects the brain and spinal cord. The infection can be spread through contact with an infected person or by ingesting food or water that is contaminated with the virus. Thanks to routine vaccination (see page 374), polio is now rare in the United States. Children are vaccinated against polio when they are 2 months, 4 months, 6 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years of age.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nIn most cases, a polio infection is mild, does not affect the nervous system, and does not produce symptoms. In some cases, symptoms—such as a slight fever, sore throat, upset stomach, and headache—develop suddenly and disappear after a few days.\n\nIn rare cases, the virus causes a severe infection that produces muscle aches and twitching, and pain and stiffness in the neck, legs, and back. About a week after these initial symptoms, a person can develop paralysis, especially in the lower part of the trunk and in the legs. In severe cases, a person may have difficulty swallowing and breathing as a result of paralysis of the muscles in the throat and chest. The paralysis may be temporary or permanent. Some children have long-term muscle weakness that continues into adulthood, while others have no lasting effects. In some cases, the infection may be fatal.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > Post-Polio Syndrome]\nPost-polio syndrome is a condition that affects about 25 percent of people who have recovered from polio. The syndrome, which occurs from 10 to 40 years after having polio, results from the death of motor neurons (nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control muscle activity) that did not die in the initial infection.\n\nThe symptoms of post-polio syndrome can include fatigue, slowly progressing muscle weakness, muscle and joint pain, difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, and, sometimes, muscle atrophy (shrinking or wasting of the muscles). The severity of the symptoms depends on the severity of the initial polio infection. Post-polio syndrome usually is not life-threatening unless a person's breathing becomes severely impaired.\n\nTo diagnose post-polio syndrome, a doctor usually orders tests such as an MRI (see page 113) to look for changes in the brain or spine or to rule out\n\nother possible neurological disorders, an examination of the electrical activity of the brain (electroencephalogram; see page 687), and a muscle biopsy (microscopic examination of small samples of muscle tissue). He or she may order a lumbar puncture, in which a hollow needle is inserted into the lower back to remove a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord) for examination under a microscope.\n\nThere is no treatment for post-polio syndrome, and the condition cannot be prevented.

The bacteria that cause diphtheria can be spread by sneezing, coughing, or laughing. If not treated promptly, the\n\ninfection can damage the heart, kidneys, and nervous system and can cause permanent disability or death. Diphtheria rarely occurs in the United States because of widespread childhood immunization against the disease. The vaccination is given in a combined vaccine with tetanus and whooping cough (DTaP; see page 376), beginning at 2 months of age and four more times up to age 6 years. Having diphtheria does not provide immunity.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of diphtheria include sore throat, a slight fever, rapid heartbeat, swollen lymph glands in the neck, difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, and, occasionally, a thick, yellow discharge from the nose. In the advanced stages, symptoms can include double vision, slurred speech, paralysis, or shock (see page 579). The most dangerous symptom of diphtheria is a grayish membrane that forms on the throat and tonsils. The membrane may become large enough to cause croup (see page 420) or obstruct breathing. Contact your doctor immediately if your child has symptoms of diphtheria.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of diphtheria is based on a child's symptoms and the results of a physical examination. The doctor may order a blood test or a microscopic examination of secretions from the nose and throat to detect the diphtheria bacteria.\n\nTo treat diphtheria, a child is hospitalized and isolated from other patients to prevent the infection from spreading. He or she is given injections of antibiotics to kill the bacteria, and antitoxins to neutralize the toxins the bacteria produce. In some cases, these medications may be given intravenously (through a vein). If a child's breathing is blocked, a temporary tracheotomy (an airway opening cut into the windpipe) may be necessary to restore breathing, or a child may be put on a ventilator to assist breathing. Supplemental oxygen may also be necessary. If the bacterial toxin spreads to the kidneys, heart, or nervous system, the doctor may prescribe intravenous fluids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce inflammation and assist breathing. The child will need to rest in bed for about 4 to 6 weeks or until he or she has recovered fully.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pinworms]\nPinworms are tiny white worms that frequently infest the intestines of young children. The eggs of pinworms can easily enter a child's body when he or she touches contaminated food or contaminated clothing, toys, or a sandbox. The eggs hatch in the intestines, and young worms quickly begin to grow into adults. About 2 weeks later, a mature female worm lays eggs around the child's anus during the night. This may cause irritation. If the child scratches the area, he or she can pick up some of the eggs on his or her fingers. If the child sucks his or her fingers or eats without washing them thoroughly, he or she can become reinfested. The pinworms can spread to other family members if the child touches food, drinking glasses, sheets, towels, or other shared household items.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nSome children who have pinworms do not have any symptoms. Others experience itching between the buttocks and around the anus, usually at night. Some girls with pinworms may have vaginal itching and may experience pain when urinating. In many children, pinworms interfere with normal sleep.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA diagnosis of pinworms is based on a child's symptoms and the results of a physical examination. Pinworms are sometimes visible in stool or may be visible around the child's anus, especially at night. You can confirm the presence of pinworms by briefly placing a strip of transparent tape across your child's anus in the early morning (before he or she has a bowel movement). Any eggs in the area will stick to the tape. Put the egg-infested tape in a plastic bag and take it to the doctor's office. The doctor can examine it under a microscope to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nBecause pinworms spread easily, the doctor may recommend treating the entire family with prescription medications (antihelminthics) that kill worms. To relieve anal inflammation, the doctor may recommend applying a nonprescription ointment that contains a substance that kills pinworm eggs.\n\nBecause it is relatively easy to become reinfested with pinworms, the doctor will recommend that everyone in the household wash their hands thoroughly and frequently,\n\nespecially after going to the toilet or handling a pet, and before touching food. All family members should cut their fingernails short and keep them short to reduce the risk of spreading the eggs.

Most girls start to go through puberty at about age 11 and boys at age 12 or 13. Precocious puberty is defined as the onset of sexual development before age 8 in girls and 9½ in boys. It occurs in about one out of every 5,000 children and is much more common in girls than in boys.\n\nIn most cases of precocious puberty (especially in girls), sexual development simply occurs earlier than expected, with no known cause. Some boys inherit a gene that brings on early puberty. About 15 percent of cases of precocious puberty result from underlying medical conditions such as central nervous system tumors (see page 682), Albright's syndrome (a disorder characterized by a group of abnormalities including irregular skin-color patches, bone deformities, and early puberty), an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism; see page 903), or adrenal gland disorders.\n\nSome children who start puberty prematurely rapidly grow taller than their peers at first but end up being shorter because the hormonal changes stop their growth before they have reached a normal adult height. Children who develop early often feel different from their peers, which can sometimes cause emotional distress. A child who develops prematurely should be evaluated by his or her doctor.\n\nTo diagnose precocious puberty, doctors use blood tests to measure hormone levels, along with observation of a child's physical changes and a complete physical examination. They may also order X-rays of the hand and wrist, taken in succession over time, to calculate bone growth. An ultrasound examination of the ovaries may be used to help compare the size of a girl's ovaries with the standard size for girls her age. A CT scan or MRI of the brain and abdomen may be done to rule out a brain or abdominal tumor as the cause of precocious puberty.\n\nThe goal of treatment for precocious puberty is to stop and possibly reverse the premature sexual development; the treatment varies depending on the cause. For example, if precocious puberty has resulted from an adrenal gland tumor, removal of the tumor will correct the condition. In most cases, a doctor prescribes a hormone (given by injection or nasal spray) that suppresses the body's production of sex hormones (estrogen in girls; testosterone in boys). Once the hormone treatment is stopped, the body's own\n\nhormone function gradually returns and the process of puberty continues normally.\n\nFemale hormones stimulate an increase in fat all over the body, but mostly on the hips, thighs, and buttocks. Girls have a normally higher proportion of fat to muscle and bone than boys do. Also, a girl's pelvis widens during puberty.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Physical and Sexual Development in Boys]\nIn boys, puberty begins at about age 12 or 13 (and continues until 17 or 18). Puberty can begin as early as 9½ years of age, and continue until 21 years of age in boys who start puberty late. A boy's testicles and scrotum (the pouch of skin and tissue that holds the testicles) usually start to enlarge by age 11 or 12 and stop by age 16 or 17. One testicle may appear to be larger or hang lower than the other; this is normal. As the testicles grow, the skin of the scrotum darkens.\n\nThe penis lengthens before it grows broader at about age 12 or 13; growth stops at about 15 or 16. The ability to ejaculate semen (a fluid produced by the male reproductive organs that contains sperm) begins about a year after the penis starts to grow. At about the time that a boy's penis starts to lengthen and widen, he usually starts having more frequent erections. It is normal to have erections for no apparent reason, although erections usually occur with sexual excitement or physical stimulation. Spontaneous erections generally go away after a few minutes and are not noticeable to anyone else. Some boys (but not all) have erections and ejaculate during their sleep when they are dreaming (nocturnal emissions, or wet dreams), which is a normal part of sexual development. Many boys worry about the size (or shape) of their penis. If changes in the testicles or penis are not noticeable in a boy by age 15, he should see his pediatrician.\n\nPubic hair is visible by age 11 or 12, but underarm hair may not appear until 13 or even 15. As in girls, the development of hair on the body varies from person to person and depends on heredity. Although pubic and underarm hair usually stop growing noticeably by about age 16 (depending on when growth started), hair on the chest and abdomen usually continues growing into adulthood. Sweating and underarm odor, along with the development of sweat glands in the groin, usually are first noticeable between ages 13 and 15.\n\nIn boys and young men, the larynx enlarges, making the Adam's apple more prominent, and the vocal cords become longer and thicker, causing the voice to deepen\n\nat about ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "girls", "relation": "start", "tail": "puberty"}, {"head": "boys", "relation": "start", "tail": "puberty"}, {"head": "precocious puberty", "relation": "result from", "tail": "underlying medical conditions"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "some boys", "relation": "inherit", "tail": "[Event: a gene]"}, {"head": "about 15 percent of cases", "relation": "result from", "tail": "[Event: underlying medical conditions]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

These hormones act on the testicles to increase the secretion of the male sex hormone testosterone and other sex hormones. Testosterone increases muscle and bone mass. Boys may be temporarily shorter and smaller than girls of the same age but usually will be taller and heavier than most girls their age by the time they are 21.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Stages of Puberty in Boys > *Prepuberty*]\nNo signs of sexual development are visible before puberty, but the testicles are preparing to release sex hormones.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Stages of Puberty in Boys > *Early puberty*]\nDuring this stage, the first signs of puberty appear.

The penis grows longer, and boys may be able to ejaculate. Perspiration increases, and underarm hair may start to grow. The testicles continue to grow. Skin is oily, possibly causing acne. Because the vocal cords are starting to grow, the voice may crack or change pitch.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Stages of Puberty in Boys > *Late puberty*]\nPubic hair fills in during late puberty. The penis grows longer and thicker, and the skin of the scrotum and penis darkens. Facial hair starts to grow, mostly on the upper lip and chin. At this stage, a growth spurt takes place, and boys get noticeably taller.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Stages of Puberty in Boys > *Maturity*]\nAt this stage, boys reach physical and sexual maturity (usually between ages 18 and 21). The dramatic growth in height slows considerably. Pubic hair may have spread to cover the inner thighs. Hair may start to grow on the chest.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Stages of Puberty in Boys > Prepuberty]\n![Illustration of a young boy standing, representing the Prepuberty stage.]()![](_page_812_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\nEarly puberty\n\n![Illustration of a young male standing nude, representing the stage of Middle puberty.]()![](_page_813_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n**Middle puberty**\n\n![Illustration of a young male standing nude, representing the stage of Late puberty, showing a more developed pubic area.]()![](_page_813_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\n**Late puberty**\n\n![Line drawing of a male figure standing, representing the state of Maturity.]()![](_page_814_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nMaturity\n\n![Line drawing of a male figure standing, representing the state of Nutrition.]()![](_page_814_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\nNutrition\n\nNot eating the right foods, eating too much, or not eating enough during adolescence can lead to lifelong health problems or life-threatening diseases such as obesity, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and osteoporosis. The tremendous physical growth that occurs during puberty requires good nutrition. To meet their energy needs throughout the day, teens should eat at least three healthy meals, including a good breakfast. Teens often eat on the run. A wide variety of healthful foods available at home—such as fresh fruits, low-fat cheeses and yogurt, and cut-up raw vegetables with a low-fat bean dip or salsa—may help keep teens from eating the high-fat, high-sugar, high-calorie foods they normally reach for first. Sodas and diet sodas have little or no nutritional value.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Calcium*]\nTeens, especially girls, need to eat foods that are high in calcium, such as low-fat dairy products, fish with edible bones (such as salmon and sardines), and dark green vegetables (such as collard greens, broccoli, and kale). They should have three or more servings a day of calcium-rich foods. Nearly all of a person's total bone mass is formed by the end of the teen years. Children who don't take in enough calcium may not develop their maximum potential bone mass. Building optimal bone mass by doing weight-bearing exercise and eating foods high in calcium can help prevent or delay the onset of the bone-thinning disorder osteoporosis (see page 989) later in life.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Iron*]\nThe daily requirement for iron increases dramatically starting at age 10, especially between ages 11 and 18, because of increased muscle mass and an expanded volume of blood. Iron can be found in animal foods such as beef, chicken and turkey (especially the dark meat), or fish. Strict vegetarians (see page 43) can get their daily supply of iron from plant foods such as dried beans, leafy greens, nuts, and dried fruits, but they will have to eat a larger volume of them to get sufficient iron. Adolescent boys need more iron than when they were younger because of their increased growth rate. Girls need even more than boys to replace the iron lost during menstruation. Girls who lose a lot of blood during heavy menstrual periods are at risk of developing iron deficiency anemia (see page 610). Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include fatigue, ir", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "testosterone", "relation": "increases", "tail": "muscle and bone mass"}, {"head": "testosterone", "relation": "increases", "tail": "male sex hormone"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

Teenagers require more sleep—9 to 10 hours a day—than children who are even slightly younger, and more than most adults. It is normal for teenagers to have difficulty falling asleep in the evening and difficulty waking in the morning because their biological clock is “off” in the daytime when they should be awake, and “on” in the evening when they should be sleeping. Adolescents who get 6 to 7 hours of sleep a night fall asleep more often during the day, especially during sedentary activities (such as sitting in a classroom or driving). Cutting back on sleep, even by 1 or 2 hours, has been linked to poor school performance, irritability, and vehicle collisions. Over time, increased levels of the stress hormone\n\ncortisol (brought on by lack of sleep) can damage brain cells directly and cause memory and learning problems.\n\nExposure to bright light (about 30 to 40 minutes first thing in the morning) as well as going to bed and waking up at the same time every day can help reset an adolescent's biological clock. It also helps if teens leave a little time at the end of the day to unwind. They should also limit their intake of caffeine during the day and avoid exercising right before going to bed.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Getting Enough Sleep > Staying Healthy: What Can Parents Do?]\n- Provide nutritious, well-balanced meals (see page 36). Girls especially need to get enough calcium (1,200 to 1,500 milligrams a day) during adolescence to build strong bones.\n- Encourage your child to be physically active with activities such as walking, dancing, or sports.\n- Try to see that your child goes to bed and wakes up at about the same time on weekdays and weekends, and that he or she gets 9 to 10 hours of sleep every day.\n- Make sure that your teen does not take on too many activities. Think of ways to make his or her schedule more manageable, such as working fewer hours or dropping an activity. School, homework, sports, after-school activities, and a job may not provide time for an adequate amount of sleep, time with family, or nutritious meals.\n- Make appointments for your teenager for regular medical checkups. Girls need to start having regular pelvic examinations (see page 140) and Pap smears at age 18—younger if they are or are about to become sexually active, or if they have menstrual problems.\n- Make sure your child is aware of health self-examinations he or she should be performing regularly. Girls should begin doing monthly breast self-examinations (see page 138) by age 18. Boys should begin doing testicle self-examinations (see page 139) at puberty.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Getting Enough Sleep > Adolescent Sexuality]\nParents often have unrealistic views of their children's sexuality and are unaware that their children are sexually active. However, most adolescents experiment with relationships and sex and, by the time they graduate from high school, many have had sexual experiences. It is important for parents to talk with their children about relationships, including the roles of sex, self-respect, and love. The more knowledge adolescents have about sex (including about contraception and safer sex), the less likely they are to engage in irresponsible or early sexual activity. Parents who find it difficult to talk about sex (or are not sure what to say) should ask their doctor to talk to their teen for them or ask the doctor to recommend a book to give to the teenager on the subject. However, parents should be available and willing to discuss any questions their children (of any age) have.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Getting Enough Sleep > Pregnancy: A Responsibility of Both Partners]\nAdolescents who are having sex should actively prevent an unwanted pregnancy. Each year in the United States, nearly 800,000 unintended pregnancies occur in girls 15 to 19 years old. A boy and a girl should both use contraception (see page 470)—including for their first experience with sexual intercourse. It is possible for a girl to become pregnant even if she has not begun menstruating because the first egg could be released from an ovary (and fertilized by the boy's sperm) in the days before she has her first period.\n\nMost teenagers are not adequately educated about their reproductive potential and the risk of unintended pregnancy.

Having this knowledge can give your teen self-confidence and enable him or her to make responsible decisions about sex. Here are some tips:\n\n- Make sure your children are well informed about sex.\n- Encourage your children to ask questions about sex, and give them honest answers.\n- Stress that there are other ways than sex to have a close relationship with someone. Suggest going dancing or to movies, plays, or sporting events; participating in sports; or going out with a group of friends.\n- Explain the risks of oral sex. Many teenagers think they are “abstaining” from sex by engaging in nonintercourse sexual activities. They don’t realize that they can contract many sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)—including chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, genital warts, and HIV—through oral sex.\n- Explain the risks of sexual intercourse, including pregnancy and STDs. Teenagers also need to know where they can be treated for STDs, and that not all STDs can be cured. Emphasize the importance of reporting an STD to a doctor so that all of their sexual contacts can be located and treated. Stress that they themselves would want to know if they had been exposed to an STD, and that all such reports are kept confidential.\n- Inform your teen about all available contraceptive techniques (see page 470). Condoms help prevent pregnancy and provide some protection against STDs. If you are not sure about the facts, refer your child to a family planning\n\nclinic such as Planned Parenthood. Reassure your child that all health visits and records are confidential.\n\n- Accept your child's sexuality; if your child tells you that he or she is homosexual (or if you think he or she may be), accept the possibility and get information and support from a support organization such as Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Psychological, Emotional, and Behavioral Development]\nThe physical, mental, and emotional changes that take place during adolescence can make it an especially difficult time for both the adolescent and his or her parents. At the same time that relationships are getting more complicated, classes are getting harder and peer pressure is at its peak.\n\nIndependence is necessary for healthy growth, and it helps teens learn to make good choices. Most teens get through these years safely by learning through experience, sometimes making some bad choices that have no long-term, harmful consequences. Adolescents learn to become independent by expressing their individuality in a number of ways, such as through music, clothes, or hairstyles. These forms of rebellion are often part of a teenager's growth toward independence and maturity. In some cases, however, teens make poor choices, or their life experiences become too difficult for them to handle. Other teens may develop psychological or emotional problems that require treatment by mental health professionals.\n\nThe severity of a teen's behavior or emotions is usually what distinguishes the average teen from one who has psychological or emotional problems. Here are some ways to tell if your teen's behavior is normal or if he or she is having problems coping. Most teens:\n\n- Are sad sometimes or cry easily—but their mood eventually improves.\n- Worry about their appearance and experiment with diets or exercise programs—but don't jeopardize their health.\n- Skip a class or two—but not enough to fail a class or get poor grades.\n- Worry about their popularity—but not to the point where they are unable to deal with everyday life.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Mental and Emotional Health in Teens: What Can Parents Do?]\nAlthough their friends and peers are of increasing importance, for most teenagers, parents and family are the most important influences. Use your influence to help your children face the many choices and decisions they have to make at this time in their lives.\n\n- Be available, both physically and emotionally. Spend as much time as you can with your children.\n- Show affection. Hug or kiss your children or use words to show that you care about them.\n- Compliment teenagers often and tell them you are proud of them.\n- Set clear, reasonable expectations for your children.\n- Be a good role model. Behave in the way you want your children to behave.\n- Spend more time listening than talking. Showing an interest in what your children have to say makes them feel important and boosts their self-esteem.\n- Don't be judgmental. Accepting your children's ideas and feelings will make them more likely to confide in you.\n- Do not compare your child to other children.\n- Never ridicule your child.\n- Give advice, not orders.

The average smoker starts by age 12 and smokes daily by age 14. Teens usually start smoking because their friends do, they think it's cool, and it makes them seem older. Boys often think it makes them look manly, and many girls do it to look glamorous and to control their weight.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Smoking and Using Tobacco > What Teens Should Know About Smoking and Tobacco]\nTeens who smoke rarely respond to warnings about the health effects of smoking because most problems develop only after many years of smoking. Try to get your teen to stop smoking or using other tobacco products (or not to start) by stressing the negative effects that are most important to him or her now:\n\n- **Attractiveness** Few teens want to date someone who smokes. They say that seeing someone smoke turns them off and that they don't like being around smokers.\n- **Image** Smoking causes bad breath; stained teeth; smelly hair and clothes; wrinkled, dry skin; and red, itchy, watery eyes. Smokeless tobacco can cause cracked lips and sores around the mouth. Teens who smoke produce more than twice as much phlegm as nonsmokers.\n- **Enjoyment** Smoking ruins the smell and taste of food, for the smoker and for others.\n- **Endurance** All forms of tobacco, including smokeless tobacco and cigars, can affect endurance and overall athletic performance by\n\nnarrowing blood vessels, straining the heart, and reducing oxygen to the muscles and lungs.\n\n- **Poison factor** Cigarettes contain poisons such as nicotine (which is also used in insecticides to kill insects), formaldehyde (the chemical used in biology classes to preserve dead animals), and cyanide (the same chemical found in rat poison).\n- **Cost** It's expensive to smoke.\n\nFor some teens, using tobacco can be an early warning sign of other problems. Smoking is associated with high-risk behaviors such as fighting and having unprotected sex. Teens who smoke are more likely than nonsmokers to drink alcohol, smoke marijuana, or use cocaine.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Alcohol and Other Drugs]\nAlcohol is the drug most commonly abused by teens. Many teens drink alcohol regularly and, of those who do, many drink heavily. Binge drinking (having more than five drinks in a session for males or four drinks in a session for females) is a serious problem on most college campuses. Almost half of teens have tried marijuana. Other drugs less frequently abused by teens include amphetamines, heroin, and cocaine (see page 737).\n\nProblems with alcohol and other drugs are occurring at increasingly younger ages. Teens whose parents use alcohol or other drugs are more likely to use them too. Teens use alcohol and other drugs for some of the same reasons adults do—they think it will relax them, give them self-confidence, or help them feel better temporarily. Some teens try alcohol and drugs out of curiosity, or because their friends do and they want to fit in. Many teens who abuse alcohol or drugs have behavioral problems or learning disabilities (see page 415).\n\nThe average teen may experiment with alcohol or marijuana but will not use it regularly. If drug use progresses beyond the stage of experimentation, the teen's behavior will be affected as getting high becomes more and more important. Young people are especially vulnerable to the effects of drug use because their body and brain are still developing. As teens become psychologically or physically dependent on drugs, they tend to spend a lot of time alone or disappear for long periods, and their friends and interests change. They often become depressed and unmotivated and their grades fall. Drug use can also lead to hostility, violence, and delinquency.\n\nIt's hard for teens to deal with drug or alcohol abuse problems by themselves. They might think that they don't drink much or that addictions happen only to other people. Here are some steps you can take to help a teen realize that he or she may have a substance abuse problem:\n\n- Find out before you talk to the teen where he or she could go for help. Be prepared to offer the information.\n- Tell the teen at an appropriate time (preferably when he or she is not under the influence) that you think alcohol or other drugs are causing problems for him or her and you are worried and want to help.\n- Don't accuse the teen of being an alcoholic or drug addict, and don't blame him or her for the problem.\n- Don't show pity or be condescending.\n- Give examples of what you've seen him or her do when he or she is high.\n- Be prepared for the teen's anger and denials.\n- Encourage the teen to talk to other people who have recovered from substance abuse problems.\n- Try to get the teen to see a counselor who specializes in substance abuse problems. The child's safety, health, and life may depend on it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Inhalants*]\nAn increasing ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "smoking", "relation": "treats", "tail": "health effects"}, {"head": "smoking", "relation": "causes", "tail": "problems"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "teens", "relation": "participate in", "tail": "[Event: smoking]"}, {"head": "parents", "relation": "encourage to stop", "tail": "[Event: quitting smoking]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: smoking]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: health problems]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Hold them and administer them to your child inside the home, and do not allow your child to take medicine to school unless your doctor has told you it is necessary. If your child must take his or her medicine at school, make sure the medicine is held by the school nurse and administered in his or her presence or in the presence of a school official. If your child is attending day care, camp, or a sleepover, give his or her medicine to a responsible adult to give to your child when needed.\n\nMethylphenidate can be dangerous if snorted, injected, or taken in large doses. The drug can increase heart rate and blood pressure and, in severe cases, cause an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia; see page 580) that can result in sudden death. Complications from injecting the drug include overdose, blood clots, infections, lung problems, and skin and circulatory problems. Injecting crushed tablets of the drug can cause permanent lung damage.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > Irresponsible Driving]\nMotor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death of teenagers in the United States. Most teens believe they are good drivers. The main reasons for irresponsible driving are immaturity and lack of driving experience—the crash risk for a 16-year-old is more than twice that of an 18- or 19-year-old. Two out of three teens killed in motor vehicle crashes are boys. However, the crash rate for teenage girls is approaching that of boys.\n\nThe majority of motor vehicle deaths are caused by driving while under the influence of alcohol. One out of five teenage drivers has driven while drunk, and one out of five teens involved in fatal crashes had been drinking. Other factors in addition to drinking that contribute to motor vehicle injuries or deaths are speeding, not wearing a seat belt, and being distracted while driving. Three out of four teens admit to speeding while driving, and many teens say they rarely or never wear a seat belt. Being distracted can contribute to or cause a collision; cars carrying two or more teens are four times more likely to be involved in a collision than cars carrying only the teen driver.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Safe Driving: Tips for Parents of Teens Who Drive]\nTo reduce collisions and injuries, many states are establishing graduated licensing systems in which full driving privileges are phased in for 16-year-olds. In the initial phase, the teen may be allowed to drive only with adult supervision, and parents must certify that their child has driven a specified number of hours (usually 25 to 50 hours) under supervision. In the next phase, the teen is able to drive without adult supervision but may be restricted from driving at night or from driving with nonadult passengers. These phases usually last about 6 months, but may last longer depending on the state. Many states require driver education as part of their graduated licensing system.\n\n- Have your teen drive under supervision (with an adult in the car as a passenger) for at least 50 hours before letting him or her get a driver's license. Observe his or her driving in all kinds of weather conditions and traffic situations.\n- Establish rules early for safe driving. Take away your child's driving privileges if he or she breaks a rule, especially if he or she gets a speeding ticket or causes a collision.\n- Set a good example by following all traffic rules and by controlling your anger on the road.\n- Have your teen drive a nonflashy, nonsporty car. He or she will be less likely to show off or speed.\n- Tell your teen to call for a ride any time he or she (or another driver) is not capable of driving, no matter the circumstances, including drinking. Assure him or her that there will be no consequences or punishment.\n- Remind your teen to follow all traffic rules—such as wearing a seat belt at all times, not speeding, not weaving in and out of traffic, and especially not drinking any alcohol before getting behind the wheel. He or she also should insist that all passengers wear seat belts.\n- Remind your teen of the importance of focusing on driving and of avoiding unnecessary distractions such as talking on the phone, adjusting the radio or CD player, putting on makeup, eating, or looking at a map. He or she should pull over to use the phone or study maps or notes for directions.\n\n- Discourage your child from driving or riding on a motorcycle. If he or she does, insist that he or she wear a helmet and other proper equipment or clothing.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Depression]\nFeeling sad or down every once in a while is normal, but being depressed is not a normal part of adolescence.

Exposure to violence (either actual or through media such as movies) can rewire a child's brain in ways that can make him or her more prone to aggressive behavior later in life. There is no precise profile of someone who will commit acts of violence but, in addition to exposure to violence, risk factors include alcohol or drug abuse, being a victim of child abuse or neglect, being a gang member, and having access to a gun. In the United States, guns are responsible for most of the deaths of people between ages 15 and 24. Violent behavior usually peaks by age 16 or 17, but the vast majority of teens who have been violent stop committing violent acts by the time they are 21.\n\nIt is usually the interaction of a number of influences over time that can make a teen violent. Good parenting and the love and acceptance of even just one caring adult can often help teens gain confidence and social skills, set positive goals to strive for, and serve as buffers against potentially harmful biological or environmental influences.\n\n**WARNING!**\n\n**Could Your Child Become Violent?**\n\nViolent teens may show signs of having emotional or behavioral problems long before they behave violently. Consult a doctor or mental health professional if a child or teen:\n\n- Damages property\n- Hurts animals\n- Frequently loses his or her temper or gets into fights\n- Carries a weapon or is a member of a gang\n- Bullies another child (or is being bullied)\n- Abuses alcohol or other drugs\n- Is easily frustrated and feels that he or she is being treated unfairly\n- Has low self-esteem and seems depressed\n- Seems to have no friends and is often alone\n- Is verbally abusive or threatens others\n- Is truant or has a history of discipline problems in school\n- Has extreme mood swings or has talked about committing suicide\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Bullying*]\nNearly half of all schoolchildren are bullied by another student at some time during their education. Bullying is defined as a pattern of repeated aggression against or negative behavior toward a person. Boys are more likely to be bullies than girls, and boys usually bully other boys; girls tend to bully other girls. Bullying can take the form of physical attacks (such as hitting, kicking, or pushing), verbal attacks (such as name-calling, insults, or teasing), or psychological attacks (such as intimidation, spreading rumors, or persuading other children to reject or exclude the child). Boys who are bullies usually use physical force or threats, while girls are more likely to use verbal or psychological attacks.\n\nBullies are usually children who have themselves been victims of physical abuse or bullying, usually at home. They tend to be aggressive, controlling, and dominating, and often have an inflated self-image and difficulty empathizing with other people. By contrast, the victims of bullying tend to be introverted, passive, and easily intimidated, and frequently are seen by classmates as being different in some way (such as by race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, academic ability, or unusual haircut or clothing).\n\nIf you think that your child is a victim of bullying, or if you are concerned that your child may be a bully, quickly take steps to stop it. Bullying can have long-term\n\nconsequences for both victims and bullies. Victims of bullying often try to avoid going to school, and their academic performance may suffer. Many victims have difficulty socializing, have low self-esteem, and frequently become isolated and depressed. In extreme cases, victims may consider or attempt suicide (see previous page). Children who are bullies are more likely than other children to be truant from school, drop out of school, or get into fights. They also are more likely than other children to commit a crime (such as vandalism, shoplifting, or drug-related offenses) by the time they are 24.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Bullying* > **If your child is being bullied:**]\n- **Believe your child.** Reassure your child and make sure he or she knows that you care. Listen to what he or she has to say, and ask questions so you can get a clear understanding of the situation.\n- **Get help.** Talk to your child's teacher and the school principal, and ask them to investigate the situation. They may be able to reduce the incidence of bullying by increasing supervision in areas where it is most likely to occur, including hallways, bathrooms, locker rooms, playgrounds, and school buses.\n\n- **Encourage your child to be assertive.** Tell your child to get immediate help from an adult when he or she is confronted by a bully.

A satisfying sexual relationship is one of the most important aspects of life. The shared intimacy of sex can be a physically and emotionally rewarding experience. Sexual arousal is influenced by our feelings of attraction to another person and involves physical responses such as an erection or vaginal lubrication.\n\nSexual arousal affects the whole body. The skin is highly sensitive to arousal, especially the skin over the upper and inner thighs, the lower back, and the buttocks. During arousal, the genitals, earlobes, and nipples in both men and women become erect, and the lining of the nose becomes swollen and engorged with blood. The contractions of orgasm affect many muscles in the body, including those in the legs, back, neck, face, and toes.\n\nBecause the female sex organs are more interior than the male sex organs, some women may be unfamiliar with their own genitals. If you are a woman who has never seen her external genitals, you can look at them with a small mirror held between your legs. Your pubic hair covers the protective tissue known as the mons pubis, which lies over the external genitals. Underneath are two folds of skin called the outer lips or labia. Inside the outer labia are two inner lips, which cover the openings to the urinary tract and the vagina. The clitoris, the principal site of female sexual stimulation, is at the top, where the inner lips meet; the clitoris, like a man's penis, becomes erect and swollen during sexual arousal. The vagina is a long, muscular canal that extends (at an angle) from the outside of the body up to the uterus. At the upper end of the vagina is the cervix, which is the opening of the uterus. During arousal, the vagina produces a fluid that lubricates it and makes penetration by the penis easier.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sexuality > The female sex organs]\nMost of the female reproductive system is internal—and only the genitals are visible. The outer, visible area is called the vulva, which includes the mons pubis (the hair-covered mound over the pubic bone); the outer, hair-covered lips (labia majora); and the smaller, inner lips (labia minora), which protect the opening to the vagina. The clitoris is a tiny, sexually sensitive mound of tissue. During sexual arousal, the clitoris,\n\nthe labia minora, the vagina, and the network of connecting blood vessels and muscles swell with blood.\n\n![Diagram of the male external genitalia showing the Mons pubis, Outer labia, Inner labia, Clitoris, Opening to urethra, and Opening to vagina.]()![](_page_841_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nFor the most part, the male sex organs are external. The penis passes urine out of the body and expels semen (a mixture of sperm and secretions from the seminal vesicles and prostate gland) at orgasm. When a male is unaroused sexually, the penis is soft, but during arousal, blood rushes into the penis, making it swollen and erect. Sperm are produced in the testicles, two round, firm spheres enclosed in a pouch of skin called the scrotum. The testicles are outside the body because they must be cooler than body temperature to produce sperm. The left testicle usually hangs slightly lower than the right testicle. On top of each testicle is a coiled tube called the epididymis, in which sperm develop.\n\nFrom the back of each testicle, a long, thin tube called the vas deferens extends up into an organ called the ampulla of the vas deferens, which is behind the bladder. The ampulla of the vas deferens stores sperm for up to several months. Right before ejaculation, sperm exit the ampulla and mix with secretions from the seminal vesicles. As the mixture enters the urethra (the tube inside the penis through which urine passes out of the body), it combines with secretions from the prostate gland. This final mixture is called semen. The penis ejects semen as orgasm begins.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sexuality > The male sex organs]\nThe penis and the testicles are the most visible parts of the male reproductive system. The testicles are suspended in a pouch of skin called the scrotum. The testicles produce sperm and the male sex hormone testosterone. During sexual arousal, spongy tissue inside the penis becomes engorged with blood. Sperm travel from the testicles through a duct called the vas deferens into a pair of sacs called the seminal vesicles. The prostate gland and seminal vesicles produce a fluid that combines with the sperm to create semen—the fluid that is ejaculated at orgasm.\n\n![Diagram of the male reproductive system showing labeled parts: Bladder, Seminal vesicle, Prostate gland, Pubic bone, Vas deferens, Urethra, Spongy erectile tissue, Penis, Epididymis, Testicle, and Scrotum.]()![](_page_842_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Sexual Response Cycle]\nMen and women experience a pr", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Sexuality", "relation": "affects", "tail": "the whole body"}, {"head": "sexual arousal", "relation": "influenced by", "tail": "our feelings of attraction to another person"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

During orgasm, heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure reach their highest levels. The skin may become flushed or appear to have a rash. In women, the muscles in the vagina contract rhythmically, producing pleasurable sensations. The uterus also contracts during orgasm. Women are capable of having multiple orgasms.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Orgasm > What Happens During Orgasm?]\nOrgasm can be defined as a peak of pressure in the blood vessels and tissues of the genitals that is characterized by pleasurable muscle contractions in the genitals and over the entire body.\n\nWhen a woman reaches orgasm, the muscles in the lower third of the vagina contract repeatedly, while those in the upper third expand. The uterus also contracts during orgasm. To achieve orgasm, a woman must get sufficient stimulation at the base of her clitoris, but only 20 to 30 percent of all women are able to reach orgasm during intercourse with penetration of the penis alone. For a woman, having an orgasm during intercourse depends on the anatomy of both partners and the activity they engage in. Some couples fit together and move in a way that stimulates the clitoris; others do not. If you are a woman who has difficulty having an orgasm during intercourse, ask your partner to stimulate your clitoris with a finger, the mouth, or a vibrator beforehand so you can be sufficiently aroused. You can also try different positions to see if they are more stimulating, or masturbate during\n\npenetration. Many women can achieve orgasm more easily when they are on top.\n\nWhen a man becomes sexually aroused, his brain sends signals to relax the muscles in his penis so blood can rush in and fill the penis sufficiently to produce an erection. Just before orgasm, the muscles around the base of the penis contract to help eject semen from the penis. After these pleasurable muscle contractions, he enters a period of relaxation in which he cannot respond to sexual stimulation.\n\nThe male orgasm occurs in two parts. First, semen collects in the urethra and the man feels that orgasm is inevitable. Then the penis contracts and expels the semen. Each ejaculation contains from 300 million to 500 million sperm, but only a few hundred will reach the woman's fallopian tubes.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Resolution]\nDuring the resolution stage, the heightened state of arousal reverts to normal. The sex organs return to their normal size. Breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure decrease to their normal levels. This process usually takes longer for women, and women can be stimulated to reach another orgasm during this stage. Men go through a refractory period during which they cannot have another orgasm until a certain amount of time has passed. This refractory period can last from minutes to hours depending on the man's age and physical condition.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sexual Orientation]\nSexual orientation is a term that refers to a person's emotional, romantic, and sexual attraction to a person of a particular gender. People who are attracted to members of the opposite sex are called heterosexual, while those who are attracted to people of the same sex are called homosexual, gay (men and women), or lesbian (women). Some people are attracted to both men and women; they are called bisexual. It is difficult to determine the exact number of people in the United States who identify themselves as homosexual or bisexual.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Bisexuality and Homosexuality]\nThe factors that influence a person's sexual orientation are not completely understood, but they appear to encompass a complex combination of biological, psychological, and social influences. What is clear is that sexual orientation is not a lifestyle choice that can easily be changed. Most people discover at a very early age—in childhood or adolescence—before they have had any sexual experiences, that they are attracted to people of a certain gender.\n\nTo avoid the social stigma sometimes attached to being homosexual, some gay people try hard to change their sexual orientation, usually without success. No scientific evidence shows that trying to alter one's sexual orientation is an appropriate goal of psychological or psychiatric treatment. Homosexuality and bisexuality are not mental disorders or emotional problems. Doctors view homosexuality and bisexuality as normal variations of human sexual expression. Most emotional problems that occur in homosexuals are caused by a sense of alienation from living in an unaccepting environment.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Discrimination and Coming Out]\nGay people frequently face discrimination and stereotyping in the United States. Hate crimes and similar acts of violence pose a genuine threat. Between 5 and 10 percent of gay people report having experienced physical assault or abuse because of their sexual orientation, and almost half have been victims", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Orgasm", "relation": "is the climax stage of", "tail": "the sexual response cycle"}, {"head": "heart rate", "relation": "reach their highest levels during", "tail": "orgasm"}, {"head": "breathing", "relation": "reach their highest levels during", "tail": "orgasm"}, {"head": "blood pressure", "relation": "reach their highest levels during", "tail": "orgasm"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "women", "relation": "are capable of having multiple", "tail": "[Event: orgasms]"}, {"head": "the muscles in the vagina", "relation": "contract rhythmically producing pleasurable sensations during", "tail": "[Event: orgasm]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: heart rate reaches its highest level]", "relation": "during", "tail": "[Event: orgasm]"}, {"head": "[Event: breathing reaches its highest level]", "relation": "during", "tail": "[Event: orgasm]"}, {"head": "[Event: blood pressure reaches its highest level]", "relation": "during", "tail": "[Event: orgasm]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Some contraceptives require a prescription, while others are available over the counter. Be sure to talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of each method of birth control before choosing one. Consider reliability, side effects, and protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs; see page 477) when making your decision. Remember that hormonal and barrier methods of birth control do not protect against STDs. Doctors strongly recommend that women who use these birth-control methods and are not in a mutually monogamous\n\nrelationship also use condoms during sexual intercourse to protect themselves from STDs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Oral Contraceptives]\nThe contraceptive pill (birth-control pill) is currently the most effective method of reversible birth control. The most frequently prescribed birth-control pills are called combined pills because they blend synthetic versions of estrogen and progesterone (progestin). Estrogen and progesterone are the major hormones that control the female reproductive cycle.\n\nBirth-control pills work primarily by preventing ovulation, the monthly release of an egg by the ovaries. The pills also make it difficult for sperm to enter the uterus by making the mucus produced by the cervix thicker and harder to penetrate. Birth-control pills regulate a woman's menstrual cycle by providing a controlled dose of hormones daily. Most women notice changes in their menstrual cycle when they take birth-control pills—their periods occur precisely every 28 days and usually are shorter and lighter. Many women take birth-control pills specifically to regulate their cycle and reduce menstrual flow, not just for contraception.\n\nIn addition to preventing pregnancy, birth-control pills have other beneficial effects. A woman who takes birth-control pills is much less likely to have ovarian cysts (see page 864), breast lumps (see page 856), iron deficiency anemia (see page 610), rheumatoid arthritis (see page 918), or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID; see page 871) than a woman who does not take birth-control pills. Birth-control pills also protect against cancer of the ovary, uterus, and colon. The combined pill, because it contains estrogen, helps maintain bone density in women who are at risk for osteoporosis (see page 989) and can prevent ectopic pregnancies (see page 523).\n\nBirth-control pills are packaged in 21-day or 28-day packs. The pills you take for the first 3 weeks contain the hormones that prevent pregnancy and regulate your menstrual cycle. The pills you take during the fourth week are inactive (placebo) pills. You take one pill every day at the same time. After you take the last of the hormone-containing pills, the hormone levels in your blood fall quickly, and menstrual bleeding occurs. If you miss a pill, you should take it as soon as you remember. If you miss two or more pills from one package, take two pills a day until you catch up, but use an additional method of birth control until you begin a new package of pills. When you miss a pill, the\n\nsudden withdrawal of the hormones can cause menstrual bleeding. Birth-control pills do not have any effect on your ability to become pregnant after you stop taking them.\n\nIf your doctor has recommended against taking the combined pill, you may be able to take the minipill. The minipill contains only the hormone progesterone (progestin) and may be safer if you smoke and are over age 35. (Women over 35 who smoke cigarettes should not take estrogen because it can increase their risk of blood clots and stroke.) Because the minipill does not contain estrogen, it can cause breakthrough bleeding (bleeding between periods), especially if you miss a pill or take one late. Some women who take the minipill do not have regular menstrual periods for a long time. Minipills are slightly less effective than combined birth-control pills; on average, about 2 of every 100 women who use the minipill for a year become pregnant.\n\nYour doctor probably will tell you to begin taking the ", "response": {"entity_entity": [], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

They are available over the counter as cream, jelly, or foam and are inserted into the vagina shortly before intercourse. Follow the package directions and reinsert more spermicide before each time you have intercourse. Always use a spermicide with a condom, a diaphragm, or a cervical cap. Very rarely, spermicides can cause mild allergic reactions, producing itching and redness in either partner's genital area.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragm]\nThe diaphragm is a rubber cup fitted over a flexible wire frame that blocks sperm from entering the uterus. A trained health care professional fits a diaphragm to a woman's vagina to cover the cervix (the opening to the uterus) and shows her how to use it. A diaphragm must be inserted correctly and no more than 6 hours before intercourse. You must put a ring of spermicidal cream or jelly around the edge of the diaphragm and about half a teaspoon in its center before you insert it. To insert it, you squeeze it together into a half circle. Check immediately after insertion to make sure that the rubber of the diaphragm covers your cervix and that the edge of the diaphragm is behind your pubic bone. If the diaphragm does not cover your cervix, it will not block sperm from the uterus and you can become pregnant.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragm > Using a diaphragm]\nBefore using your diaphragm, place some spermicide around the rim and in the center of the cup (top). When inserted properly, the diaphragm completely covers the cervix, and the rim of the diaphragm lies behind your pubic bone (bottom).\n\n![Diagram showing a hand holding a tube labeled 'Spermicide' and applying it to a 'Diaphragm'.]()![](_page_853_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n![Diagram showing a cross-section of the female reproductive system (Uterus and Vagina) with a 'Diaphragm in place against cervix'.]()![](_page_853_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nAfter intercourse, you must leave the diaphragm in place for at least 6 hours to allow the spermicide to kill any sperm. If you have intercourse again within 6 hours, put more spermicidal cream or jelly in your vagina, using the plastic applicator that comes with the spermicide. For intercourse after 6 hours, remove the diaphragm, wash it, put spermicidal cream or jelly on it again, and reposition it in your vagina. The diaphragm can be a highly effective method of birth control if you use it carefully and consistently.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragm > Cervical Cap]\nThe cervical cap, like the diaphragm, blocks sperm from the uterus. The cap is much smaller than the diaphragm and fits tightly over the cervix (the opening to the uterus) rather than extending to the walls of the vagina. A trained health care professional fits the cervical cap to each woman and instructs her in how to insert it. The cervical cap should be used in the same way as a diaphragm, with spermicidal cream or jelly, following the same precautions. Used in this way, a cervical cap is about as effective as\n\na diaphragm in preventing pregnancy. However, the smaller size of the cap can make it trickier to place correctly, especially for women who have short fingers.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragm > Cervical cap]\nThe cervical cap is a barrier method of birth control. Like a diaphragm but smaller, the cap completely covers the cervix, blocking sperm from entering the uterus.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the cervical cap inserted into the vagina, covering the cervix, and blocking the uterus. Labels include: Cap in position over cervix, Uterus, and Vagina.]()![](_page_854_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragm > IUD]\nThe intrauterine device (IUD) is a tiny contraceptive device made of copper or a hormone-containing plastic that your doctor inserts into your uterus. An IUD prevents pregnancy by blocking sperm from the fallopian tubes, where fertilization normally takes place. An IUD is usually inserted during a woman's menstrual period, when the cervix (the opening to the uterus) is more open, but it can be inserted at any time of the menstrual cycle once the doctor determines that the woman is not pregnant.\n\nThe insertion takes only a few minutes, but it sometimes causes brief cramping pain. Once inserted, the IUD protects against pregnancy. An IUD can be accidentally expelled at any time, so you should check frequently to make sure it is still in place. A good time to check is toward the end of your period (because both menstrual cramps and tampon insertion and removal can increase the risk of expulsion). You can check for the IUD by inserting your finger inside your vagina; if you can feel the string, the IUD is in place. If you feel the hard plastic of the IUD, it is being expelled. See your doctor so he or she can remove the IUD and replace it with a new one.\n\nThe most common problem with copper IUDs is the slight risk of increased menstrual bleeding and intensified menstrual pain, although most users do not experience these pro", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Spermicides", "relation": "treats", "tail": "mild allergic reactions"}, {"head": "Spermicides", "relation": "cause", "tail": "itching and redness"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

The ring continuously releases estrogen and a form of progestosterone (progestin) to inhibit ovulation and block implantation of a fertilized egg. The ring stays in place for 3 weeks, and you remove it for the week that you have your period. You insert a new ring at the end of the fourth week. The ring is easier to insert and remove than a diaphragm (see page 471) because it does not require special positioning over the cervix. It is 99 percent effective in preventing pregnancy (but check regularly to make sure it has not been accidentally expelled).\n\nSide effects of the vaginal ring include vaginal discharge or discomfort, or the sensation of a foreign body inside the vagina. Like the birth-control pill, the vaginal ring can increase the risk of blood clots, heart attack, and stroke, especially in women over age 35 who smoke cigarettes.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Natural Methods]\nThe natural method of contraception, sometimes called the rhythm method, attempts to prevent pregnancy by predicting the day in the menstrual cycle when a woman will ovulate and abstaining from intercourse on the potentially unsafe days before and after. Intercourse on the day of ovulation and 3 to 4 days before and after carries a high risk of conception because sperm can live in a woman's body for as long as 6 days after intercourse (an average of 4 days). A sperm can fertilize an egg during the first 24 hours after ovulation.\n\nNatural birth-control methods are the least reliable form of contraception because they depend on an estimate of the time of ovulation; each woman's menstrual cycle can vary from month to month, and some women may ovulate more than once during a cycle. You will need to keep records over several months to be able to accurately estimate the pattern of your cycle. There are several ways to calculate the time of ovulation, which occurs in most women about 14 days before the first day of their period.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Temperature Method*]\nIn most women, morning temperature (called basal body temperature) rises slightly just after ovulation and does not fall again until shortly before their period begins. Take your temperature each day as soon as you wake up—before you get out of bed or eat or drink anything—using a special thermometer designed to record small changes in temperature. Keep a chart of each temperature recording to determine your pattern of ovulation. Avoid intercourse from the first day of a period until 3 full days after the temperature rise. The disadvantages to this method are that you have no warning when ovulation will occur, and temperature readings can be inaccurate.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Ovulation-Predictor Kits]\nOvulation-predictor kits are available over the counter to help you determine when you are ovulating. To use, hold a test strip under your stream of urine and check the strip's change of color according to the package directions. To prevent pregnancy, avoid having intercourse for 3 to 4 days before and after ovulation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Ovulation-Predictor Kits > *Mucus-Inspection Method*]\nAbout 4 days before ovulation, the mucus from the cervix becomes thin, clear, sticky, and plentiful, similar to the consistency of egg whites. To prevent pregnancy, avoid intercourse from the time the wet mucus appears until 4 days after the mucus becomes noticeably reduced and drier after ovulation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Ovulation-Predictor Kits > *Mucothermal Method*]\nThe mucothermal method combines the temperature method and the mucus-inspection method (see previous page). It is the most reliable natural method, especially when performed with the guidance of a trained health care professional. But you must avoid intercourse for at least 3 days after your temperature rises and for 4 days after your mucus thins.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Ovulation-Predictor Kits > *Calendar Method*]\nThe calendar method is the least reliable natural method. To detect ovulation, you keep an accurate record of the lengths of your cycles for at least 12 months. Count the first day of your period as day 1. Subtract 20 days from your shortest menstrual cycle to determine the first day of your fertile time and then subtract 10 days from your longest cycle to find the last day of your fertile time each month. The calendar method is impractical if you have an irregular menstrual cycle; you would need to abstain from intercourse most days of the month.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sterilization]\nIf you are certain that you do not want children in the future, sterilization is an almost completely safe and reliable form of birth control. Most doctors recommend male rather than female sterilization because it carries less risk and is simpler to perform. Because both sterilization procedures seal off only the tubes that carry sperm or eggs, they ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "vaginal ring", "relation": "prevents", "tail": "pregnancy"}, {"head": "estrogen", "relation": "releases", "tail": "progestin"}, {"head": "progestin", "relation": "inhibits", "tail": "ovulation"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "you", "relation": "insert", "tail": "[Event: insert vaginal ring]"}, {"head": "you", "relation": "remove", "tail": "[Event: remove vaginal ring]"}, {"head": "you", "relation": "check", "tail": "[Event: check for expulsion]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: insert vaginal ring]", "relation": "stays in place for", "tail": "[Event: 3 weeks]"}, {"head": "[Event: remove vaginal ring]", "relation": "insert new ring at the end of", "tail": "[Event: fourth week]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Although most STDs are transmitted through vaginal or anal intercourse, other forms of sexual contact, such as oral sex, can also transmit some STDs. Although anyone who is sexually active can contract an STD, about two thirds of people who have STDs are age 25 or younger. About 15 million new STD cases occur each year in the United States.\n\nFactors that increase your risk of contracting an STD include having more than one sex partner, having a sex partner who has more than one sex partner, not using condoms (see next page), and having a history of other STDs. To reduce your risk of contracting an STD, abstain from sex or limit the number of sex partners you have and use a latex condom every time you have vaginal, oral, or anal sex.\n\nAll STDs can be treated, and most can be cured. If you have symptoms or think that you may have been exposed to an STD, contact your doctor, your local health department, or an STD or family planning clinic (such as Planned Parenthood) for confidential testing and treatment. If you are sexually active and are not in a monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner, you should be tested for STDs regularly. Because STDs often occur together, people who have one STD should be tested for others.\n\nWhile you are being treated for an STD, you still can pass the infection to a sex partner. And even after successful treatment, you can easily become reinfected through sexual contact with an infected partner. For these reasons, your doctor will recommend that you and your partner be treated at the same time and that you both avoid all sexual contact until your treatment has been completed and you have no symptoms. Your doctor will tell you when it is safe to resume sexual activity.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Safer Sex]\nAbstinence (not having sex) is the only sure way to protect yourself from STDs. However, if you are sexually active, taking the following precautions will significantly reduce your risk of contracting an STD:\n\n- Have sex with only one partner who has sex only with you. Ask all potential sex partners about their sexual history and intravenous (IV) drug use before becoming physically intimate.\n- Use a latex condom every time you have vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Use only water-based lubricants. Do not use a condom after its expiration date or if it has been damaged in any way. Never reuse a condom.\n\n- Keep in mind that STDs can be transmitted during sex using sexual aids or body parts other than the penis, such as fingers.\n- Note that although spermicides kill some infectious microorganisms, they are formulated to kill sperm and are meant to be used along with condoms, not as a substitute. In addition, spermicides (including those containing nonoxynol-9) are not effective in preventing STDs, including HIV infection.\n\nAlthough condoms provide effective protection against most STDs, they cannot always completely block contact with the bacteria or viruses that cause STDs. For this reason, always look for any signs of STDs, such as sores on the penis or around the vagina, in your sex partner. Because STDs do not always produce obvious signs, ask your partner directly. If you still have any doubts, don't have sex.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Chlamydia]\nChlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States. It is caused by infection with the bacterium *Chlamydia trachomatis*, which is usually transmitted during vaginal or anal sex and, less frequently, during oral sex. In women, the bacteria can infect the urethra, the uterus and cervix, the fallopian tubes, the anus, and the conjunctiva (the mucous membrane that covers the white of the eye and lines the inside of the eyelids). In men, the bacteria can infect the urethra, the epididymis, the prostate gland, the anus, and the conjunctiva.\n\nIn women, untreated chlamydia can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (see page 871), which can cause infertility. The infection can also cause inflammation of the urethra (nongonococcal urethritis; see page 481) in women. In men, chlamydia is one of the leading causes of urethritis. If not treated, the infection can lead to inflammation of the prostate gland (prostatitis; see ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Looped", "relation": "treats", "tail": "Sexually Transmitted Diseases"}, {"head": "Pinched", "relation": "treats", "tail": "Sexually Transmitted Diseases"}, {"head": "Burned", "relation": "treats", "tail": "Sexually Transmitted Diseases"}, {"head": "Cut", "relation": "treats", "tail": "Sexually Transmitted Diseases"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "OLDER PEOPLE", "relation": "experiences", "tail": "[Event: Looped and banded]"}, {"head": "OLDER PEOPLE", "relation": "experiences", "tail": "[Event: Pinched with clip]"}, {"head": "OLDER PEOPLE", "relation": "experiences", "tail": "[Event: Burned]"}, {"head": "OLDER PEOPLE", "relation": "experiences", "tail": "[Event: Cut and tied]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: Looped and banded]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: Sexually Transmitted Diseases]"}, {"head": "[Event: Pinched with clip]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: Sexually Transmitted Diseases]"}, {"head": "[Event: Burned]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: Sexually Transmitted Diseases]"}, {"head": "[Event: Cut and tied]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: Sexually Transmitted Diseases]"}]}, "status": "success"}

If symptoms develop, it is usually within 1 to 3 weeks after exposure to the bacteria. In men, possible symptoms can include pain during urination, burning or itching around the urethra, a discharge from the penis, or swelling of the testicles. In women, possible symptoms can include pain in the lower abdomen, pain during sexual intercourse, vaginal discharge, and bleeding between menstrual periods. Women are less likely to have symptoms than men, but are more likely to experience long-term complications—such as infertility—as a result of the infection. Also, a pregnant woman who has chlamydia can pass the infection to her baby during delivery, which can cause pneumonia or conjunctivitis in the newborn.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose chlamydia, a doctor uses a swab to obtain a sample of discharge from a man's urethra or a woman's cervix, for examination under a microscope. The doctor probably will order laboratory tests of a sample of urine and samples of cells taken from the penis, cervix, urethra, or anus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTo treat chlamydia, a doctor may prescribe an antibiotic such as azithromycin or doxycycline. Because people with chlamydia may also have an STD called gonorrhea (see next page), doctors frequently prescribe a combination of antibiotics to treat both infections at the same time. In some cases, the antibiotics may be administered intravenously (through a vein) in the hospital. Both you and your partner should be treated to help ensure that the infection is eliminated. Your doctor will ask you to avoid all sexual contact until treatment is completed and you have no symptoms. Ask your doctor when you can safely resume sexual activity.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Trichomoniasis]\nTrichomoniasis is a common sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by Trichomonas vaginalis, a tiny, one-cell parasite. In women, the microorganism infects the vagina. In men, it can infect the urethra, the epididymis, the prostate gland, or the bladder. Five million new cases of trichomoniasis occur each year in women and men in the United States. Because the infection is usually transmitted through intercourse, it is likely that your sex partner also has the infection if you have it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Trichomoniasis > *Symptoms*]\nIn women, trichomoniasis produces a frothy, yellow-green vaginal discharge, often with a strong odor. Itching and irritation may develop in the vaginal area. The infection can also cause discomfort during intercourse or urination. In a pregnant woman, trichomoniasis can cause preterm delivery (see page 529). Although most men with trichomoniasis do not have symptoms, some men may experience irritation inside the urethra, a mild discharge from the penis, or a mild burning sensation after ejaculation or urination. If the infection spreads to the epididymis, it can cause pain in the testicles. Even without symptoms, men with trichomoniasis can infect their sex partner.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Trichomoniasis > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose trichomoniasis in a woman, a doctor will perform a pelvic examination and take a sample of vaginal secretions for laboratory analysis. To diagnose trichomoniasis in a man, a doctor will take a sample of secretions from the urethra for laboratory analysis. The doctor may also order urine tests.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe usual treatment for trichomoniasis is the antibiotic metronidazole, given by mouth in a single dose. Both partners should be treated at the same time to help ensure that the parasite is eliminated. Your doctor will ask you to avoid sexual contact until both you and your partner complete treatment and have no symptoms. Ask your doctor when you can safely resume sexual activity.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > WARNING! > **Do Not Drink Alcohol When Taking Metronidazole**]\nWhen taking metronidazole, do not drink alcohol or take nonprescription medications that contain alcohol (for example, some over-the-counter cold medications). The combination of metronidazole and alcohol can cause serious side effects such as abdominal cramping, flushing, headache, nausea, or vomiting.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > Genital Warts]\nGenital warts are a common and highly contagious sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). More than 5 million people are infected with HPV each year in the United States. There are more than 100 types of HPV, 30 of which can infect the genital area. Some strains of HPV can produce genital warts and cause precancerous changes in cells. Some strains of HPV have been linked to cervical cancer in women and other genital cancers in both men and women.\n\nGenital warts are spread during vaginal, anal, or oral sex and usually develop in warm, moist areas of the body, including the vagina, ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "men", "relation": "are more likely to have symptoms than", "tail": "women"}, {"head": "women", "relation": "are less likely to have symptoms than", "tail": "men"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

In the early stages of the infection, the symptoms are often mild and may go unnoticed. Frequently, women with gonorrhea have no symptoms, but some women develop symptoms about 2 to 8 days after sexual contact with an infected person or at the beginning of their next period. Possible symptoms include a mild fever, burning or pain during urination, cloudy discharge from\n\nthe vagina, discomfort or pain in the lower abdomen, or abnormal bleeding from the vagina. In some cases, a woman with gonorrhea experiences painful urination, inflammation of the bladder (cystitis; see page 877), or vaginal bleeding with sexual intercourse. If gonorrhea has led to pelvic inflammatory disease, symptoms can include abdominal cramps and pain, bleeding between periods, vomiting, or fever.\n\nMen who have gonorrhea often have no symptoms, or they may urinate more often than usual or have severe pain and burning during urination or a cloudy, pus-filled discharge from the penis.\n\nWhen gonorrhea infects the rectum, a person may experience anal itching, a cloudy discharge from the anus, and painful, bloody bowel movements. When gonorrhea infects the throat, most people have no symptoms, but some can have a sore throat.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA diagnosis of gonorrhea is based on the symptoms, a physical examination, the results of blood and urine tests, and laboratory analysis of the discharge. The doctor uses a swab to obtain a sample of discharge from the man's urethra or the woman's cervix for examination under a microscope.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nGonorrhea can be treated with antibiotics such as cefixime (taken orally) or ceftriaxone (injected directly into a muscle). Because people who have gonorrhea often also have an STD called chlamydia (see page 477), doctors usually prescribe a combination of antibiotics to treat both infections at the same time. If gonorrhea has spread through the bloodstream, a doctor will admit the person to a hospital and prescribe intravenous antibiotics.\n\nTo prevent conjunctivitis in a newborn whose mother has gonorrhea, a doctor will apply medication such as silver nitrate to the infant's eyes immediately after delivery. If untreated, gonorrhea in an infant can lead to arthritis (see page 996) or a life-threatening condition called sepsis (bacteria in the blood).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Nongonococcal Urethritis**]\nNongonococcal urethritis (NGU) is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that causes inflammation of the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body). Nongonococcal means that the infection is not caused by the type of bacteria that causes gonorrhea (see page 480). Most cases are caused by the bacterium *Chlamydia trachomatis*.\n\nNGU is usually transmitted through contact with the mucous membranes in the penis, vagina, mouth, or anus of an infected person during sexual activity. Other possible causes of NGU include urinary tract infections (see page 803), inflammation of the prostate gland (bacterial prostatitis; see page 831), narrowing of the urethra (urethral stricture; see page 837), tightening of the foreskin (phimosis; see page 839), and having a urinary catheter (a thin, flexible tube used to drain urine from the bladder).\n\nIn men, untreated NGU can lead to inflammation of the epididymis (epididymitis; see page 827), which can result in infertility (see page 494), arthritis (see page 996), conjunctivitis (see page 1038), and skin lesions. In women, untreated NGU can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (see page 871), which, in turn, can lead to ectopic pregnancy (see page 523), infertility, chronic pelvic pain, chronic inflammation of the urethra (urethritis; see page 878), inflammation of the vagina (vaginitis; see page 879), or, in a pregnant woman, miscarriage (see page 522). In both men and women, untreated NGU resulting from anal sex can cause severe inflammation of the rectum.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nOften, NGU does not produce symptoms, but an infected person can still pass the infection to his or her sex partner. In men, possible symptoms can include a discharge from the penis, pain or burning when urinating, and itching, irritation, and tenderness. In women, possible symptoms include a painful, burning sensation during urination, and a frequent need to urinate that produces only a small amount of urine. Other symptoms in women include abdominal pain, a heavy vaginal discharge, bleeding between periods, or heavy menstrual bleeding. In both men and women, an anal infection can cause rectal itching and a discharge or pain during bowel movements. An oral infection usually does not produce symptoms, but some people can have a sore throat.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA diagnosis of NGU is based on the symptoms, a physical examination, the", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "gonorrhea", "relation": "has symptom", "tail": "mild fever"}, {"head": "gonorrhea", "relation": "has symptom", "tail": "burning or pain during urination"}, {"head": "gonorrhea", "relation": "has symptom", "tail": "cloudy discharge from the vagina"}, {"head": "gonorrhea", "relation": "has symptom", "tail": "discomfort or pain in the lower abdomen"}, {"head": "gonorrhea", "relation": "has symptom", "tail": "abnormal bleeding from the vagina"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "women with gonorrhea", "relation": "develop symptoms", "tail": "[Event: about 2 to 8 days after sexual contact with an infected person]"}, {"head": "women with gonorrhea", "relation": "experience symptoms", "tail": "[Event: at the beginning of their next period]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: early stages of the infection]", "relation": "lead to", "tail": "[Event: possible symptoms include a mild fever, burning or pain during urination, cloudy discharge from the vagina, discomfort or pain in the lower abdomen, or abnormal bleeding from the vagina]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Because people who are infected with the herpes simplex virus have an increased risk of contracting other STDs, doctors may also order tests for other STDs. To confirm the diagnosis, a doctor may order blood tests to check for antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) produced by the immune system to fight the herpes virus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThere is no cure for genital herpes, but your doctor may prescribe an antiviral drug such as acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir, which may speed healing and reduce the\n\nperiod of time during which the disease is most contagious. Your doctor will recommend that you keep the affected area clean and dry during outbreaks, avoid touching the sores, wash your hands thoroughly if you touch the sores, and avoid sexual contact from the moment symptoms begin until the last sore has fully healed. If you have another STD, the doctor will recommend treatment for that infection as well. Ask your doctor when you can safely resume sexual activity.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Syphilis]\nSyphilis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by the bacterium *Treponema pallidum*. The bacteria are transmitted by direct contact with a syphilis sore during vaginal, oral, or anal sex, and the infection spreads throughout the body in the blood and lymphatic vessels. A pregnant woman can transmit the infection to her fetus, potentially causing serious birth defects or stillbirth.\n\nPeople who have syphilis have an increased risk of becoming infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS (see page 909). Syphilis can cause CD4 cells (the infection-fighting white blood cells that are targeted by HIV) to go to the infected area to fight the infection. If HIV is present in the infected area, it will target and infect the CD4 cells, which can then spread HIV throughout the body.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nSyphilis progresses through three distinct stages, each with its own symptoms. If not treated promptly, the infection can persist for years.\n\n- **First stage** In the first stage, called primary syphilis, the disease is confined to one area of the body. From 10 days to 3 months after exposure to the bacteria (but usually within 2 to 6 weeks), a small, painless sore called a chancre develops. A chancre is usually red and solid and protrudes above the skin. The initial chancre usually appears in the genital area, such as on the penis or vulva or inside the vagina, but can also develop on the lips, tongue, cervix, rectum, or other parts of the body. Chancre on the penis are usually visible, but when they develop in a woman's vagina or cervix they are not easily detected. A chancre heals in 1 to 5 weeks, leaving a thin scar. During this stage, the bacteria circulate in the bloodstream.\n\n- **Second stage** During the second stage, called secondary syphilis, the bacteria spread and cause symptoms throughout the body. About 6 weeks after the chancre has healed, you may feel generally ill and have a sore throat, fever, and headache. You may have\n\nswollen glands in your neck, armpits, and groin, and a skin rash of small, red, scaly bumps that do not itch. You may experience patchy hair loss. Spots may appear on the palms of your hands and on the soles of your feet. Gray patches of skin, which are different from chancres, can develop in the mucous membranes of the mouth, vulva, and penis. A rash may also develop around the rectum. These skin conditions, which are highly infectious, usually heal within 2 to 6 weeks.\n\n**Third stage** For several years during the third stage, called tertiary syphilis, a person has no symptoms. Then, without warning, the disease flares up, producing a variety of symptoms depending on the part of the body that has been infected. For example, if the infection has spread to the brain and nervous system, it can cause paralysis, dementia, loss of equilibrium, loss of sensation in the legs, and, rarely, blindness. If the aorta (the main artery in the body) is infected, its walls may weaken and balloon out, forming an aneurysm (see page 599). The infection can interfere with the functioning of the aortic valve, causing inflammation of the aorta or aortic insufficiency (see page 593). During this stage, syphilis can also affect the liver, the stomach, the eyes, and other organs and tissues throughout the body.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of syphilis is based on the symptoms, a physical examination, and the results of blood tests. A doctor may remove a sample of tissue from a sore for examination under a microscope, to look for the syphilis bacteria. If the doctor suspects damage to the brain and nervous system, he or she may test a sample of cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nSyphilis is easy to treat in the first stage (and ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "acyclovir", "relation": "prescribes", "tail": "genital herpes"}, {"head": "famciclovir", "relation": "prescribes", "tail": "genital herpes"}, {"head": "valacyclovir", "relation": "prescribes", "tail": "genital herpes"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "orders", "tail": "[Event: blood tests]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "orders", "tail": "[Event: laboratory tests]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "prescribes", "tail": "[Event: treatment with antiviral drug]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: infection with herpes simplex virus]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: diagnosis of genital herpes]"}, {"head": "[Event: diagnosis of genital herpes]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment with antiviral drug]"}]}, "status": "success"}

These problems can be caused by or made worse by such factors as a lack of sexual knowledge and experience, inhibition, fatigue, interpersonal conflict, boredom, dissatisfaction with the appearance of your body, performance anxiety, guilt, or previous sexual abuse or assault. Sexual problems also can signal the presence of an underlying medical condition, such as diabetes. Sometimes physical problems such as an infection or inflammation can produce symptoms that prevent you from enjoying sex. Once diagnosed and treated by a doctor, these problems often disappear.\n\nThe symptoms of most sexual problems can be reversed with increased knowledge about sex and your own sexuality or simple techniques you can learn in sex therapy. The most common sexual problems in men include erection problems and premature ejaculation. In women, the most common sexual problems are the inability to achieve orgasm, lack of arousal or desire (which can also affect men), painful sex (medically known as dyspareunia), and vaginismus (involuntary spasms of the vagina). Differences in the level of sexual desire is a problem that can affect both men and women in a relationship when one partner wants to have sex more often than the other.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Erection Problems]\nAn erection problem (which doctors call erectile dysfunction) refers to the inability to achieve and maintain an erection adequate for sexual intercourse. Erection problems are the most common sexual problem seen by doctors. Most men experience erection problems at some time in their life, but for 30 million American men (about 10 percent of the entire male population and 35 percent of men over age 60), erection problems are a chronic, recurring condition. Most erection problems are treatable and, with increased awareness of the problem, more men are seeking and responding to treatment.\n\nMost erection problems are caused by physical factors. The ability to achieve and maintain an adequate erection depends on a combination of healthy nerves, blood vessels, muscles, and fibrous tissues, as well as on adequate levels of hormones such as testosterone. Damage, injury, or malfunction in any of these areas can interfere with the ability to achieve or maintain an erection.\n\nInflammation or infection of the prostate gland or bladder can make urination, erection, or ejaculation painful and difficult. In uncircumcised men, neglecting to clean under the foreskin increases the risk of an infection. The foreskin can become so tight over the swollen tip of the inflamed penis that it cannot be drawn back (phimosis; see page 839). Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs; see page 477) such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, or herpes also can affect a man's ability to have an erection.\n\nMedical conditions that damage nerves and blood vessels—such as diabetes (see page 889), heart disease (see page 558), brain or spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis (see page 696), or Parkinson's disease (see page 691)—can cause erection problems. In some cases, prescription medications—such as drugs used to treat high blood pressure and heart disease, and drugs that affect the nervous system such as antidepressants, tranquilizers, and sedatives—contribute to erection problems. Cigarette smoking, over-the-counter medications, alcohol, or illicit drugs such as marijuana, heroin, and cocaine also can play a role. Peyronie's disease (see page 839), a condition in which scarring of the penile tissues produces a curvature of the penis and pain during an erection, is another possible cause. Smoking adversely affects blood flow and can affect a man's ability to have an erection.\n\nIn some men, psychological factors such as anger, stress, anxiety, or depression can contribute to erection problems. Being unable to maintain an erection can make a man feel inadequate, embarrassed, or guilty, and consider himself unattractive to his partner. These feelings may cause him to avoid intimate situations or withdraw from his partner,\n\nwhich can increase tension in the relationship. The psychological effects of erection problems can also affect other areas of his life, such as social interactions and job performance.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nMen who have erection problems may be unable to achieve an erection, may be able to achieve an erection only occasionally, or may be unable to maintain an erection. If you have symptoms of erection problems, your doctor may refer you to a urologist (a doctor who specializes in treating disorders of the urinary tract).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo help diagnose erection problems, a doctor will take a detailed health history and a sexual history. He or she will ask about your ability to achieve and maintain erections and ask you when and how often they occur.

The drug relaxes the smooth muscle and widens the main artery that supplies blood to the penis, increasing blood flow to the penis. The injections are relatively painless and produce an erection that begins about 5 to 15 minutes after the injection and lasts from 30 minutes to 2 hours. No foreplay is needed to produce an erection.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Q & A > Medications for Erection Problems]\n**Q. Can sildenafil or another medication improve my sex life?**\n\n**A. Yes and no.** These drugs are prescription medications used for treating the inability to achieve and maintain an erection adequate for sexual intercourse. If you can achieve an erection through sexual stimulation but cannot maintain it, these drugs can help you. Keep in mind, however, that they are not aphrodisiacs, do not arouse or increase sexual desire, and are not substitutes for working on a relationship. Nor do they improve or prolong erections in men who have normal erections.\n\n**Q. How do I obtain one of these drugs?**\n\n**A. These medications are available only by prescription.** See your doctor if you have an erection problem. The doctor will give you a thorough examination to diagnose your sexual problem to determine if medication would be helpful. Some Web sites offer prescriptions for these drugs without obtaining sufficient medical information from the person.\n\n**Q. I have heart disease and, several months ago, my doctor prescribed nitroglycerin for my chest pain. I use it every day to prevent chest pain. Lately I've been having some problems getting erections. I've heard that medication could help with this problem. Should I ask my doctor for a prescription?**\n\n**A. No.** You cannot safely use sildenafil, vardenafil, or tadalafil for your erection problem if you are taking heart medications such as nitroglycerin or alpha blockers. The combination can cause dangerously low blood pressure. Make sure your doctor knows about all medications you are taking.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Q & A > Urethral suppositories]\nUrethral suppositories are sometimes recommended for treating erection problems. A urethral suppository is a single-use applicator filled with the drug alprostadil, a vasodilator that causes an erection by relaxing the smooth muscle of the penis and widening the main artery that supplies blood to the penis. To use a urethral suppository, insert the applicator about an inch into the urethral opening of the penis. The drug is\n\nreleased, absorbed by the urethra, and transported to the surrounding tissues. An erection begins within 8 to 10 minutes and may last as long as 30 to 60 minutes.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Q & A > Vacuum devices]\nVacuum devices produce erections by pulling blood into the penis and trapping it. You insert your penis into a hollow plastic tube that is closed at one end and press the tube against your body to form a seal. A vacuum is created in the tube with a small hand-or battery-driven pump, drawing blood into the penis and causing the penis to engorge, enlarge, and become rigid. After 1 to 3 minutes in the vacuum, an adequate erection develops and you place a soft rubber O-ring around the base of the penis to trap blood and maintain the erection until you remove the O-ring after sex. The O-ring should be left in place for no more than 30 minutes, or the blood supply to the penis could be blocked.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Q & A > Penile implants]\nAn implantable penile prosthesis (artificial device) is another treatment option for erection problems. All penile implants place prosthetic tubes inside the penis to produce engorgement similar to that of a natural erection. Most implants are inflatable and are flaccid when not in use. These devices are very effective for treating all types of erection problems but, because they are mechanical, they can occasionally malfunction.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Q & A > Penile implant]\nThe inflatable penile implant is a device that is surgically implanted in the penis, scrotum, and lower abdomen. The implant contains cylinders that fill with fluid in the penis to mimic the natural engorgement process that occurs during an erection. The cylinders are attached to a pump that is activated by squeezing the scrotum.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the mechanism of an inflatable penile implant. The left side shows the implant components: a liquid-filled pouch implanted under abdominal muscles, and a pump inside the scrotum.

He or she will perform a physical examination and will probably order a variety of tests to rule out a physical cause of your problem.\n\nTreatment of an inability to achieve orgasm depends on the underlying cause. If your doctor cannot identify an underlying physical condition, he or she may be able to suggest ways to help you achieve orgasm or may refer you to a sex therapist for treatment. Sex therapy usually requires both partners to participate in therapy sessions and perform recommended exercises at home.\n\nThe most successful treatment prescribed by sex therapists for anorgasmia is sexual self-exploration through masturbation, combined with sexual fantasy. Masturbation is a normal, healthy activity that can help a woman learn how to become aroused and find the kind of sexual stimulation she needs to reach orgasm. Then she can use self-stimulation to reach orgasm when she is with her partner, showing her partner the techniques that work best.\n\nSometimes trying a new position during intercourse can help. If your partner is willing, experiment with some new positions. Many women find it easier to attain orgasm when they are on top, astride their partner. In this position, a woman can control the intensity and exact location of her clitoral and vaginal stimulation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment* > **Painful Intercourse**]\nPain during sexual intercourse, also called dyspareunia, can affect both men and women and is usually caused by a physical condition. In women, causes of frictional pain at the vaginal opening include inadequate vaginal lubrication, a vaginal or bladder infection, a sexually transmitted disease (STD) such as genital herpes (see page 482), or soreness after childbirth. Deep pelvic pain can result from conditions such as endometriosis (see page 870), a disorder of the ovaries, or allergic reactions. Chronic pain in the lower back also can cause deep pelvic pain during intercourse.\n\nCommon causes of painful intercourse in men include a tight foreskin, an STD, infection of the prostate gland or bladder, an anatomical abnormality of the penis, or inflammation. Cancer of the penis or testicles and musculoskeletal conditions such as arthritis in the lower back also make thrusting uncomfortable. Some spermicides (see page 471) can cause a burning sensation in both men and women.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment* > *Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment*]\nIn women, symptoms of dyspareunia include pain or discomfort in the external part of the genitals or deep inside the pelvic area. Men usually experience pain in the penis.\n\nYour doctor will be able to find the cause of your discomfort by performing a physical examination of your reproductive organs and ordering tests to detect an infection or an underlying medical condition. Treatment of dyspareunia depends on the underlying cause.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Lack of Interest in Sex]\nA lack of interest in sex is the second most common sexual problem (after erection problems) and affects both men and women. The problem can involve both a lack of desire for one's partner and the inability to become sexually aroused during sexual activity. Fatigue and stress are common causes of lack of interest in sex. Physical causes include a hormonal imbalance, infection, anemia, genital pain, or a long-term illness such as cancer or heart disease. Disinterest in sex sometimes masks another sexual problem, such as premature ejaculation (see previous page) or a woman's inability to have an orgasm (see previous page). After the birth of a baby, some women feel a lack of desire for sex. Pain and bleeding from a recent delivery, sleep deprivation, postpartum depression (see page 540), and fear of another pregnancy can contribute to a decreased desire for sexual activity at this time. Other causes of decreased desire in both men and women include:\n\n- Anxiety after a traumatic life event, such as death of a family member, financial problems, or losing a job\n- Anger\n- Depression\n- A traumatic sexual experience in childhood\n- Use of alcohol or other drugs such as narcotics or tranquilizers\n\nThe male sex hormone testosterone stimulates the male sex drive. If your testosterone levels are low, your sexual interest and capacity for arousal are also likely to be low. The condition underlying a drop in testosterone level may be physical, such as liver, kidney, or pituitary disease, or it may be a side effect of a drug you are taking. Other sexual disorders, such as erection problems (see page 486), can interfere with the enjoyment of intercourse and cause a man to lose interest in sex or avoid sex.\n\nIn some cases, poor communication causes a woman to receive less than adequate sexual stimulation from her partner.

This condition prevents intercourse because the muscles around the opening of the vagina tighten so much that the penis cannot penetrate. Women who have vaginismus may not even be able to insert a tampon into their vagina. The inability to reach orgasm (see page 489) often accompanies this disorder.\n\nVaginismus is an exaggeration of a natural protective vaginal reflex, similar to the action of closing your eyes in a dust storm. The most common causes of vaginismus are emotional factors such as shame, guilt, or anxiety over a possible pregnancy, or the anticipation of painful intercourse. Inadequate education or misinformation about sexuality can produce fear that results in the disorder.\n\nTemporary vaginismus sometimes occurs when a woman has a physical problem that affects the genitals, such as an abscess or severe inflammation of the vagina. Any traumatic sexual experience, such as rape or sexual abuse, can cause temporary or permanent vaginismus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nYour doctor can diagnose vaginismus from your description of the symptoms and an examination of your genital area. If the doctor suspects a physical cause, he or she will order any tests necessary to diagnose it. If no physical cause is detected, the doctor probably will refer you to a sex therapist for treatment. The therapist will work with you to find the underlying cause of the problem and help you overcome it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Infertility]\nInfertility is a medical condition that impairs a person's ability to have children. Doctors diagnose infertility when a couple has failed to achieve a pregnancy after having unprotected intercourse for several months. Doctors also consider women infertile who have become pregnant but have not been able to have a live birth because of repeated miscarriages or stillbirths. Infertility affects more than 6 million people nationwide, occurring in both men and women.\n\nCoping with infertility can be a difficult, life-changing process that produces strong feelings of loss and disappointment. Both women and men may feel helpless, angry, or guilty; men may feel that it diminishes their masculinity and women their femininity. Couples who undergo treatment for infertility often experience hope followed by disappointment.\n\nDiagnostic techniques, innovative drugs, and surgical procedures are available to help many infertile couples. Most cases of infertility are treated with medication or surgery. However, about 5 percent of cases require more sophisticated assisted reproductive techniques, such as in vitro fertilization.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Causes of Infertility]\nInfertility is a problem usually experienced as a couple. There are many causes of infertility, and a couple can have more than one medical condition that affects their fertility. About 40 to 50 percent of cases of infertility result from a difficulty with the woman's reproductive system and about 30 to 40 percent from a difficulty with the man's. In approximately 10 to 30 percent of couples, infertility results from either factors related to both the man and the woman or is considered unexplained. Many causes of infertility are reversible with treatment, but some are not. If the cause of infertility cannot be corrected, techniques exist that can bypass it and result in a pregnancy. However, there are no guarantees of success from infertility treatment and, in spite of repeated attempts, some couples never conceive.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Causes of Infertility in Women*]\nThe causes of infertility in women are numerous and range from a deficiency of eggs, to infection that causes obstructive scarring in the reproductive system, to medical conditions such as diabetes or thyroid disorders that alter metabolism. The most common causes of infertility in women are:\n\n- **Lack of ovulation** Failure to ovulate (release an egg from the ovary during the menstrual cycle) is usually caused by a hormonal imbalance.\n- **Polycystic ovarian syndrome** Polycystic ovarian syndrome (see page 865), a metabolic disorder characterized by abnormal hormone levels, affects up to 10 percent of all women. An imbalance of the ovulation-stimulating hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) blocks ovulation.\n- **Infection** Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs; see page 477) or peritonitis (inflammation of the membrane lining the wall of the abdominal cavity) can cause scarring and blockage of the fallopian tubes.\n- **Endometriosis** The growth of uterine tissue in the pelvis can either block an egg's passage from the ovary through a fallopian tube or form ovarian cysts.\n- **Pelvic surgery** Surgery in the pelvic area can result in adhesions (bands of fibrous scar tissue) that obstruct or misshape a woman's reproductive organs, preventing an egg from reaching a fallopian t", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "vaginismus", "relation": "is caused by", "tail": "emotional factors"}, {"head": "vaginismus", "relation": "is similar to", "tail": "natural protective vaginal reflex"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

If you are trying to conceive, keep the following in mind:\n\n- **Delayed childbearing** A woman's fertility starts to decline after about age 30. Advancing maternal age coupled with a medical cause of infertility significantly increases a woman's risk of infertility.\n- **Smoking** Cigarette smoking decreases the amount of estrogen a woman's ovaries produce for ovulation and increases the risk of genetic abnormalities in her eggs. Smoking also increases the risk of miscarriage and can bring on early menopause. In men, smoking seems to increase the production of abnormally shaped or genetically altered sperm.\n- **Weight problems** Overweight women produce excessive amounts of estrogen and underweight women produce too little estrogen, both of which can disrupt ovulation. Obese women have an increased risk of miscarriage,\n\nwhich can result from a hormonal imbalance. Obese men can become infertile when layers of fat increase the temperature around the testicles, producing a low sperm count.\n\n- **Alcohol consumption** Having even one alcoholic drink per week can lower a woman's chances of conceiving by about 7 percent. Excessive drinking (consuming more than two drinks a day) lowers a man's sperm count. The more you drink, the lower your chances of conceiving.\n\n- **Sexually transmitted diseases** STDs such as chlamydia can cause scarring of the fallopian tubes, blocking them and preventing eggs from traveling to the uterus.\n\n- **Caffeine** Consuming more than two caffeine-containing beverages per day may decrease fertility.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Lifestyle Factors That Affect Fertility > Age and success rates for assisted reproductive technologies]\nA woman's age has the biggest influence on the success of an assisted reproductive technology using the woman's own eggs. The success rates are defined by pregnancies and live births. The success rates are highest for women in their 20s and start to decline after about age 30, reflecting the normal gradual decline in a woman's fertility with age. The chart above is based on 1999 figures from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n![Line graph showing the success rates of assisted reproductive technology (ART) for women aged 24 to 46. The Y-axis represents 'Pregnancies and Live Births (%)' (0 to 50). The X-axis represents 'Women's Age' (24 to 46). The graph compares the 'Pregnancy rate' (black line with squares) and the 'Live birth rate' (gray line with circles). Both rates peak around age 28-30, with the pregnancy rate slightly higher than the live birth rate. Both rates decline sharply after age 30, with the pregnancy rate dropping to near zero by age 46, while the live birth rate remains significantly above zero.]()![](_page_897_Figure_6.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosing Infertility]\nDuring the time you are trying to conceive, keep track of the length of your menstrual cycles for a few months and use a home ovulation-predictor kit to predict when you ovulate. Recording this information in a log will help you determine the best time to have intercourse, and the information can help your doctor later if you seek help trying to conceive. In the past, many doctors told their patients to try to conceive for 12 months before seeking medical help, but because many women are waiting until they are older to have a baby, this may be too long.\n\nIf you have not conceived after 6 months of trying, you and your partner should see your doctor, especially if you are over age 30, have a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID; see page 871), or have irregular periods. Your doctor will take a complete medical history from both you and your partner, including asking questions about the frequency and timing of your sexual intercourse. He or she may order some initial infertility tests. Depending on the findings of these tests, your doctor may then refer you to a reproductive endocrinologist (a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating fertility problems).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosing Infertility > *Infertility Testing in Women*]\nInfertility testing is usually much more extensive for women than for men. The initial tests will determine if you are ovulating and can evaluate the quality of your eggs. At your first appointment with the infertility specialist, he or she can test your baseline levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estrogen. FSH stimulates the growth of follicles (fluid-filled sacs that contain the developing eggs) in the ovaries. If you have an ovulation problem, measuring the level of luteinizing hormone (LH) also can be helpful. LH stimulates the follicles to release an egg and causes the lining of the uterus to thicken in preparation for", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "smoking", "relation": "decreases", "tail": "estrogen"}, {"head": "smoking", "relation": "increases", "tail": "risk of genetic abnormalities"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

He or she will ask about your current health and lifestyle to determine if excessive smoking, drinking, or other drug use could be affecting your sperm. The doctor will then perform a thorough physical examination, including an examination of the hair growth in your genital area to determine if you are producing a sufficient amount of testosterone, and an examination of your penis, scrotum, and prostate (to look for abnormalities).\n\nThe semen analysis is the most important test for male fertility. The doctor will ask for at least one semen sample, obtained by masturbation. Before producing a sample, you will have to wait at least 48 hours (but not more than 5 days) after your last ejaculation. Among the factors the doctor will consider when evaluating your semen sample are the appearance and consistency of the semen, the total sperm count, the shape and structure of the sperm, and the motility (movement) and speed of the sperm. If any of these factors fall outside the normal range, the doctor will probably order a second sperm analysis for confirmation and a hormone evaluation to screen for more specific abnormalities.\n\nIn a small number of couples with otherwise unexplained infertility, doctors sometimes order specialized tests, such as a sperm penetration assay, which measures the sperm's ability to penetrate an egg by pairing the sperm with the egg from a hamster using *in vitro* fertilization (see page 500). Infertile men who have very low or absent sperm counts may undergo genetic testing to determine if they have a chromosome abnormality (see page 955). The results of the initial tests determine what other tests you will need.\n\nIf the results of your semen analysis are abnormal, the infertility specialist will probably refer you to a urologist (a doctor who specializes in treating disorders of the male urinary and reproductive system) who is trained in male infertility for a more extensive evaluation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Infertility Testing in Men* > **How to Choose an Infertility Treatment Center**]\nSelecting an infertility treatment center can be confusing because different centers provide different services and produce varying success rates. When\n\nyou are searching for infertility treatment, ask whether the centers you have selected offer the following basic services:\n\n- **Seven-day availability** The center's staff and services should be available every day of the week, on weekends, and on holidays so you can call with information about your menstrual cycle and find out your test results quickly.\n- **Psychological support** The center should have mental health professionals available to provide support during this difficult time.\n- **On-site laboratory** The clinic should be able to perform semen analysis, postcoital tests, and blood and hormone tests on site to save critical time. The laboratory should be fully certified.\n- **Ultrasound equipment** Transvaginal ultrasound monitoring, in which an ultrasound scan of your ovaries is performed through the vagina, helps to determine if the prescribed medication is stimulating ovulation and if your ovaries are releasing eggs.\n\nAsk whether the doctors who will be caring for you are board-certified in reproductive endocrinology, how many live births have occurred in their program, and what the costs will be. Insurance coverage for infertility treatment varies by state and type of health insurance. Check with your employer to find out exactly what kind of coverage you have.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects and reports the success rates of all assisted reproductive technology programs in the country that belong to the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies. You can access this information on the Internet at <http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphe/drh/art.htm>. To obtain a printed copy, call the CDC's division of reproductive health at 770-488-5372.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Infertility Testing in Men* > *Unexplained Infertility*]\nAbout 10 to 30 percent of all infertile couples are told that their infertility cannot be explained. Doctors reach a diagnosis of unexplained infertility after ruling out other possible causes through a standard battery of tests. The diagnosis does not mean that no cause for the infertility exists, but rather that the cause cannot be identified using the initial screening tests.\n\nAfter 1 to 3 years of unexplained infertility, many couples conceive on their own. The age of the woman is usually the key in this process. Spontaneous conception is much more likely in a woman under age 35 than in a woman who is over 40.

For example, if your sperm count has been lowered by an infection or a medical condition, your doctor will provide appropriate treatment. The doctor also will strongly recommend that you discontinue any activities—including excessive smoking, drinking, or other drug use—that might be contributing to your infertility. In general, a healthy lifestyle promotes good sperm production.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Tubal cannulation > *Treating Infertility in Men* > **Surgery**]\nIf infertility is the result of a blockage in the vas deferens (one of the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the urethra), surgeons can sometimes open the blockage. Doctors can correct a varicose vein in a testicle (varicocele; see page 829), which can lower sperm production, by performing surgery to tie off the affected vein.\n\nAn outpatient procedure called percutaneous embolization is as effective as traditional surgery in correcting a varicocele without the need for general anesthesia and has fewer complications. During percutaneous embolization, the surgeon inserts a small tube into a vein in the groin area through a tiny incision. He or she then injects a dye into the vein and, guided by X-ray imaging, inserts tiny metal coils or a balloon into the vein to block the flow of blood, which shrinks the varicose vein. Recovery takes less than 24 hours. Treating a varicocele improves sperm production and increases the chances of conception.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Tubal cannulation > *Treating Infertility in Men* > **Medications**]\nA low sperm count or poor sperm motility (movement) can sometimes result if a man's testicles are not being stimulated enough naturally by the hormones FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone). In this case, a doctor may recommend taking the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) for several months to improve sperm production and motility.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Tubal cannulation > *Assisted Reproductive Technologies*]\nIf treatment with medication or surgery has not helped you and your partner conceive, you may want to consider additional infertility techniques known collectively as assisted reproductive technologies. These techniques use high-tech methods to fertilize an egg and transfer it to a woman's uterus. This technology, which has helped many couples achieve a pregnancy, has improved steadily over the past several years, and the success rate may soon be approaching 50 percent for each attempt.\n\nAssisted reproductive techniques such as in vitro fertilization (see right) are the most stressful of all infertility treatments. The woman must give herself frequent injections of drugs and have blood tests and ultrasound scans regularly. Both partners usually approach each attempt with hope and can be disappointed if the procedure fails. Feelings of depression, frustration, and hopelessness are common after a failed in vitro fertilization. Then the process starts over again the next month, and may be repeated several times. Before undergoing assisted reproductive techniques, educate yourself about them thoroughly, ask for support from your family and friends, and take good care of yourself by getting enough rest and exercise and by eating well. It can be helpful to talk to a mental health professional who has been recommended by your infertility clinic.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Tubal cannulation > *Assisted Reproductive Technologies* > **Intrauterine insemination**]\nIn intrauterine insemination, often called artificial insemination, a doctor uses a thin tube (catheter) and syringe to introduce sperm from the woman's partner (or from a donor) directly into the uterus, close to the time of ovulation. Intrauterine insemination is designed to make it easier for sperm to reach the fallopian tubes to fertilize an egg. It is used when the man's sperm count is only marginally low or when the woman's cervical mucus prevents sperm from entering the uterus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Tubal cannulation > **Donor Sperm**]\nCouples sometimes choose to use donated sperm if the man cannot produce enough normal sperm to fertilize his partner'", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Tubal cannulation", "relation": "treats", "tail": "blocked fallopian tube"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "wire", "relation": "threaded through", "tail": "[Event: procedure to open a blocked fallopian tube]"}, {"head": "hysteroscope", "relation": "inserted through", "tail": "[Event: procedure to open a blocked fallopian tube]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

An increasing number of couples are choosing to donate their embryos to another infertile couple. Embryo donation is an option for the same reasons as egg donation. In addition, it may be used by single women whose own eggs would not otherwise be used or by couples in which both the male and female are infertile and who choose not to (or cannot afford to) undergo a complete cycle of IVF.\n\nThe process is similar to the final step of IVF, in which embryos are introduced into the woman's uterus to produce a pregnancy. Before undergoing the procedure, the woman who is receiving the donated embryos will have a thorough physical examination and tests to make sure that a pregnancy would not compromise her health. She will be given hormones, including estrogen and progesterone, to prepare the lining of her uterus to accept an embryo. In some cases, the timing of implantation is based on the woman's own menstrual cycle. When the uterus is ready, the frozen embryos are thawed and transferred to the uterus. If pregnancy results, the woman continues to take the estrogen and progesterone for 8 weeks.\n\nIf you are considering embryo donation (either as a donor or as a recipient), talk to a mental health professional and a lawyer about the ethical and legal issues concerning the procedure.

In these cases, some infertile couples ask another woman to serve as a gestational carrier—also known as a surrogate mother. This agreement is a legal contract in which the woman consents to have a fertilized egg from the couple implanted into her uterus and to carry the pregnancy to term. The woman further agrees to turn the baby over to the couple upon delivery.\n\nHaving a baby with a gestational carrier has a number of medical and legal consequences, so be sure to discuss the topic thoroughly with both your doctor and an attorney before going ahead with it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pregnancy and Childbirth]\nA healthy pregnancy starts before a woman gets pregnant. If you are planning to get pregnant, make an appointment with your doctor. He or she will perform a thorough examination to evaluate your health and determine if you have any medical conditions or inherited disorders that could complicate a pregnancy or make it inadvisable for you to get pregnant. In addition, if you have a chronic disorder—such as a heart disorder (see page 520), epilepsy (see page 686), diabetes (see page 889), kidney disease, or an autoimmune disease such as lupus (see page 920) or rheumatoid arthritis (see page 918)—your condition must be carefully monitored throughout your pregnancy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pregnancy and Childbirth > Pregnancy]\nThe healthier you are during your pregnancy, the more likely your child will be born healthy. If you are trying to become pregnant, take steps now to help ensure a healthy pregnancy. Stop smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol, avoid potentially harmful drugs or chemicals, eat healthfully (lots of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes), and exercise regularly. Taking 400 micrograms (0.4 milligram) of folic acid every day in a supplement will reduce your risk of having a child with abnormal development of the spine or brain (neural tube defect; see page 398). Depending on your health history, higher doses of folic acid may be recommended.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pregnancy and Childbirth > Conception]\nConception begins with the fertilization of one of a woman's eggs. Fertilization can occur shortly after a mature egg is released from an ovary, which usually occurs about halfway through the menstrual cycle. If a woman has sexual intercourse during this time,\n\nshe can get pregnant as sperm ejaculated from her male partner travel through her vagina and uterus up to the fallopian tubes. Fertilization occurs if a sperm penetrates the cell wall of an egg inside one of the fallopian tubes. The fertilized egg reaches the uterus 2 to 7 days later and embeds itself in the lining of the uterus, at about the time a woman's period is due. By the time most women suspect they may be pregnant, the egg has become an embryo that is developing inside the uterus.\n\nA full-term pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks from the time of conception to delivery. Although conception usually occurs halfway through a woman's menstrual cycle, the delivery date is calculated from the first day of her last period because the exact day the egg is fertilized is difficult to know.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Confirming a Pregnancy]\nIf you have missed a menstrual period and want to know if you are pregnant, you can use a home pregnancy test. Home pregnancy tests work by detecting the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), which is present in the urine of a pregnant woman about 2 weeks after her first missed period. The results are most accurate when you follow the manufacturer's instructions exactly and test your urine first thing in the morning before you drink anything. The results of a home pregnancy test may not be reliable if you are taking antidepressants (see page 712), are approaching menopause, or have irregular or infrequent periods. Also, a negative result (indicating you are not pregnant) is less reliable than a positive result (indicating you are pregnant). You should see your doctor if you have a negative result on a home test but still suspect that you are pregnant. Your doctor, a family planning clinic, or your local health department can perform a more accurate pregnancy test.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Eggs, sperm, and fertilization]\nA woman's ovaries, one on each side of her uterus, contain thousands of immature eggs, with which she was born. After puberty, one of the eggs matures each month in one of the ovaries and, about halfway through the menstrual cycle, it is released into the adjacent fallopian tube. In males, sperm are produced continuously inside the testicles and are stored in the seminal vesicles until ejaculation.\n\nFertilization of an egg by a sperm takes place in one of the fallopian tubes shortly after the egg is released into the fallopian ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "hysterectomy", "relation": "causes", "tail": "infertility"}, {"head": "multiple miscarriages", "relation": "causes", "tail": "infertility"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "woman", "relation": "consents to", "tail": "[Event: have a fertilized egg implanted]"}, {"head": "woman", "relation": "agrees to", "tail": "[Event: carry the pregnancy to term]"}, {"head": "woman", "relation": "agrees to", "tail": "[Event: turn the baby over to the couple upon delivery]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: having a hysterectomy]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: infertility]"}, {"head": "[Event: multiple miscarriages]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: infertility]"}, {"head": "[Event: gestational carrier agreement]", "relation": "results in", "tail": "[Event: pregnancy]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Besides regular checkups with your doctor to monitor the progress of your pregnancy and to receive information about how to have a healthy pregnancy, prenatal care may involve tests to detect genetic diseases or birth defects in the fetus such as congenital heart disease (see page 389), neural tube defects (see page 398), or chromosome abnormalities such as Down syndrome (see page 955). A woman and her partner may also want to sign up for childbirth preparation classes to prepare themselves for labor and delivery.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Prenatal Care > Regular Prenatal Checkups]\nOnce your pregnancy has been confirmed, your doctor may refer you to an obstetrician (a doctor who specializes in the care of a woman during pregnancy, labor, delivery, and the period immediately after delivery), or schedule you for subsequent checkups and tests. Prenatal checkups are usually scheduled monthly until the third trimester, when they are scheduled more frequently.\n\nPrenatal care helps prevent complications of pregnancy and childbirth and provides both the pregnant woman and the fetus with any necessary medical care before birth. Because fetal development is affected by environmental factors inside the uterus and by the woman's state of health (especially during the crucial first 3 months), a woman's doctor may make some lifestyle recommendations. For example, doctors usually recommend that pregnant women not smoke cigarettes (smoking increases the risk of having a baby with a low birth weight or of having a preterm delivery) and avoid alcohol because it can cause a number of serious problems in the fetus, including mental retardation (fetal alcohol syndrome; see page 409). Also avoid taking any unnecessary drugs or exposing yourself to radiation or environmental substances such as lead, mercury, pesticides, or solvents, which can cause complications during pregnancy and delivery. Stay away from saunas, steam baths, hot tubs, and extremely hot baths, which can raise your body temperature to a level that could be harmful to the fetus.\n\nAt your first visit, your doctor will perform a physical examination (including measuring your blood pressure and weight) and establish your due date (which usually is set 40 weeks from the first day of your last menstrual period, but may be adjusted based on the size of the fetus shown on an ultrasound or the size of your uterus felt on a pelvic examination). The doctor will examine your cervix to make sure it can support a\n\npregnancy. He or she will take your medical history and ask if there is a possibility that you could have a sexually transmitted disease (all pregnant women are tested for gonorrhea and syphilis).\n\nAt your initial visit or during subsequent visits, you will have blood tests for blood type (see page 145), Rh factor (see next page), and anemia (see page 610); for infections (see next page) such as rubella, hepatitis B (see page 786), and toxoplasmosis; and for excess levels of protein (which can indicate preeclampsia; see page 526) and glucose (a sign of gestational diabetes; see page 521).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Smoking and Pregnancy]\nSmoking is especially harmful during pregnancy. Seriously consider quitting if you are pregnant because:\n\n- Smoking increases your risk of having an ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage.\n- Smoking doubles your risk of having serious pregnancy complications involving the placenta.\n- Smoking makes you twice as likely as a nonsmoking woman to have a baby with a low birth weight, and more likely to have a preterm delivery.\n- Smoking may increase your baby's risk of having birth defects such as clubfoot, cleft lip, or cleft palate.\n- Smoking triples your baby's risk of dying of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) compared with children of mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy.\n- Smoking increases your child's risk of having an attention deficit disorder or learning disability.\n\nAsk your doctor about a quit-smoking strategy (see page 29) that would be safe and effective for you.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Infectious Diseases and Pregnancy*]\nSome infections that a woman develops during pregnancy can cause birth defects or can be fatal to the fetus.

Other tests, such as ultrasound, can evaluate the development of the fetus, detect any structural abnormalities, and date the pregnancy. For various reasons, pregnant women may choose not to have the tests. For example, some women would never consider terminating a pregnancy even if a severe or lethal defect were found in the fetus. During your pregnancy, discuss your feelings with your doctor, who can help you evaluate the benefits and risks of having the tests.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Prenatal Testing > *Ultrasound*]\nUltrasound (see page 111) is an imaging procedure that uses sound waves to produce pictures of the developing fetus on a monitor. Ultrasound does not involve radiation or X-rays and is harmless, painless, and noninvasive. Ultrasound is offered to most women at least once during their pregnancy and more frequently to women who may be at risk of having problems. During the first trimester, ultrasound is often used to confirm and date a pregnancy by determining the size and shape of the fetus. Many doctors recommend an ultrasound between the 17th and 19th weeks of pregnancy to evaluate fetal growth and development and to rule out some structural abnormalities such as neural tube defects (see page 398) or cleft lip or cleft palate (see page 403). Ultrasound can also detect twins and, after the 16th week, can sometimes determine a fetus's gender. During late pregnancy, ultrasound may be used to evaluate the health, size, and position of the fetus and the placenta in preparation for delivery.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Prenatal Testing > Rh Disease in Pregnancy]\nWhen a woman with Rh-negative blood has a fetus with Rh-positive blood, some of the fetus's blood may enter the woman's bloodstream at birth, or during pregnancy. If the woman is not given Rh immunoglobulin within 72 hours of delivery, her immune system will develop antibodies to fight the Rh-\n\npositive blood, which it recognizes as foreign. These antibodies don't cause problems in a first Rh-incompatible pregnancy, but if the woman does not receive the Rh immunoglobulin and has a subsequent Rh-positive fetus, her antibodies could cross the placenta and destroy the fetus's red blood cells, possibly causing anemia or even death. After a miscarriage or the termination of a pregnancy, Rh immunoglobulin should always be administered to an Rh-negative woman.\n\nKey\n\n- Rh-negative blood\n- Rh-positive blood\n- Antibody\n\nDiagram illustrating the progression of Rh incompatibility:\n\n1.

The sound waves are electronically translated into an image on a computer screen.\n\n![Diagram illustrating a vaginal ultrasound procedure. A transducer is inserted into the vagina, and the resulting image of the fetus is displayed on a monitor.]()![](_page_924_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Vaginal ultrasound]\nIn a vaginal ultrasound, a narrow transducer (called a vaginal wand) is inserted into the vagina to produce images on a monitor. Vaginal ultrasounds may be used in the first trimester of pregnancy for a number of reasons, such as to see a fetus more clearly or to confirm (or rule out) a pregnancy or an abnormality such as an elongated cervix (which can indicate an impending miscarriage) or an ectopic pregnancy.\n\n![Diagram illustrating a vaginal ultrasound procedure. A transducer (Vaginal wand) is inserted into the vagina, and the resulting image of the fetus is displayed on a monitor. Labels include Vagina, Cervix, and Vaginal wand.]()![](_page_924_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *AFP and Triple Screen Blood Tests*]\nAll women are offered one of two blood tests between the 15th and 20th weeks of pregnancy to measure the level of alpha-fetoprotein (more familiarly known simply as AFP), a protein produced by the developing fetus. AFP is present in amniotic fluid and, in smaller amounts, in a pregnant woman's blood. One test measures just AFP. The triple screen blood test measures AFP and two hormones, human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and estriol (a form of estrogen), which are produced by the\n\nplacenta during pregnancy. The interpretation of these measurements is based on factors such as a woman's age, race, and weight.\n\nThese blood tests help evaluate the risk that the f", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "tests", "relation": "evaluate", "tail": "health"}, {"head": "amniocentesis", "relation": "determine", "tail": "genetic abnormality"}, {"head": "ultrasound", "relation": "detect", "tail": "structural abnormalities"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "women", "relation": "choose", "tail": "[Event: not have the tests]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "help", "tail": "[Event: evaluate benefits and risks]"}, {"head": "pregnant women", "relation": "discuss", "tail": "[Event: feelings with your doctor]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: severe or lethal defect were found in the fetus]", "relation": "lead to", "tail": "[Event: terminating a pregnancy]"}]}, "status": "success"}

(An alternative method is to insert a hollow needle through the abdomen into the uterus.) A syringe attached to the catheter is used to withdraw a small sample of tissue containing chorionic villi (small, fingerlike projections) from the placenta. The path of the catheter or needle is guided by ultrasound. The vagina is held open with a vaginal speculum.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the procedure of Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS).

With early diagnosis and careful control of blood glucose during pregnancy, gestational diabetes seldom causes problems for either the pregnant woman or the fetus. Untreated, however, the condition can cause the fetus to be larger than normal (resulting in a more complicated delivery) or to have a low glucose level and chemical imbalances after delivery.\n\nDuring glucose screening, you are given a glucose solution to drink, and a blood sample is taken 1 hour later. If the test shows that your glucose level is elevated, you will have another, more accurate test called the glucose tolerance test (see page 895) to make a diagnosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Group B Strept* Test]\nMost pregnant women are screened for group B streptococcal bacteria that live in the reproductive and urinary systems and seldom cause symptoms. However, during pregnancy, the bacteria can cause infections in the woman's urinary tract and uterus, which, if transmitted to the baby during delivery, can cause serious complications such as pneumonia, blood infection, or inflammation of the membranes covering the brain (meningitis; see page 692). For the group B strep test, the doctor uses a swab to take a sample from the woman's vagina and rectum. The sample is sent to the laboratory, and the cells are grown and tested for the presence of the bacteria. Test results are available within 24 to 48 hours. If you are found to carry the bacteria, you will be given antibiotics intravenously (through a vein) during labor and delivery to prevent your baby from being infected. Although one out of three pregnant women carries the bacteria, only 1 out of 200 babies actually develops an infection. The infection can usually be treated effectively by giving the baby intravenous antibiotics for about 10 days after delivery.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Fetal Monitoring*]\nThroughout pregnancy and labor, doctors can evaluate the health of the fetus by measuring the fetal heart rate. Fetal monitoring is most frequently used during labor to make sure the fetus is getting enough oxygen and to evaluate how the fetus is reacting to the stress of labor, but sometimes is performed earlier in pregnancies considered to be high risk. For example, fetal monitoring may be performed in women who have a medical condition such as high blood pressure or diabetes, who have symptoms of preeclampsia (see page 526), or who have had a fetus die before birth (see page 530). The fetus also is monitored if fetal growth is slower than expected or if the pregnancy has passed the due date.\n\nThe simplest techniques for measuring fetal heart rate are ultrasound imaging (which provides a view of the fetus's beating heart) or listening to the heartbeat through a type of stethoscope (called a fetoscope) placed on the women's abdomen.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Fetal Monitoring* > Nonstress test]\nA nonstress test is a noninvasive test done to evaluate the health of the fetus, usually during the last 3 to 4 months of pregnancy. Doctors measure the fetus's heart rate as the fetus moves inside the uterus, making sure that the fetal heart rate increases in response to environmental factors, indicating that the fetus is healthy. If the fetus's heart rate stays the same or decreases, the doctor may recommend further testing, such as a biophysical\n\nprofile (see below). A nonstress test can also be used to measure the frequency of contractions later in a pregnancy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Fetal Monitoring* > Nonstress test]\nIn a nonstress test, one or two instruments attached to belts are placed on the pregnant woman's abdomen. One of the instruments records the fetus's heart rate; the other instrument measures the length, frequency, and relative intensity of contractions.\n\n![Diagram illustrating a nonstress test setup.

The early signs of pregnancy can include missing a period (when you previously have had regular periods); having an unusually light period; having tender, swollen breasts with darkened nipples; feeling nauseated or vomiting (especially in the morning); urinating frequently; having a heavier than usual vaginal discharge; or feeling unusually tired. Some women have cravings or lose their taste for particular foods or have increased sensitivity to odors. The topics discussed in this section can occur at any time during a pregnancy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Health Concerns During Pregnancy > How a woman's body changes during pregnancy]\nDuring the first weeks of pregnancy, a woman's body changes very little, although her breasts may look somewhat larger. By the 12th week, her enlarging uterus may make her abdomen protrude slightly. By the time she is 28 weeks pregnant, her abdomen may be very prominent and her navel may bulge out. Toward the end of the pregnancy, the head of the fetus may move down into the woman's pelvic cavity, making her abdomen appear somewhat less prominent.\n\n![Illustration showing three stages of pregnancy: 12 weeks, 28 weeks, and 40 weeks. The illustration depicts the woman's body and the developing fetus, showing increasing belly size and the fetus's position.]()![](_page_932_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diet]\nWhat you eat when you're pregnant provides nutrition for your fetus. Eat regular, well-balanced meals that are rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes. To nourish your developing fetus, eat foods that contain essential nutrients such as protein (for cell growth and blood production), calcium (for building strong bones and teeth and developing muscle, heart, and nerve tissue), iron (for producing red blood cells), folic acid (for developing the brain and spinal cord and preventing neural tube defects; see page 398), and zinc (for normal growth and development of the reproductive organs).\n\nMeat, fish, cheese, dried peas and beans, and eggs are excellent sources of protein. Low-fat dairy products are rich in calcium. Good sources of iron include eggs, liver, kidneys, whole-grain or enriched breads and cereals, dried fruit, and green, leafy vegetables. Folic acid is added to breakfast cereals and other grain products and can be obtained from liver, raw green vegetables, and foods that contain yeast. Lean red meat, whole-grain cereals, nuts, peas, and beans are good sources of zinc. Your doctor will probably prescribe vitamins specially formulated for pregnant women. If you are a vegetarian, talk to your doctor and possibly a dietitian to make sure you are getting enough protein and vitamins (particularly vitamins B12 and D) in your diet.\n\nMany women have cravings for particular foods during pregnancy. It's OK to indulge a craving if it's for a nutritious food. High-fat or high-calorie foods can make you gain too much weight, and salty foods can make you retain water. Aversion to certain foods usually is accompanied by nausea or indigestion (see next page). Doctors usually recommend that pregnant women gain about 20 to 30 pounds; gaining too much or too little weight can harm a fetus.\n\nStay well hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Eating fiber-containing foods (such as fresh fruits and vegetables and legumes) can help prevent constipation that can develop from the extra iron you are consuming.\n\nCut back on your caffeine consumption during pregnancy because it can affect sleep and cause cardiac palpitations. Some foods to avoid during pregnancy (because they could harm the fetus) include raw meat, raw eggs, raw fish, and shellfish; unwashed or unpeeled fruits and vegetables (because of pesticide residue); and unpasteurized cheeses and apple juice. No safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy has been established, so you should avoid alcohol entirely throughout your pregnancy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Exercise]\nExercising regularly will keep you in good physical condition and improve your mental state during your pregnancy. It can help control your blood pressure, reduce stress, prevent constipation, tone your muscles, and help you fall asleep. In general, you can continue any exercise you did before you were pregnant as long as it doesn't overtax you or cause excessive straining. Maintain a heart rate of less than 140 beats per minute during exercise. Walking and swimming are good exercises for pregnant women. Avoid strenuous sports and sports in which you or the fetus might be injured. If you are an athlete, your doctor will closely monitor the growth of the fetus and your weight.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Work]\nMany pregnant women continue to work up until labor and delivery.

Get out of bed slowly and sit on the edge of the bed for a minute or two. Try to keep something in your stomach throughout the day. Tell your doctor about the extent of your nausea, especially if it continues or if vomiting is severe. He or she will want to examine you to rule out an underlying condition.\n\nDrinking lots of fluids, especially water, can prevent dehydration. Don't take an antinausea medication unless your doctor has prescribed it. If your vomiting is severe, you may have to be hospitalized and be given fluids and minerals intravenously (through a vein) to replace those you have lost.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Indigestion**]\nIndigestion, often called heartburn, is a burning pain in the center of the upper chest. It is common during pregnancy and affects almost half of all pregnant women. Indigestion occurs during pregnancy because a woman's enlarged abdomen presses on her stomach and esophagus and because the increased level of the female hormone progesterone\n\nduring pregnancy relaxes the muscles in the esophagus that usually prevent the backup of stomach acid. In rare cases, indigestion may be a symptom of polyhydramnios (excess amniotic fluid; see page 526), which puts even more pressure on the abdomen and esophagus. The symptoms of indigestion usually disappear after childbirth unless the indigestion is not related to the pregnancy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Indigestion** > *Prevention and Treatment*]\nTo prevent indigestion, don't eat too much at one time, and avoid highly spiced, greasy, or acidic foods. Eat small, frequent meals. Avoid bending over or lying flat. Try some of the suggestions on page 750 for relieving and preventing indigestion. If these steps don't help, see your doctor. He or she may prescribe an antacid or recommend changes in your diet. If the indigestion persists or is severe, the doctor may order tests to rule out the possibility of a more serious condition.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Indigestion** > **Abdominal Pain**]\nSee your doctor immediately about any abdominal pain during pregnancy. Many women have pain in their abdomen during pregnancy (called round ligament pain) that results from stretching of the ligaments that attach the uterus to the abdominal wall. The pain usually is most severe from the fourth through the sixth month of pregnancy (when the uterus expands most rapidly), but the pain can occur at any time. You can relieve round ligament pain by lying on the aching side. This type of pain usually disappears after childbirth.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Indigestion** > **Urinary Problems**]\nProblems with urination are common in pregnant women. You may urinate more often than usual during pregnancy or feel a strong urge to urinate, which could be caused by hormonal changes and the pressure of your enlarging uterus on the bladder. You may also be thirsty and drink more liquids and therefore excrete more urine than you did before pregnancy. Some pregnant women leak urine (urinary incontinence; see page 877) when they cough or sneeze. Urinary incontinence during pregnancy can result from pressure of the uterus on the bladder and the relaxation of the muscles in the pelvis in preparation for birth.\n\nRelaxation of the pelvic muscles during pregnancy can also lead to urinary tract infections (see page 877), possibly because bacteria can more easily travel up the ureters to the bladder. But urinary tract infections during pregnancy are more likely to be caused by the uterus pressing on the bladder, which makes it more difficult for the bladder to empty completely. If you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection such as painful urination, cloudy urine, or a sore abdomen or back, see your doctor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Fatigue]\nSometimes the first sign of pregnancy is extreme fatigue, which can result from hormonal changes, but may also be caused by anemia (see next page). In addition, as the pregnancy progresses, you are carrying more weight than usual, which can make you more tired. Fatigue is most common during the first and third trimesters. Being pregnant can also cause sleep problems, especially in the last few months, because of discomfort from an enlarging abdomen. Try to rest whenever you can, and get at least 8 hours of sleep every night.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Leg Cramps]\nSome women get sharp pains or cramps in their legs during pregnancy (especially during the last 3 months), possibly from increased pressure of the uterus on the blood vessels that carry blood to the legs, or from a calcium deficiency. These cramps may be followed by dull aching that can last several hours.\n\nTo prevent muscle cramps, take in 1,500 milligrams of calcium every day (either in your diet or in supplements), and stretch your calf muscles before going to bed and first thing in the morning.

Eat citrus fruits and fresh vegetables that contain vitamin C, which helps the body absorb iron more efficiently. Take your prenatal vitamins every day to help ensure that you are getting sufficient amounts of folic acid. Your doctor may prescribe an iron supplement if you are diagnosed with anemia.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Constipation and Hemorrhoids]\nConstipation (see page 769) is common during pregnancy because the increase in hormones can slow the movement of food through the digestive tract. In about the fourth month, constipation sometimes results from pressure on the intestines by the enlarging uterus. Constipation can cause hemorrhoids (see page 777). If you already have hemorrhoids, constipation can worsen them by making you strain harder during bowel movements.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prevention and Treatment*]\nTo prevent constipation, eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and other foods that are high in fiber (see page 37). Drink at least eight glasses of water a day. Some people find prune juice helpful. Don't wait to move your bowels; go whenever you have the urge, but don't strain. Regular exercise can also help keep you regular.\n\nBefore taking any medications for constipation, talk to your doctor. You probably can safely use milk of magnesia or glycerin suppositories while you are pregnant, but don't use other over-the-counter laxatives.\n\nIf none of these measures work, your doctor may prescribe medication to soften your stools. If you have hemorrhoids, take warm baths. Check with your doctor before using any hemorrhoid creams or suppositories.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prevention and Treatment* > Varicose Veins]\nMany women develop swollen veins in their legs (varicose veins; see page 602) during pregnancy, especially during the last 3 months. During pregnancy, the veins are carrying an increased volume of blood to supply to the developing fetus. In addition, as the uterus enlarges and presses on some major veins, blood flow from the leg veins up to the pelvis can slow down. This combination of factors sometimes produces enough pressure to cause the veins in the calves and thighs to become swollen and painful. The same kinds of pressure can also affect the veins around the entrance to the vagina and rectum.\n\nYou are more likely to develop varicose veins during pregnancy if you have a family history of the condition. Varicose veins that develop during pregnancy usually become significantly less swollen or disappear within 12 weeks of delivery.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prevention and Treatment*]\nTo reduce your risk of developing varicose veins, don't wear clothes that fit tightly around your waist or upper legs. Avoid standing for long periods, but take regular walks every day. Rest with your feet up (preferably higher than the level of your heart) as much as possible. Don't gain too much weight during your pregnancy because the excess weight can put more strain on your veins. Your doctor may recommend wearing\n\nelastic support stockings to help improve your circulation. Put the stockings on in the morning before you get out of bed.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sleep Problems]\nMany women find it difficult to get to sleep or stay asleep while they are pregnant. Sleep problems can result from changes in hormone levels, a need to urinate more often, or emotional stress (for example, worrying about your health or the health of your baby). Toward the end of pregnancy, you may find it difficult to find a comfortable position for sleeping. Sleep is essential for good health—for both you and your fetus. Lack of sleep can make you susceptible to infections and can lead to irritability.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sleep Problems > *Prevention and Treatment*]\nIf you have trouble falling asleep at night, avoid napping during the later part of the day. Take a warm bath and drink a glass of warm milk before going to bed. Because caffeine is a stimulant, cut back on or eliminate coffee, tea, or other caffeine-containing foods or beverages from your diet. Get plenty of exercise during the day, but don't exercise within a few hours of going to bed. Try performing some relaxation exercises (see page 59) at bedtime.\n\nIf you are losing a lot of sleep, talk to your doctor. Most doctors prefer not to prescribe sleep medications such as sedatives because of the possibility of affecting the fetus. This is especially true during the critical first 14 weeks, when the fetus's organs are developing, and in the days closer to the due date, when the medication could suppress the baby's nervous system and affect his or her breathing during labor and delivery. Don't take any medications—including over-the-counter or alternative sleep aids such as the hormone melatonin—unless your doctor has prescribed them.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Back Pai", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "iron", "relation": "treats", "tail": "anemia"}, {"head": "prenatal vitamins", "relation": "helps", "tail": "folic acid"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

If you have an underlying heart defect such as a congenital heart defect (see page 389), or a heart valve disease caused by rheumatic fever, you have a risk of heart failure. Your doctor should know about any heart conditions before you get pregnant—or at least as soon as the pregnancy is confirmed. Your doctor may refer you to a cardiologist (heart specialist) for additional care during your pregnancy. The cardiologist will monitor your health throughout your pregnancy for any possible complications related to the heart disorder.\n\nSometimes a heart disorder such as a murmur (abnormal heart sounds) shows up for the first time during pregnancy from the extra demands placed on the heart. Most heart murmurs discovered in the first 3 months of pregnancy are insignificant, but the doctor may order tests such as an ultrasound image of the heart (echocardiogram; see page 561) or a recording of the electrical activity of the heart (electrocardiogram; see page 559) to evaluate the condition.\n\nIf you have a heart condition, you will have to deliver in a hospital. If you have no complications, your pregnancy should be healthy and you should go into labor normally at full term. When you go into labor, your doctor will help make sure that the delivery is as easy as possible for you—with a minimum of pushing, which puts a strain on the heart and deprives it of oxygen.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Heart Disorders** > *Treatment*]\nThe main treatment for a heart disorder during pregnancy is rest to reduce strain on the heart, which is already working harder than usual. When you are lying down, keep shifting your position and relaxing and contracting your muscles to keep the blood moving through your legs to prevent blood clots. Restrict your intake of salt and salty foods to prevent fluid retention. Many standard antihypertensive medications have potentially harmful effects on the fetus and usually are not recommended during pregnancy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Heart Disorders** > **Gestational Diabetes**]\nGestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that can develop during pregnancy. The condition can occur because the placenta produces hormones that can block the effects of the hormone insulin, which moves glucose into cells for energy. This insulin-blocking effect usually develops between the 20th and 24th weeks of pregnancy. The pancreas can usually overcome this effect by producing more insulin, but if it cannot make enough insulin to overcome the effects of the insulin-blocking hormones, glucose builds up in the pregnant woman's blood, causing gestational diabetes. The condition goes away after pregnancy because there is no placenta to produce the insulin-blocking hormones.\n\nYou are at increased risk of having gestational diabetes if you are obese, have a family history of diabetes, previously gave birth to a very large infant (weighing more than 9 pounds, 14 ounces), had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy, had a stillbirth (see page 530) or a child with a birth defect, or are older than 25.\n\nWhen diagnosed and treated, gestational diabetes usually does not cause problems for either the pregnant woman or the fetus. If not treated, however, gestational diabetes can produce an excessive amount of amniotic fluid in the uterus (which can stretch the uterus into the abdomen, making breathing difficult) and life-threatening high blood pressure (preeclampsia; see page 526) in the pregnant woman. The fetus may grow very large from the excess glucose in the woman's blood (which can make delivery difficult); after birth, a baby may have low blood sugar, respiratory problems, or neonatal jaundice (see page 382).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nGestational diabetes seldom causes symptoms in the early stages. For this reason, all women are offered a glucose screening test (see page 512) during pregnancy. If your blood glucose level is found to be elevated on the screening test, you will then have a more accurate diagnostic test called the glucose tolerance test. For this test, you will be asked to eat a high-carbohydrate diet for 3 days and then to fast overnight (for 10 to 14 hours) before the test. You will be given a strong solution of glucose to drink, and blood samples will be taken and evaluated every hour for 3 hours to determine if you have a high glucose level, indicating gestational diabetes.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nGestational diabetes is usually treated with a carefully controlled diet. If you are diagnosed with gestational diabetes, your doctor will prescribe a diet to help keep your blood glucose level in the normal range. The doctor will probably refer you to a registered dietitian, who can help you plan meals to meet your needs. Most women with gestational diabetes require three meals a day and a bedtime snack.

If the miscarriage occurs later in the pregnancy, the bleeding can range from a few drops of blood to a heavy flow. The bleeding may start with no warning or may be preceded by a brownish discharge. A threatened miscarriage is often painless.\n\nIf the fetus has died, a miscarriage is usually unavoidable (called an inevitable miscarriage). An inevitable miscarriage is usually accompanied by cramping pain in the lower abdomen or back. The pain can be either dull and constant or sharp and intermittent. If you pass any solid tissue from your vagina, save it in a jar to bring to your doctor for examination. The doctor can tell by looking at the tissue if you have eliminated all of the fetus and placenta. He or she will also send the tissue to a laboratory for microscopic examination to try to determine the cause of the miscarriage.\n\nIf any parts of the fetus or placenta remain in the uterus, it is called an incomplete miscarriage. If a miscarriage is incomplete, you may have constant or intermittent bleeding and pain for several days. If an incomplete miscarriage is not diagnosed, the bleeding can continue and the tissue left in the uterus can become infected.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > Vaginal Bleeding During Pregnancy]\nNotify your doctor if you have vaginal bleeding at any time during your pregnancy. Bleeding can be a sign of a serious problem. In early pregnancy, about 20 percent of women have some slight vaginal bleeding, or spotting, such as when the fertilized egg implants in the uterus.\n\nNotify your doctor, call 911 or your local emergency number, or go to a hospital emergency department immediately if you have any vaginal bleeding in the last 6 months of your pregnancy. Bleeding can indicate a miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy. Vaginal bleeding (sometimes called antepartum hemorrhage) after the 20th week of pregnancy, usually in the last 3 months, affects fewer than 2 out of 100 women and may indicate the onset of preterm labor (see page 529), a burst varicose vein, damage to the cervix, placenta previa (see page 527), partial or complete separation of the placenta from the wall of the uterus (placental abruption; see page 527), or another serious complication.\n\nIn rare cases, a fetus dies in the uterus but the woman has no symptoms of miscarriage (called a missed miscarriage). Although you do not have symptoms of a miscarriage in a missed miscarriage, you will no longer experience any of the symptoms of pregnancy. Missed miscarriages are often discovered on a prenatal visit when the doctor notices that the uterus has not increased in size.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > Keeping a Kick Chart]\nAn active fetus is usually a healthy fetus. Your doctor may ask you to keep a record of how active your fetus is with a kick chart. He or she may give you a chart (or you can make a chart yourself) to log the movements of your fetus for a day or two. He or she will ask you to record the kicks at the time of day when your fetus is most active. Discuss the results of the kick chart with your doctor. Healthy fetuses may kick only 10 times a day or kick eight or more times in their most active hour. Keep in mind, however, that the number of movements can vary, and some perfectly healthy babies may not kick much. Also, fetuses move less toward the end of pregnancy, when space is more limited inside the uterus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nIf the vaginal bleeding stops or is not very heavy, your doctor may recommend that you rest in bed at home. If the pregnancy seems to be continuing despite the bleeding, your\n\ndoctor may arrange for you to have a series of blood tests to measure the level of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) to confirm that the pregnancy is continuing, and an ultrasound to make sure that the developing fetus is still alive. Don't have sexual intercourse for a few weeks after you have vaginal bleeding because sex can stimulate labor contractions. Ask your doctor about other precautions to take.\n\nNo known medical treatment can stop a threatened miscarriage. If you are having a miscarriage, the doctor may recommend that you rest in bed, or at least stay close to home, until the fetus is expelled. In the case of an inevitable or missed miscarriage, your doctor may remove the fetus and placenta by suction or by a D and C (see page 869). For an incomplete miscarriage, he or she will remove any tissue that remains in the uterus. These procedures are usually performed in a hospital but may be done in the doctor's office or in a clinic.\n\nSome women benefit from short-term psychological counseling after a miscarriage, especially if they were trying to get pregnant. After a miscarriage, you can safely start trying to conceive again in about 6 to 8 weeks.

If the fertilized egg continues to grow inside the tube, it eventually can cause the tube to burst, which can be life-threatening.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the female reproductive system showing the Fallopian tube, Ovary, and Uterus. An inset magnifies the Fallopian tube, labeling it 'Embryo in fallopian tube'.]()![](_page_951_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nIf you have had an ectopic pregnancy, your doctor may recommend waiting until you have had one or two periods before trying to get pregnant again to give your body a chance to heal. Because a woman who has had an ectopic pregnancy is at increased risk of having another one, you will need to have the pregnancy confirmed as early as possible to make sure it is progressing normally (inside the uterus).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Incompetent Cervix]\nIf a woman has an incompetent cervix, her cervix is weak and dilates (widens) under the weight of the fetus and placenta during pregnancy. The fetus and placenta can drop down out of the uterus, resulting in miscarriage (see page 522), usually after the 14th week of pregnancy. The cause of incompetent cervix is usually unknown, but the cervix sometimes can be weakened from past medical procedures such as a biopsy in which a large amount of tissue was taken from the cervix (cone biopsy). Incompetent cervix also can occur in women whose mothers took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) when they were pregnant to prevent miscarriage. (DES was prescribed from the 1940s to the 1970s.)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Incompetent Cervix > Incompetent cervix]\nIf a woman's cervix is weak, the increasing weight of the developing fetus can cause the cervix to open and widen prematurely. As a result, the membranes that surround the fetus may bulge down through the cervix and rupture, causing a miscarriage.\n\n![Diagram of a pregnant uterus showing the fetus, placenta, and cervix. Labels include Placenta, Uterus, Membranes bulging through cervix, and Cervix.]()![](_page_952_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nIf you are pregnant and have had a miscarriage because of an incompetent cervix, or if your doctor thinks that you may have an incompetent cervix, he or she may perform surgery early in your pregnancy to correct the weakness. For this procedure, you will be given spinal or general anesthesia, and the doctor will tighten your cervix using a piece of strong thread. Your doctor may prescribe medication to reduce the risk that the surgery will stimulate preterm labor (see page 529). He or she may recommend that you rest as much as possible and abstain from sexual intercourse until the delivery. At about the 37th week of pregnancy or when you go into labor, the thread is cut to allow the fetus and placenta to pass through the cervix.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Multiple Fetuses]\nTwins occur as a result of either the splitting of a single fertilized egg or the parallel development of two fertilized eggs. Twins account for 1 in 90 births in the United States (triplets, by contrast, are uncommon and occur in only 1 in 8,000 births). Two out of three sets of twins are fraternal (nonidentical), which means that two different eggs from the woman were fertilized by two different sperm from the man. Identical twins develop from one egg, fertilized by one sperm, that splits shortly after fertilization. Fraternal twins each have a placenta; identical twins share a placenta. Identical twins have identical genetic makeup, while fraternal twins are no more alike genetically than other siblings.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Multiple Fetuses > Fraternal and identical twins]\nFraternal twins result when two separate eggs are fertilized by two different sperm. Each twin gets nourishment from his or her own placenta. Identical twins result when a single egg that has been fertilized by one sperm divides into two identical embryos. Identical twins share a placenta.\n\nDiagram illustrating Fraternal (nonidentical) twins. Two separate embryos are shown, each enclosed in its own separate placenta.\n\nPlacenta\n\nFraternal (nonidentical) twins\n\n![](_page_953_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nDiagram illustrating Identical twins.

The outlook is usually good for both the pregnant woman and the fetuses if the woman has adequate prenatal care, rest, and good nutrition. If you are having twins, your doctor may recommend that you take additional vitamin and mineral supplements throughout your pregnancy.

The symptoms of severe preeclampsia include headaches, blurred vision, intolerance to bright light, upper abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and bloating.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf you have preeclampsia, your doctor will recommend that you get lots of rest and reduce your salt intake to help lower your blood pressure. He or she may prescribe a medication to control your blood pressure. The doctor will order ultrasound scans regularly to monitor the fetus's growth and to watch for a buildup of amniotic fluid. If you have symptoms of severe preeclampsia or of eclampsia, you will be admitted to a hospital immediately and will be given medication to lower your blood pressure and remove excess fluid from your body. Your doctor may recommend immediate delivery by inducing labor (see page 533) or performing a cesarean delivery (see page 534).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Placenta Previa and Placental Abruption]\nNormally, the placenta is attached to the top portion of the uterus. Any part of the placenta that is near the cervix (the opening into the uterus) is poorly supported and vulnerable to damage. In placenta previa, the placenta develops low in the uterus, either partially or completely covering the cervix and blocking the entrance to the vagina. The weight of the fetus puts pressure on the part of the placenta that covers the cervix, sometimes causing bleeding if part of the placenta detaches from the wall of the uterus. Placenta previa occurs in about 1 in 200 pregnancies after the 28th week.\n\nThe cause of placenta previa is unknown. It occurs more frequently in women who have given birth to several children and in pregnancies with multiple fetuses (see page 525). In some cases, the placenta is low in the uterus early in pregnancy but then moves up the wall of the uterus to a more normal position as the pregnancy progresses, where it usually does not interfere with delivery.\n\nIf the placenta ruptures or tears, causing heavy bleeding, it can cut off the blood supply to the fetus. In placental abruption, a placenta that is positioned normally in the uterus separates prematurely from the uterine wall. Placental abruption is more common in women who have high blood pressure (see page 520). Placental abruption may be linked to a deficiency of the B vitamin folic acid.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nPlacenta previa may cause no symptoms. If the placenta becomes partly detached from the uterus, the woman will have sporadic bleeding but usually no pain. Placental abruption may cause some pain along with the bleeding. However, in some cases, placental abruption causes no bleeding because the blood is trapped between the wall\n\nof the uterus and the placenta. This collection of blood can trigger preterm labor (see page 529).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nIf the placenta is only partially blocking your cervix, your doctor may recommend resting in bed, avoiding sexual intercourse, and limiting other physical activity. He or she will use ultrasound (see page 509) to monitor the health of the fetus and the position of the placenta.\n\nIf you have vaginal bleeding, call your doctor immediately. (Don't try to stop the bleeding by putting in a tampon.) If the bleeding is light or stops on its own and the fetus is not in any danger, your doctor will probably monitor your condition with ultrasound. If the bleeding is severe, you may need to have a blood transfusion, and the baby will be delivered as soon as possible by cesarean (see page 534). Severe bleeding is dangerous but rarely fatal to the pregnant woman, but it can be fatal to the fetus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment* > Placenta previa]\nThe normal placement of the placenta is near the top of the uterus. In placenta previa, the placenta is attached at the bottom of the uterus, where it can partially or completely cover the cervix. If the placenta reaches to the edge of the cervix but does not cover it, the condition is called marginal placenta previa (left). In partial placenta previa (center), the placenta blocks part of the cervix. In complete placenta previa (right), the placenta covers the entire cervix.\n\n![Diagram illustrating Marginal placenta previa. The placenta is attached near the bottom of the uterus, covering the cervix but not reaching the edge.]()![](_page_957_Picture_6.jpeg)\n\nMarginal placenta previa\n\n![Diagram illustrating Partial placenta previa.

A fetus's growth is determined to be retarded if the fetus's weight falls below the fifth percentile. The inability of the placenta to supply nourishment can result from scarring in areas of the placenta where tissue has died from lack of blood. The obstruction of blood flow can result from preeclampsia (see page 526), high blood pressure (see page 520), vaginal bleeding (see page 523), or placenta previa or placental abruption (see page 527). Retarded fetal growth can also occur when the pregnant woman has a heart disorder (see page 520) or diabetes (see page 521), or when she smokes cigarettes, drinks alcohol or uses other drugs, or is malnourished during pregnancy.\n\nA newborn whose growth is stunted has less body fat (and therefore is less able to resist cold) and is more susceptible to having low blood sugar (hypoglycemia; see page 897) than an infant who is at a normal weight. Low-birth-weight babies have more medical and developmental problems, some of which can be life-threatening. If the infant is preterm (see left), he or she may have complications such as respiratory distress syndrome (see page 381).\n\nTo help ensure that your baby is born healthy, go to all of your scheduled prenatal appointments. If you are beyond the 30th week of your pregnancy and think that your fetus is not moving as much as before, your doctor may recommend that you keep a kick chart (see page 523) to record fetal movements. To monitor the fetus's condition, your doctor may recommend that you have an ultrasound and tests that measure the fetus's heartbeat.\n\nIf your doctor thinks that your fetus's growth may be stunted, he or she will discuss moving up the delivery date by inducing labor (see page 533) or by performing a cesarean (see page 534). A fetus that is not growing normally inside the uterus may do better in a neonatal intensive care unit. Your doctor will recommend that you deliver in a hospital that has a neonatal intensive care unit so that any problems your baby has can be treated promptly by trained neonatal specialists.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Postterm Pregnancy]\nIdeally, labor starts when the fetus is fully mature and able to survive outside the uterus. Most women give birth between the 37th and 42nd weeks of pregnancy. A pregnancy that goes beyond the 42nd week is called a postterm pregnancy, or postmaturity.\n\nPostterm pregnancies occur most frequently in women who have gestational diabetes (see page 521) or a family history of diabetes (see page 894).\n\nA placenta that has been providing nourishment to a fetus for longer than 42 weeks may not be able to provide a large fetus with a sufficient amount of oxygenated blood, which can cause an abnormal heart rate or brain damage. The placenta can also stop functioning normally, reducing the amount of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus or causing the fetus to secrete less urine, thereby reducing the volume of amniotic fluid. Because amniotic fluid provides cushioning between the fetus and the uterine wall, a deficiency of fluid (oligohydramnios; see page 526) can cause the umbilical cord to be squeezed, cutting off the fetus's supply of oxygen and nutrients. Postterm fetuses may be too large to deliver vaginally. In addition, they may be so mature that they excrete their first bowel movement (called meconium) into the amniotic fluid, which can be life-threatening if they inhale the meconium and it blocks their air passages. The death rate of infants who are delivered long after the due date is almost double that of infants who are delivered closer to term.\n\nIf your doctor thinks that your pregnancy is postterm, he or she will use ultrasound and fetal monitoring (see page 533) to ensure that the fetus is healthy. Your doctor will induce labor (see page 533) only if there are medical reasons to do so or if your cervix has started to dilate (widen). He or she will monitor your labor and delivery carefully and, if your baby seems to be in distress, may use forceps or other techniques to assist the delivery or may perform a cesarean delivery (see page 534).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Stillbirth]\nDeath of the fetus, or stillbirth, is the death of a fetus after the 18th week of pregnancy. In many cases, stillbirth results from a severe abnormality in the fetus, severe preeclampsia or eclampsia (see page 526), vaginal bleeding (see page 523), or postterm pregnancy (see left). It is also linked to gestational diabetes (see page 521), high blood pressure (see page 520), Rh incompatibility (see page 508), and infections in the pregnant woman. In many cases, the cause of death is unknown.\n\nIn most cases, the only indication that a fetus has died inside the uterus is lack of fetal movement.

You will be told to push only when you are having a contraction, because the contractions double the effect of your pushing, allowing you to rest between contractions, which helps you conserve energy. An episiotomy (see page 533) may be performed toward the end of the second stage of labor, before the baby's head emerges.\n\nThe second stage of labor ends when the baby is completely out of the vagina. Immediately after birth, the umbilical cord (which has connected the baby to the placenta) is tied and cut. The second stage can last up to 3 hours for a first baby and 2 hours for a subsequent delivery.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Second Stage: Delivery* > **Labor and delivery**]\nDuring the first stage of labor, uterine contractions increase in strength and frequency and move the baby down into the birth canal (top). When the cervix is fully dilated, the contractions become stronger, pushing the baby farther down the birth canal and out of the vagina (bottom).\n\n![Diagram showing a fetus in the uterus, illustrating the position for the baby's head to move through the pelvis during labor.]()![](_page_964_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nConstrictions move the baby's head through the pelvis\n\n![Diagram showing the baby's head emerging through the vaginal opening during labor.]()![](_page_964_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\nBaby's head emerges through the vaginal opening\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Second Stage: Delivery* > *Third Stage: Expelling the Placenta*]\nIn the third stage of labor, after delivery of the baby, the placenta detaches from the uterine wall and is expelled from the uterus (afterbirth). Constrictions (usually less painful than those of labor) help the uterus expel the placenta. Doctors often assist the delivery of the placenta by massaging the woman's abdomen and pulling gently on the umbilical cord during contractions.\n\nThe third stage can last from a few minutes to half an hour. After the placenta has been expelled, the mother may be given medication to prevent excessive bleeding. The doctor cleans and stitches any incisions from the episiotomy (see next page) or tears in the vagina.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Second Stage: Delivery* > **Pain Relief During Labor and Delivery**]\nThe intensity of pain during labor varies significantly from woman to woman and is partly influenced by a woman's expectations. If you are frightened or tense, you may feel pain more acutely. If you attended childbirth classes with your labor coach, you\n\nwill know what to expect and probably will be better prepared to deal with the pain. You can help ease contractions by staying upright and active as long as possible (without tiring yourself out); in addition, gravity helps the baby descend and speeds up dilation of the cervix. Breathe slowly and deeply during and after each contraction. Try a variety of positions to find the ones that are most comfortable.\n\nYou may not need pain relief during labor but, if you do, several options are available. Because some pain relievers can affect the baby's breathing if given late in labor, your doctor may give you pain medication only if the first stage of labor is very painful and if he or she is sure that delivery is not imminent. Medications for pain relief are carefully chosen so that if a baby is delivered soon after the medication is administered, the baby can be given another medication to reverse the effect of the pain medication.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Second Stage: Delivery* > *Pudendal Block*]\nVaginal pain can be relieved by an anesthetic called a pudendal block, which is injected into the tissue of the vagina. A pudendal block is often used just before a forceps delivery (see page 534), or before an episiotomy (see next page), in which an incision is made in the perineum (the skin between the opening of the vagina and the anus) to allow the baby to pass through the vagina more easily.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Second Stage: Delivery* > *Epidural and Spinal Anesthesia*]\nIf your pain is severe, the doctor may recommend epidural (see below) or spinal anesthesia for pain relief. For an epidural, the doctor or an anesthesiologist injects an anesthetic into the space surrounding the spinal cord at the base of the spine (epidural space). The anesthetic is infused through a thin, flexible tube (catheter) to provide small doses of the anesthetic as needed during labor and delivery. An epidural numbs the body from the waist down.\n\nSpinal anesthesia is similar to an epidural except that it is given in one injection, and it paralyzes, not just numbs, the body from the waist down. Spinals are used mostly for cesarean deliveries (see page 534) because vaginal deliveries require the mother to be able to help push the baby through the birth canal.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Second Stage: Delivery* > **Epidural anesthesia**]\nEpidural anesthes", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "contractions", "relation": "double the effect of", "tail": "pushing"}, {"head": "episiotomy", "relation": "may be performed", "tail": "second stage of labor"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "mother", "relation": "having a contraction", "tail": "[Event: second stage]"}, {"head": "baby", "relation": "emerges", "tail": "[Event: end of the second stage]"}, {"head": "umbilical cord", "relation": "tied and cut", "tail": "[Event: immediately after birth]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: episiotomy]", "relation": "may be performed", "tail": "[Event: end of the second stage]"}, {"head": "[Event: contractions]", "relation": "double the effect of", "tail": "[Event: pushing]"}]}, "status": "success"}

An episiotomy is also sometimes performed to avoid irregular tearing of the vagina, which can be more difficult to stitch up than a straight cut. Episiotomies are usually performed toward the end of the second stage of labor, before the baby's head emerges.\n\nAfter injecting a local anesthetic, the doctor usually makes a small, straight cut in the perineum (the area of skin between the opening of the vagina and the anus) from the vagina to the anus; this is called a midline episiotomy. For a mediolateral episiotomy, the cut is made at an angle from the vagina to the left or right of the anus. After delivery, the incision is closed with stitches that gradually dissolve. The incision usually heals rapidly, although the scar may cause discomfort for up to 3 months.\n\nTo relieve discomfort in the area around the incision, your doctor will recommend periodically using an ice pack for a few minutes, sitting in a shallow tub of warm water, or sitting on a doughnut-shaped pillow. To help prevent infection, rinse the area with warm water and pat it dry each time you use the toilet.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Episiotomy]\nIn a midline episiotomy, the incision is made straight from the vagina toward the anus. In a mediolateral episiotomy, the incision is made to the side and at an angle to the anus.\n\nA midline incision is the most common type of episiotomy because it cuts through less tissue and usually causes less discomfort than a mediolateral episiotomy. A mediolateral episiotomy may be necessary if a baby is very large or if forceps are used for delivery.\n\n![Diagram illustrating two types of episiotomy: Midline episiotomy and Mediolateral episiotomy.

There are several different types of forceps used for different circumstances. For example, they may be used to protect the baby's head in a breech (buttocks first) presentation (see next page) or in a preterm delivery (see page 529). When epidural anesthesia (see page 532) has been used toward the end of labor, forceps are often used to assist delivery because a woman may not feel the urge to push. Forceps also are frequently used if the woman is unable to push or if the baby is showing signs of distress.\n\nAn episiotomy (see previous page) is usually performed before forceps are used, and the woman is usually given a local anesthetic or epidural anesthesia. The doctor inserts the forceps into the vagina along both sides of the baby's head and gently pulls the baby out as the woman pushes with her contractions. The risks of using forceps range from temporary marks on the baby's cheeks or ears to nerve damage or injury to the woman's vagina. Most nerve damage is temporary. A forceps delivery is usually less risky than a cesarean (see below) for both the woman and the baby.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Episiotomy > *Vacuum Extraction*]\nVacuum extraction is sometimes performed as an alternative to forceps delivery. The doctor places a suction cup (which is attached to a vacuum pump) on the baby's head in\n\nthe birth canal. The pump is turned on to secure the baby's head to the cup, and the doctor gently pulls the baby out of the vagina with each contraction.\n\nVacuum extraction poses less risk of vaginal injury than a forceps delivery, although you may still have an episiotomy before delivery. The baby may have slight swelling of his or her scalp from the vacuum cup, but this will disappear in a few days.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Cesarean Delivery*]\nCesarean delivery (also called cesarean section or, for short, C-section) is a surgical procedure in which the baby is delivered through incisions in the wall of the uterus and in the lower abdomen. A cesarean delivery is usually done when it would be safer or easier than a vaginal delivery. Reasons for having a cesarean delivery include having a large baby or multiple babies, prolonged labor or failure of labor to progress, fetal distress, a breech presentation (see next page), or a medical condition the woman has.\n\nIf you have previously delivered a baby by cesarean, you and your doctor will weigh the benefits and risks of having another cesarean delivery. Many women who have delivered a baby by cesarean can later have a successful vaginal delivery. However, there is a risk of uterine rupture at the site of the cesarean incision.\n\nThe preparation for a cesarean delivery is similar to that for other surgical procedures.

Disproportion can occur in women of any size or height but is more common in small-boned women and in women who are shorter than 5 feet. In some cases, a woman's pelvis is disproportionately small because of a previous injury. Disproportion can also occur if the baby's head is abnormally large, as with babies who have hydrocephalus (see page 400).\n\nIf your doctor suspects that your pelvis may be too small for the baby's head to pass through, he or she will perform an ultrasound of your pelvis. If the disproportion seems severe, the doctor will probably recommend a cesarean delivery (see page 534). If the disproportion is not too severe, he or she may decide to proceed with a vaginal delivery but closely monitor the baby's condition throughout labor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prolapse of the Umbilical Cord*]\nA prolapsed umbilical cord occurs during (and in rare cases before) delivery when the umbilical cord drops down into the cervix or vagina. A compressed cord can cut off the fetus's blood and oxygen supplies, causing severe damage to or death of the fetus within minutes. A prolapsed cord can occur with conditions such as polyhydramnios (see page 526), breech presentation (see page 535), or premature rupture of the membranes (see page 528). Pressure on the umbilical cord must be relieved immediately, usually by cesarean delivery (see page 534).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prolapse of the Umbilical Cord* > **Prolapsed umbilical cord**]\nA prolapsed umbilical cord is an umbilical cord that has moved into the vagina before the baby's head. A prolapsed cord can become compressed or squeezed and cut off the\n\nbaby's supply of blood and oxygen. An emergency cesarean delivery is usually necessary.\n\n![Diagram of a fetus in the uterus showing the Uterus, Cervix, and Umbilical cord.]()![](_page_974_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prolapse of the Umbilical Cord* > *Excessive Bleeding After Delivery*]\nPostpartum hemorrhage is excessive loss of blood from the uterus or vagina after delivery. Bleeding often occurs when the uterine contractions are not strong enough to enable the uterus to shrink back to its original shape and compress the blood vessels in the uterus. (The contractions limit bleeding caused by the separation of the placenta from the uterus.) The muscles of the uterus may be weakened by an unusually long labor or stretched excessively by multiple fetuses or by multiple previous deliveries. Bleeding also can result when fragments of the placenta remain inside the uterus and prevent it from contracting sufficiently after childbirth. Excessive bleeding can also occur if the vagina was torn during delivery.\n\nBleeding from the uterus can be controlled with medications that stimulate the uterus to contract. If fragments of placenta remain inside the uterus, they will be removed. If the bleeding has resulted from torn vaginal tissues, the tear will be closed with stitches after the area has been numbed with a local anesthetic. Bleeding that is life-threatening may require surgical removal of the uterus (hysterectomy; see page 870).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prolapse of the Umbilical Cord* > *Retained Placenta*]\nThe placenta usually separates easily from the wall of the uterus after delivery. The doctor may assist the separation of the placenta by pressing on the woman's abdomen (which helps the uterus contract) while at the same time pulling gently on the umbilical cord. Massaging the abdomen not only helps the uterus contract but also helps stop bleeding. Occasionally the placenta becomes trapped inside the uterus if it doesn't separate completely from the uterine wall. A retained placenta is a placenta that hasn't been expelled within 30 minutes of delivery.\n\nA retained placenta is removed by the doctor. After giving you an anesthetic, the doctor will reach inside your uterus with his or her hand and remove the placenta. You will then be given medication to help your uterus contract and prevent excessive bleeding.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prolapse of the Umbilical Cord* > Delivering the placenta]\nThe uterus continues to contract after delivery until the placenta (afterbirth) is delivered, completing the third and final stage of labor. To help expel the placenta, the doctor massages the woman's abdomen and, while the uterine contractions push the placenta out, the doctor gently pulls on the umbilical cord (which is attached to the placenta).\n\n![Diagram illustrating the delivery of the placenta.

Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. Your choice will be based mostly on your personal preferences and your lifestyle. Feeding your baby, whether by breast or bottle, is an important time for you to form a strong emotional attachment to your baby, which is just as essential to your baby's growth and development as nutrition.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Feeding Your Baby** > *Breastfeeding*]\nFor various reasons, not all women want to (or can) breastfeed. However, breastfeeding has many benefits for both mother and child. Doctors recommend\n\nbreastfeeding as the most beneficial nutrition for babies in their first year of life. Breast milk provides the perfect mix of nutrients that infants need to develop properly, and it causes fewer food allergies and fewer digestive problems (such as constipation) than formula. Breast milk also provides a newborn with infection-fighting antibodies from the mother's body and reduces the incidence of ear, respiratory, and digestive tract infections during the first few years of life. Breastfeeding is convenient because breast milk is always available and requires no preparation, and you can feed your baby whenever he or she is hungry. Breastfed babies do not gain weight as quickly as bottled babies, and breastfed babies seldom become overweight.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Breastfeeding]\nThe hormone prolactin, which stimulates milk production, is produced by the pituitary gland in the brain. After childbirth, the pituitary gland releases prolactin into the mother's bloodstream, where it stimulates milk production. When a baby sucks on the breast, the stimulation from the sucking sends a signal to the pituitary gland to release more prolactin to trigger milk production. Milk flows from the milk-producing glands at the back of the breast into tiny sacs called milk ducts under the woman's areola (the darker area surrounding the nipple). The pressure of the baby's mouth on the areola squeezes milk from the milk ducts out through the nipple. Feeding a baby alternately from both breasts helps ensure that both breasts receive equal stimulation to produce an equal amount of milk.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the process of breastfeeding. (1) The baby's sucking sends a signal to the pituitary to release more prolactin. (2) The pituitary gland releases prolactin. (3) Prolactin triggers milk production. Milk flows from the milk-producing glands at the back of the breast into tiny sacs called milk ducts under the woman's areola.]()![](_page_979_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\nFor the mother, breastfeeding helps the uterus get back to its normal size more quickly. Also, because you are burning calories when you breastfeed, you will lose weight faster. Breastfeeding longer than 3 months confers some protection to women against developing breast cancer later in life.\n\nIf you have any problems in the first few days of breastfeeding, don't be discouraged. Talk to your doctor and to friends who have breastfed and ask for tips. Call or attend group meetings of the local La Leche League, a volunteer group that offers practical advice and encouragement to women who are breastfeeding.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Breastfeeding > ***Bottle-Feeding***]\nMany women choose to bottle-feed their babies. If this is your choice, you should not feel guilty that you are depriving your baby in any way. Formula provides the nutrients your infant needs to develop and grow, and you bond with your baby when you hold him or her for feedings. Make sure that you prepare the formula according to the package instructions. Some people prefer the convenience of bottle-feeding because other people can help out with feedings. It also gives the father and older siblings an opportunity to participate in feedings and form their own attachment to the baby.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Breastfeeding > ***Bottle-Feeding*** > **Bottle-feeding**]\nBottle-feeding can give other people, particularly fathers, a chance to feed and bond with a baby. A baby who fusses soon after sucking on a bottle may be having trouble with the nipple or formula. Make sure that the hole in the nipple is not clogged or too small and that the formula is not too hot.\n\n![A black and white illustration of a man, likely a father, sitting and feeding a baby from a bottle.]()![](_page_981_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Postpartum Depression]\nMany women feel blue during the first few days after childbirth. This is normal. New mothers usually are very tired. First-time mothers may be afraid, anxious, or overwhelmed by their new responsibilities and challenges. Some women may have a sense of letdown after anticipating the birth for so many months.

At the turn of the 20th century, life expectancy in the United States was only 46. Today, life expectancy is approaching 80, an astounding 75 percent increase in one century, greater than at any other time in history.\n\nStill, death is inevitable, and for many of us, it is a process that occurs slowly over a period of weeks or months. Unlike a sudden, unexpected death, a slow death can give a dying person and his or her family and friends the opportunity to come to terms with death (and to prepare for it).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Dying and Death > The 10 Leading Causes of Death in the United States]\nFollowing are the 10 leading causes of death in the United States in 2000.\n\nThe information comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n1. Heart disease\n2. Cancer\n3. Stroke\n4. Chronic lower respiratory disease\n5. Accidents\n6. Diabetes\n7. Pneumonia and influenza\n8. Alzheimer's disease\n9. Kidney disease\n10. Blood poisoning\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Dying and Death > Terminal Illness]\nA terminally ill person should decide the timing and extent of any discussion about death, including organ donation or funeral arrangements. If a terminally ill person asks questions about dying, he or she may have, to some extent, already come to terms with it. Once the person has brought up the subject of death, it can be easier to talk about specific aspects of his or her death. Some terminally ill people want to know the facts about their condition, while others prefer to know as little as possible. Try to gauge how much the dying person wants to know.\n\nThe person's doctor, family, and friends need to be compassionate when talking about death because it is essential to maintain a degree of hope. This does not mean, however, that you should encourage false hopes of recovery, which could cause the person to lose confidence in his or her doctors or miss the opportunity to say good-bye to loved ones or put his or her affairs in order.\n\nSometimes a person who is terminally ill or his or her family members or friends may find it easier to talk about death with someone who is not emotionally involved in the situation. In such cases, it can be helpful to seek counseling from a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist or from a member of the clergy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Organ Donation]\nThe need for donated organs far surpasses the supply, and the waiting lists are long. But only a fraction of people who could donate organs actually do. The decision to donate vital organs after death for transplantation is a difficult one. Organ donation, however, ensures that the donor will make a lasting and meaningful gift that can help a critically ill person live a longer, healthier life.\n\nAgreeing to the surgical removal of one or more organs or parts of organs after death can be done by the dying person or his or her family members. Most organs are removed immediately after death. The heart, lungs, liver, pancreas, kidneys, eyes, and skin are some of the organs that can be successfully transplanted after death. A person may also want to donate his or her whole body for medical education or research.\n\nIf you decide to donate your organs or body after death, you must sign a donor card, which you can obtain from a local hospital, health department, library, driver's license facility, or an organization such as the Red Cross. Ask a family member to also sign the donor card. You should make your intentions about organ donation clear to your relatives and doctor because a signed donor card alone is not enough to guarantee that your wishes will be carried out. All states require the permission of a close family member after death (even if the deceased person has a signed donor card).\n\nThe acceptability of a body or organ can be determined only at the time of death. Older people may be able to donate only parts of their body (such as their eyes), but medical schools accept bodies of any age for research. To be a donor, the person has to be of sound mind and 18 years old or older, although, with parental consent, a person under 18 can be a donor. Donations are considered gifts; it is illegal to pay for a donated body or body part. However, transporting the body after death is the financial responsibility of the family or estate, whether the body is transported to a hospital or medical school for donation or to a funeral parlor.\n\nOrgan donation is performed with respect for the donor's body, using standard surgical practices. It does not violate the beliefs of most religions, or affect funeral practices, including the option of an open casket. And in the case of whole-body donation, not having the body at a memorial service can change the emphasis of the ceremony to the person's life (rather than his or her death).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Advance Directives]\nAt some", "response": {"entity_entity": [], "entity_event": [{"head": "person", "relation": "come to terms with", "tail": "[Event: death]"}, {"head": "family and friends", "relation": "prepare for", "tail": "[Event: death]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

This is especially true if the caregiving is not excessively demanding or complicated. For people who may require complex care, the family may still want to care for the person at home during the last few weeks of his or her life. In general, hospitals are better equipped to treat people who are acutely ill than people who are\n\nterminally ill. At home, a terminally ill person can remain more independent, participate in family life, and avoid feelings of loneliness and isolation.\n\nIf a family member plans to care for a terminally ill relative at home, regular visits from the doctor, along with support from other family members and friends, are essential. The family should consider using the services of visiting nurses if they are available in their community. Many hospitals offer palliative services that provide support for people who are caring for a terminally ill person at home.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Advance Directives > *Controlling Pain*]\nPain is the most feared symptom associated with terminal illness. Continuous pain over a long period can wear a person down emotionally and physically and undermine his or her ability to cope. Pain control, which is the responsibility of a person's doctor and caregivers, enhances the quality of the person's life during the terminal phase of an illness.\n\nAlthough some families express concern that a terminally ill person will become addicted to pain medication, drug addiction is not a realistic concern in the last few weeks of a person's life. Cutting back on pain medication can result in inadequate pain relief and needless suffering. Keeping a terminally ill person as pain-free as possible should be the major goal.\n\nDoctors often prescribe long-acting morphine to control the pain of a terminal illness such as cancer. If pain recurs between doses, the doctor may also prescribe a shorter-acting form of the drug or another pain reliever to use between doses of the longer-acting medication. If pain medication is prescribed on an as-needed basis, the medication should be given as soon as the person becomes uncomfortable. It is important to give pain medication on a regular basis to ensure continuous pain relief. Once pain begins to worsen, it is more difficult to control. To keep pain under control, medication is usually given around the clock, not just when a person asks for it. If the person is taking pain medication and is still in pain, talk to the doctor or the visiting nurse about adjusting the dosage.\n\nOther pain-relief methods (including relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, guided imagery, and massage) can be used along with medication to help control pain and improve a dying person's sense of well-being. In general, the earlier a person begins to use relaxation techniques and massage for pain relief, the more effective these methods are likely to be.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Process of Dying]\nThe term dying refers to the process in which the body's systems shut down and prepare for death. It is difficult to estimate how long the dying process will take. The actual moment of death is often very peaceful.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Process of Dying > *Nutrition and Elimination*]\nOne sign of dying is decreased food consumption and increased weight loss. If the person can (and wants to) eat, give him or her soft foods that won't cause choking. The person may not be hungry or thirsty and may gradually withdraw from food or may refuse to eat or drink. Moisten his or her mouth by giving ice chips to suck on or by wetting his or her mouth with a wet cloth. Don't force the person to eat or drink. Swallowing may be difficult. Urine output will start to decrease because the person is not drinking enough fluid, and he or she will have few bowel movements because of decreased food intake and movement. Keep the dying person clean and dry by using incontinence pads or disposable briefs and changing them when they are soiled.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Process of Dying > *Circulation*]\nCirculation will slow, and the person's pulse will grow weaker. The underside of the body may become darker in color as blood begins to pool. The person's arms and legs may be cold and look bluish purple. If the dying person feels chilled, keep him or her covered with blankets. (Don't use electric blankets because of the possibility of causing burns.) Keep the room comfortable and not too warm.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Process of Dying > *Agitation*]\nA person who is dying may become agitated, especially just before death. The agitation may be a sign not of pain but of discomfort. The person may become more and more restless. He or she may pull at the sheets, have trouble sleeping, continuously fidget, and even groan.

Some may, for a time, go on with their life as if nothing has happened, until they are eventually overcome by intense grief. Grief is an essential process that cannot be rushed.\n\nDuring the period immediately following a death, delusions of seeing the person are common. There is a tendency to forget that the person is dead and even act as if he or she were still alive. It is also common to idealize the dead person and feel guilty for not doing more for the person when he or she was alive. Guilt and intense grief occur frequently when a person has died unexpectedly. When death occurs after a long illness, the bereaved person has usually been able to anticipate the loss and may have been able to provide care, which can lessen feelings of guilt and grief. Also, it is normal for close friends or family members to feel relief once the death has occurred, especially if the death was a long, difficult, or painful one. This sense of relief is normal, and they should not feel guilty about it.\n\nThe intensity of grief lessens over time, although the amount of time varies from person to person and depends on the closeness of the relationship. Usually after about 6 weeks, grief will slowly be replaced by a more general lack of feeling or depression that will become much less intense after a year or so. By then, most bereaved people have recovered from their loss and have returned, more or less, to their previous life. However, feelings of grief may reappear at unpredictable times in the years that follow.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Mourning Process > *Coping With Grief*]\nSome people think that no one ever really gets over a death but that we just learn to adapt to the loss. If someone close to you has died, try to acknowledge the loss. Don't try to forget about the death or put it out of your mind. Talk about the dead person to relatives and friends. Express your feelings openly; cry if it helps.\n\nTo help yourself recover from the loss of someone close to you, try to meet new people and continue to engage in your favorite activities. Stay involved with groups or organizations that have been sources of support. Reading books about the grieving process may help you cope. For many people, sorting out the person's possessions can help them come to terms with the death. For others, the task is very painful and they delay it for as long as possible.\n\nGive yourself time to accept your loss, acknowledge your feelings of grief, and then begin to rebuild your life through positive interests and new relationships. You will begin to think less about your loss and focus more on happy memories of your loved one.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Physical Symptoms of Grief]\nPeople tend to forget that there is a physical side to grief as well as an emotional one. Some physical manifestations of grief can include insomnia or sleeping excessively, upset stomach or lost appetite, headache, fatigue, and muscle aches.\n\nLosing sleep and not exercising or eating properly can jeopardize your health. Try to get sufficient sleep and eat regular, nutritious meals. Don't use medication for depression or sleep loss unless it has been prescribed by your doctor, and never use drugs or alcohol to cope with the stress of losing a loved one. Exercise not only benefits your physical health but also helps relieve depression by releasing hormones called endorphins, which have a pain-relieving and soothing effect on the body.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Coping With the Death of a Child*]\nThe death of a child can cause more anger and grief than the death of an adult. We experience extreme distress, partly because we may feel that the child has not experienced enough of life. If the child died suddenly, it is often even more difficult to bear than if the death occurred after a long illness. Professional counseling is almost always necessary for parents, siblings, and other close relatives such as grandparents. Support groups or group therapy with other parents and children who have had similar experiences can be a great comfort.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Dying Child]\nA child may be able to face the prospect of his or her own death better than his or her parents can. A child may fear pain and, if admission to the hospital is necessary, separation from his or her parents more than he or she fears death. It will usually help a child come to terms with death if he or she is told about the illness. Death should not be treated as a forbidden subject. The most important thing that parents can give their child is security—physical security by their presence, and emotional security by their loving support.\n\nIt is important for a terminally ill child to lead as normal a life as possible for as long as possible.

The heart is a muscular pump about the size and shape of a fist. As it beats, the heart moves blood continuously around the body through the blood vessels. About once every minute, the heart pumps at least 9 pints of blood through the entire circulatory system.\n\nThe arteries carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the tissues. The main arteries branch into smaller arteries called arterioles, which branch to form tiny capillaries, the smallest blood vessels in the body. Capillary walls are only one cell thick, allowing oxygen and other vital nutrients in the blood to pass through the walls to nourish the tissues and allowing waste to be taken up by the capillaries for removal. The capillaries returning to the heart gradually become larger, forming tiny blood vessels called venules, which gradually become larger and form veins. The veins carry oxygen-depleted blood through organs such as the kidneys and liver, which remove waste, and through the lungs, which provide a fresh supply of oxygen. From the lungs, the veins carry the blood back to the heart, where the cycle of circulation begins again.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Heart and Circulation > Heart Disorders]\nTo function properly, your heart requires a constant supply of blood, which provides oxygen and other nutrients to the heart muscle. Three major coronary arteries and a network of smaller blood vessels on the surface of the heart supply blood to the heart muscle. The walls of healthy arteries are muscular, smooth, and elastic to allow blood to flow through them easily. Heart disease, also called coronary artery disease, develops when the coronary arteries become narrowed, reducing or blocking the flow of blood (and oxygen and other nutrients) to the heart. This narrowing of the arteries is usually caused by atherosclerosis, a gradual thickening and hardening of artery walls caused by buildup of a fatty substance called plaque. Over a\n\nlifetime, plaque can grow larger and the artery walls can become thicker, making the channel inside the artery narrower and potentially blocking blood flow.\n\nIn atherosclerosis, the heart has to pump harder and faster to push blood through the narrowed arteries, causing high blood pressure (see page 574). The reduced supply of oxygen to the heart muscle can cause pain in the chest called angina. In some people, the heart muscle is damaged and its pumping action weakened, causing heart failure (see page 570).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Heart and Blood Vessels > The Heart]\nThe heart is a muscular organ made up of two pumps, each divided into two sections that are linked by valves. The larger section is the left ventricle, which pumps oxygen-rich blood through the aorta to all parts of the body. The blood then returns to the heart, entering the right atrium through two large channels (superior vena cava and inferior vena cava). From the right atrium the blood passes through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. It is then pumped through the pulmonary artery into the lungs, where it eliminates carbon dioxide and takes up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood flows back to the left atrium of the heart through the pulmonary veins. From the left atrium it passes through the mitral valve into the left ventricle, where the cycle begins again.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Heart and Blood Vessels > Coronary arteries]\nOxygen-rich blood is pumped out of the aorta and flows into the coronary arteries, a branching network of blood vessels on the surface of the heart that supply oxygen- and nutrient-rich blood to the heart muscle.\n\nDiagram illustrating the major blood vessels and valves of the heart and their connections to the lungs and body.\n\n- **Aorta (sends oxygen-rich blood from heart to rest of body)**\n- **Superior vena cava (returns oxygen-depleted blood from head and upper body to heart)**\n- **Right atrium (receives oxygen-depleted blood from superior vena cava and inferior vena cava)**\n- **Tricuspid valve (allows oxygen-depleted blood to flow from right atrium to right ventricle)**\n- **Inferior vena cava (brings oxygen-depleted blood from lower body and legs to heart)**\n- **Pulmonary artery (carries oxygen-depleted blood from right ventricle to lungs)**\n- **Pulmonary valve (controls flow of oxygen-depleted blood from right ventricle into pulmonary artery)**\n- **Pulmonary veins (carry oxygen-rich blood from lungs to left atrium)**\n- **Left atrium (receives oxygen-rich blood from lungs through pulmonary veins)**\n- **Aortic valve (controls flow of oxygen-rich blood from left ventricle into aorta)**\n- **Mitral valve (allows oxygen-rich blood to flow from left atrium to left ventricle)**\n- **Left ventricle (pumps oxygen-rich blood from heart into aorta)**\n- **Right ventricle (pumps o", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "heart", "relation": "consists of", "tail": "circulatory system"}, {"head": "arteries", "relation": "carry", "tail": "oxygen-rich blood"}, {"head": "capillaries", "relation": "allow", "tail": "oxygen and nutrients"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "heart", "relation": "beats", "tail": "[Event: continuously around the body]"}, {"head": "arteries", "relation": "branch into", "tail": "[Event: smaller arteries called arterioles]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

The disease kills more women each year than all cancers combined and 10 times more women than breast cancer. A woman's risk increases sharply after menopause. Doctors call heart disease a lifestyle disease because it generally results from things we do to ourselves, such as getting too little exercise, eating too much and too many of the wrong kinds of foods (those high in fat and calories and low in nutrients) and too few of the right kinds of foods (those rich in antioxidants and fiber), and weighing more than we should. People who smoke increase their risk even more. Doctors believe that nearly all cases of heart disease could be eliminated if people adopted lifestyle measures such as exercising regularly, eating a nutritious diet, quitting smoking, and staying at a healthy weight.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Heart Disease > *Risk Factors*]\nA number of factors can increase your risk of heart disease. Although you cannot control risk factors such as age, gender, race, and family health history, you can control other risk factors by following a healthy lifestyle. Because heart disease often does not cause symptoms, especially in the early stages, many people who died of heart disease were not aware that they had it. The following factors can increase your risk of heart disease:\n\n- **Age** Your chances of developing heart disease increase with age. In men, the risk increases at age 45; in women, the risk increases at age 55.\n- **Gender** Men are generally at greater risk of developing heart disease than women up to age 55; a woman's risk increases significantly after menopause.\n- **Family history of heart disease** A family history of heart disease increases your risk, especially if your father or brother had heart disease before age 55, or your mother or sister had heart disease before age 65.\n- **High blood pressure** High blood pressure makes the heart pump harder, increasing both the size of the heart muscle and the chances of heart failure.\n\n- **High total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol** An excess of cholesterol in the blood, especially LDL (bad) cholesterol, leads to the formation of fatty deposits called plaque on artery walls (atherosclerosis). Plaque can rupture, producing blood clots that can block the flow of blood, causing a heart attack or stroke.\n- **Low HDL cholesterol** HDL (good) cholesterol removes harmful LDL cholesterol from the blood, reducing plaque buildup in artery walls.\n- **High C-reactive protein levels** Inflammation (which contributes to atherosclerosis) leaves a chemical by-product in the blood called C-reactive protein (CRP); the higher a person's CRP level, the greater his or her risk of a heart attack or stroke.\n- **Smoking** Smoking raises blood pressure. Free radicals from cigarette smoke damage LDL cholesterol, making it more likely to collect as plaque on artery walls. Also, toxic chemicals in smoke damage arteries directly.\n- **Diabetes** Most people who have diabetes die of some form of blood vessel disease or heart disease.\n- **Race** Blacks have a higher risk of heart disease than people of other races.\n- **Being overweight** Being overweight makes the heart work harder, increases the chances of developing high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, and worsens blood cholesterol levels.\n- **Lack of exercise** An inactive lifestyle leads to weight gain, obesity, high cholesterol levels, and type 2 diabetes.\n- **Stress** Although the precise mechanism is unclear, in some people unmanaged stress can lead to heart disease.\n- **High homocysteine levels** Too much of a body chemical called homocysteine in the blood may damage artery walls and promote formation of blood clots, significantly increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke. Taking 400 micrograms of the B vitamin folic acid every day can help keep homocysteine at a healthy level.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Warning Signs of Heart Disease]\nThe main symptom of heart disease is temporary mild to severe chest pain (angina). See your doctor as soon as possible if you have any of the following symptoms:\n\n- Pain or pressure in the chest while resting\n- Pain or pressure in the chest during physical activity (such as climbing stairs or running)\n\n- Shortness of breath during physical activity\n- Chest pain that stops after a brief rest\n- Dizziness, nausea, sweating, or difficulty breathing\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nHeart disease often does not produce symptoms, and for some people the first sign of heart disease is a heart attack. Others, however, may experience angina, a type of chest pain that results from an inadequate supply of oxygen to the heart muscle. Healthy coronary arteries can easily supply the heart with as much oxygen as it needs. Arteries that have been narrowed or damaged by atherosclerosis cannot provide sufficient oxygen, especially during times of increased demand, such as when a perso", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "heart disease", "relation": "causes by", "tail": "getting too little exercise"}, {"head": "heart disease", "relation": "causes by", "tail": "eating too much and too many of the wrong kinds of foods"}, {"head": "heart disease", "relation": "causes by", "tail": "weighing more than we should"}, {"head": "heart disease", "relation": "increases risk", "tail": "smoking"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctors", "relation": "believe", "tail": "[Event: nearly all cases of heart disease could be eliminated]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

While you walk or run on a treadmill or ride a stationary bicycle, the doctor injects a small amount of a radioactive substance called thallium into your bloodstream, which carries it to the coronary arteries and heart muscle. After exercising, you lie on an examining table and the doctor uses a scanner called a gamma camera to produce images of blood flow through the coronary arteries to the heart. The doctor performs a second scan a few hours later while you are resting. The test shows if blood flow through the coronary arteries is normal during both exercise and rest and if the arteries are narrowed or blocked. Absence of thallium in part of the heart muscle is a sign of damage (dead heart muscle tissue) from a previous heart attack.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Exercise stress test > Echocardiogram]\nAn echocardiogram is a procedure in which images are obtained by bouncing ultrasound waves off the heart. In this test, the technician places a handheld ultrasound transducer (a device that transmits sound waves that are converted to images on a video\n\nmonitor) on the left side of your chest, below the rib cage. The image on the monitor shows the size of your heart, movement of the heart muscle, blood flow through the heart valves, and valve function. If you have ischemia, the pumping motion of the wall of the left ventricle appears abnormal on the echocardiogram. An echocardiogram can be performed while you are at rest or while you walk or run on a treadmill or ride a stationary bicycle.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Coronary angiogram]\nA coronary angiogram (also called an arteriogram or cardiac catheterization) allows doctors to examine the coronary arteries on film. A catheter (a thin, flexible tube) is usually inserted into the femoral artery (a large blood vessel in the groin area) and moved up through the aorta (the main artery in the body) into the coronary arteries. A contrast medium (dye) is injected through the catheter into the artery under examination, and rapid-sequence X-rays (like a movie) are taken of the artery. Narrowing and blood flow inside the arteries are clearly visible, allowing the doctor to determine if the arteries can be treated with bypass surgery or angioplasty. Occasionally, an angiogram is performed to detect spasms in coronary arteries that do not have any plaque (hardened fatty deposits in artery walls). In this case, medication is given to stimulate a spasm during the procedure to help diagnose heart disease.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Echocardiogram]\n![Diagram illustrating an echocardiogram procedure. A patient is lying down, and a healthcare provider is operating a machine labeled 'Ultrasound monitor' and 'Transducer'.

Detectors inside the scanning ring send signals to a computer, which constructs cross-sectional X-ray images of the heart and coronary arteries. This test detects calcium deposits in the arteries resulting from atherosclerosis. A faster version of CT scanning (called ultrafast CT or electron beam CT) is used to predict heart attack risk in people who have no symptoms of heart disease.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > IMT]\nIMT (intimal-medial thickness) uses ultrasound (see page 111) to measure the thickness of the carotid arteries and to determine the extent of atherosclerosis. An increase in the thickness of the carotid arteries indicates an increased risk of developing heart disease. This test can detect heart disease before the arteries are significantly narrowed.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > ABI]\nABI (ankle-brachial index) uses Doppler ultrasound (see page 111) and standard blood pressure cuffs to detect narrowing of the arteries, a strong sign of heart disease. ABI compares the systolic (the first, or upper, number in a blood pressure reading) blood pressure in the ankle to the systolic blood pressure in the arm. A low ratio (less than 0.9) is an indication of heart disease.

You may need to take this medication for the rest of your life. Cholesterol-lowering medications include the following:\n\n**Statins** Statin drugs (HMG CoA reductase inhibitors) block the action of an enzyme called HMG CoA reductase in the liver, causing the liver to produce less cholesterol. Possible side effects include occasional muscle aches and nausea. In rare cases, liver damage may result. Currently available statin drugs include lovastatin, simvastatin, provastatin, fluvastatin, and atorvastatin.\n\n**Bile acid binding resins** Bile acid binding resins prevent absorption of cholesterol into the blood and stimulate the liver to remove cholesterol from the bloodstream. Possible side effects include bloating, cramping, and diarrhea. Examples of bile acid binding resins include cholestyramine, colestipol, and colesevelam.\n\n**Fibrates** Fibrates (also called fibric acid derivatives) decrease blood levels of triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood). These drugs can also decrease LDL (bad) cholesterol and mildly increase HDL (good) cholesterol. People who take fibrates have a slightly increased risk of developing gallstones (see page 793) and gallbladder disease. Examples include clofibrate, fenofibrate, and gemfibrozil.\n\n**Niacin** Niacin (nicotinic acid) is a vitamin that decreases production of LDL (bad) cholesterol in the liver. Depending on the dosage, it can also increase HDL (good)\n\ncholesterol. Possible side effects include bloating, cramping, or diarrhea. In rare cases, niacin may cause liver damage. A number of nonprescription niacin supplements are available over the counter.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Surgery for heart disease]\nA number of surgical procedures can be performed to treat heart disease, primarily by rerouting blood vessels around a blockage or reopening a blocked artery. These procedures include coronary artery bypass surgery, balloon angioplasty, and stent placement.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Surgery for heart disease > *Coronary artery bypass surgery*]\nCoronary artery bypass surgery is very effective for people who have angina and whose heart muscle has not been damaged by a heart attack. Bypass surgery is the procedure most widely used to treat heart disease caused by atherosclerosis (see page 557). The procedure can improve endurance, reduce symptoms, and decrease the amount of medication a person needs to take. Bypass surgery is most likely to benefit people who have severe angina that cannot be controlled with medication, who have a normally functioning heart, and who have not had a heart attack. About 85 percent of people who have bypass surgery experience complete or significant relief from their symptoms.\n\nBypass surgery involves grafting veins or arteries from another part of the body onto the coronary artery to reroute blood flow around the obstruction. The surgeon usually uses veins from the person's leg. Most surgeons also use at least one artery, usually taken from the person's chest wall. Atherosclerosis seldom develops in the treated arteries, and most treated arteries stay open for at least 10 years after the surgery. However, if the grafted veins become obstructed, the procedure may need to be repeated.\n\nFor bypass surgery you are given general anesthesia, your heart is stopped, and you are placed on a heart-lung machine, which takes over your circulation and breathing. The machine oxygenates your blood and pumps it throughout your body. If necessary, more than one bypass can be performed during the same procedure.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Surgery for heart disease > *Coronary artery bypass surgery*]\nThis illustration shows blood vessels that were taken from other parts of the body and grafted onto the right and left coronary arteries to allow blood flow to bypass two blockages.\n\n![Diagram of the human heart showing a blockage in the left coronary artery and a bypass graft connecting the right coronary artery to the left coronary artery, bypassing the blockage.]()![](_page_1020_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nA day or two after surgery, you will probably begin a cardiac rehabilitation program to help you recondition your heart, lungs, and muscles, and control your cholesterol levels. The rehabilitation program usually includes eating a low-fat diet, exercising regularly, and having lifestyle counseling designed to help you keep your heart healthy and prevent future blockages in your arteries.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Surgery for heart disease > *Coronary angioplasty and other procedures to open arteries*]\nDoctors perform a number of procedures to open narrowed or blocked arteries.

A heart attack occurs when a coronary artery is blocked, depriving part of the heart muscle of blood. The resulting damage to the heart muscle is the most common cause of death in people who have heart disease.\n\nA blocked coronary artery usually results from long-term atherosclerosis (see page 557), a condition in which arteries are narrowed by hardened fatty deposits called plaque. Most heart attacks occur when a plaque ruptures and a blood clot forms on the rough surface of the ruptured plaque and blocks blood flow through the artery suddenly and completely. In rare cases, a heart attack can result when a blood clot from another area of the heart breaks loose and blocks a coronary artery. Another rare cause of a heart attack is a spasm in a coronary artery that stops blood flow to the heart muscle. Using a stimulant drug such as cocaine can trigger this type of spasm.\n\nOnce a coronary artery has been blocked, damage to the heart muscle occurs quickly and can become permanent within minutes. In general, the longer the blockage lasts, the\n\nmore extensive the damage to the heart muscle. Immediate medical treatment is essential to limit damage to the heart muscle and increase a person's chances of survival.\n\nIn some cases after a heart attack, a blood clot may form inside one of the four chambers of the heart. If the clot breaks loose, it can travel through the bloodstream and cause damage to tissues elsewhere in the body. For example, if the clot blocks an artery that supplies blood to the brain, the result is a stroke (see page 669). Sometimes damage caused by a heart attack weakens and stretches one of the walls of the heart chambers, causing a bulge in the wall called an aneurysm (see page 599). An aneurysm can grow and burst without warning, causing uncontrolled bleeding (hemorrhage). Inactivity during bed rest may cause blood clots to form in the veins of the legs (deep vein thrombosis; see page 605). These clots can break off, travel through the bloodstream, and block an artery that supplies blood to the lungs (pulmonary embolism; see page 606).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Heart Attack > Heart attack]\nA blood clot is more likely to block an artery if the artery walls have been narrowed by a buildup of plaque. A blood clot in a coronary artery—a condition called coronary thrombosis—can block blood flow to the heart muscle and cause a heart attack. The area of the heart muscle normally supplied by the artery becomes damaged.\n\n![Diagram of the human heart showing a blockage in a coronary artery, resulting in damage to the heart muscle.]()Diagram of the human heart illustrating a heart attack. The image shows a cross-section of the heart. A label points to the area of the heart muscle supplied by the artery, indicating it is the \"Damaged area of heart muscle\".

While some of these can't be changed—such as family health history, race, and gender—others can be modified or eliminated through lifestyle changes.\n\n- **Family health history** If siblings, parents, or grandparents had heart attacks at an early age, you are also at risk.\n- **Gender** Men are at greater risk of having a heart attack than women before age 55. After menopause, a woman's risk is the same as a man's.\n- **Undesirable cholesterol profile** An unhealthy cholesterol profile (see page 146) promotes atherosclerosis, which increases your risk of having a heart attack.\n- **High blood pressure** Uncontrolled high blood pressure promotes atherosclerosis (see page 557).\n- **Smoking** Smoking (including exposure to secondhand smoke) raises blood pressure, damages artery walls, and increases the risk of blood clot formation.\n- **Diabetes** Uncontrolled diabetes promotes atherosclerosis and increases blood levels of LDL (harmful) cholesterol.\n- **Race** Blacks are at greater risk of having a heart attack than people of other races.\n- **Lack of exercise** A sedentary lifestyle often results in weight gain and a poor cholesterol profile.\n- **Being overweight** Weighing more than your ideal body weight (see page 51) increases your risk for high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes.\n- **Alcohol consumption** Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can lead to high blood pressure and can raise blood levels of triglycerides (a potentially harmful type of fat in the blood).\n- **Stress** In some people, long-term stress can contribute to high blood pressure.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nSymptoms of a heart attack vary in type and intensity from one pers", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "coronary artery", "relation": "is blocked by", "tail": "atherosclerosis"}, {"head": "plaque", "relation": "ruptures and causes a blood clot", "tail": "heart attack"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "patient", "relation": "experiences", "tail": "[Event: heart attack]"}, {"head": "atherosclerosis", "relation": "results in", "tail": "[Event: blocked coronary artery]"}, {"head": "plaque rupture", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: blood clot formation]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: plaque rupture]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: heart attack]"}, {"head": "[Event: atherosclerosis]", "relation": "results in", "tail": "[Event: blocked coronary artery]"}]}, "status": "success"}

If you have symptoms of a heart attack, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. The sooner treatment begins, the greater your chances of survival, so act quickly, even if you are not sure you are having a heart attack. The most common symptoms of a heart attack include:\n\n- Sudden squeezing pain or a feeling of tightness, pressure, or fullness in the center of the chest that lasts for more than several minutes\n\n- Chest pain that extends to the shoulders, arms, back, neck, or jaw\n- Indigestion or persistent pain in the upper abdomen\n- Shortness of breath\n- Dizziness or fainting\n- Weakness or fatigue\n- Heavy sweating\n- Chills\n- Nausea and vomiting\n- Backache\n- Arm or jaw numbness\n- Restlessness or anxiety; sleeplessness\n- Paleness\n- Blueness of the lips, hands, or feet\n\nWhile waiting for emergency help to arrive, take an aspirin tablet; aspirin reduces blood clotting and helps limit damage to the heart muscle, improving your chances of survival. Keep warm and calm. If you are with a person who is having a heart attack and he or she loses consciousness, use a portable defibrillator (see page 581), if one is available, to restart the heart. Or perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR; see previous page) if you have been trained in this lifesaving technique.\n\nAnother heart muscle enzyme, called CK-MB, is also released into the blood after a heart attack. Elevated CK-MB levels appear within 6 hours of a heart attack and last for 36 to 48 hours. CK-MB levels usually are measured soon after a person is admitted to the hospital and at 6- to 8-hour intervals over the next 24 hours.\n\nIf you have had or are having a heart attack, treatment will begin immediately. The doctor may order additional tests, such as a chest X-ray (see page 109), an echocardiogram (see page 561), a radionuclide scan (see page 114), or a coronary angiogram (see page 561). A chest X-ray allows the doctor to evaluate the size and shape of your heart and coronary arteries. An echocardiogram may show damage to the left ventricle (the pumping chamber of the heart). A radionuclide scan may show reduced blood flow to a specific area of the heart that has been damaged by a heart attack. A coronary angiogram can show if the arteries that supply blood to the heart are narrowed or blocked.\n\nBefore you leave the hospital, you will probably have tests to evaluate the extent of any underlying heart disease. These tests—an ECG and, perhaps, a coronary angiogram or an echocardiogram—will help the doctor accurately determine the extent of the\n\ndamage to the heart muscle and whether any narrowed or blocked sections in the coronary arteries might need to be opened with surgery. The severity of the disease will determine if surgery is necessary.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe sooner treatment for a heart attack begins, the better your chances of survival. Treatment may include medication, surgery, or both, depending on your overall health and the amount of damage to the heart muscle.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > **Medication**]\nYou may be given nitroglycerin to improve blood flow to and from your heart and to relieve pain. If your pain is severe, you may be given a strong pain reliever such as morphine. You will probably be given antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin) or anticoagulant drugs (such as heparin) to help prevent blood clots from forming again in the coronary arteries or new clots from forming in the veins, especially in the legs (see page 605). Beta blockers (see page 562) may be given to help reduce the heart's workload by slowing the heartbeat and lowering blood pressure.\n\nYou may be given thrombolytic (clot-dissolving) drugs (see page 563) to dissolve the blood clot that is blocking the coronary artery. However, this treatment is effective only if no more than 6 hours have passed since the onset of symptoms. In most cases, thrombolytic drugs are given (usually by injection directly into a vein) as soon as the diagnosis of a heart attack is confirmed.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > **Surgery**]\nYou will have additional tests, such as a coronary angiogram (see page 561), to determine whether the clot has dissolved and blood flow has been restored. If the tests show that the coronary artery is still blocked, a procedure such as angioplasty (see page 565) may be performed to reopen the artery. If the artery becomes blocked again after surgery, the procedure may be repeated a few days later.\n\nAs an alternative to treatment with a thrombolytic drug, your doctor may perform immediate angioplasty of the blocked blood vessel using specially designed instruments to remove the blood clot from the artery. Balloons and stents may be used to open the artery. In many cases, immediate angioplasty for a heart attack can be as effective as treatment with thrombolytic drugs in limiting the dama", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "heart attack", "relation": "treats", "tail": "survival"}, {"head": "symptoms of a heart attack", "relation": "include", "tail": "chest pain"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "you", "relation": "call", "tail": "[Event: 911 or your local emergency number]"}, {"head": "treatment", "relation": "begins", "tail": "[Event: immediately]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

The main symptom of heart failure is shortness of breath as a result of lung congestion. You may become short of breath while active or while resting. You may have difficulty breathing when you lie down, and your breathing problems may become severe enough to disturb your sleep. At times you may wake up gasping for air. Although episodes of severe shortness of breath usually last less than an hour, the experience can be frightening.\n\nYour lungs may become so swollen and congested that your breathing may be raspy or you may wheeze. You may also have chest pain and a persistent cough that produces frothy, blood-flecked phlegm. The fluid in your lungs decreases your resistance to infection; pneumonia (see page 660), for example, is a frequent complication of heart failure.\n\nFatigue is another common symptom of heart failure. Because your body tissues are not receiving enough oxygen and nutrients, you may feel weak or tire easily. Fluid accumulation may cause the lowest part of your body to swell. For example, if you are confined to bed, the lower part of your back may become swollen. If you are standing, your legs, ankles, or feet may become swollen. Your liver may also become swollen, causing abdominal pain.\n\nOther possible symptoms of congestive heart failure include low blood pressure, dizziness, and confusion. You also may lose your appetite but experience rapid weight gain from the accumulation of fluid.\n\nFor some people, symptoms may not develop until the condition is at an advanced stage. The heart muscle attempts to compensate for its decreased pumping ability by growing larger and thicker and contracting more often. However, the effects of this adjustment are only temporary, and symptoms develop eventually.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nDiagnosis of heart failure is based on your symptoms and risk factors and a physical examination. The doctor will listen for lung congestion and abnormal heart sounds with a stethoscope. He or she may order a chest X-ray to look for lung congestion and check the size and shape of your heart. The doctor may order an echocardiogram (see page 561) to examine the heart valves and determine how much blood the heart pumps out when it contracts, and an electrocardiogram (ECG; see page 559) to determine how well the heart is functioning. He or she may also recommend a coronary angiogram (see page 561) to evaluate the condition of the coronary arteries. The doctor may order additional tests to rule out possible causes of your symptoms other than heart disease, such as anemia (see page 610) or an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism; see page 901).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTreatment of congestive heart failure focuses on the underlying disease or condition that is causing it. Your doctor will recommend lifestyle changes you will need to make to improve the quality of your life and control your risk factors for heart disease. For example, if you smoke, your doctor will recommend that you quit smoking. He or she also will recommend that you lose weight if necessary and reduce the amount of fat in your diet. Your doctor also may recommend reducing your intake of caffeine and sodium and eating smaller, more frequent meals, which can help keep you from overeating and can improve your body's absorption of nutrients. Caffeine can temporarily raise blood pressure and heart rate. For some people, consuming large amounts of sodium (more than 2,400 milligrams a day) can lead to fluid retention, which can increase blood pressure. If you have severe heart failure, you may need to limit your fluid intake to avoid fluid retention. Your doctor will probably recommend that you begin a program of regular, moderate exercise under his or her supervision.\n\nYour doctor is likely to prescribe medication to help relieve your symptoms. Diuretic drugs will help your body eliminate excess fluid and sodium, thereby decreasing blood volume and lowering your blood pressure. Because diuretic drugs increase the body's output of urine, always take them in the morning to avoid having to get up during the night to urinate.\n\nOther medications frequently prescribed to treat heart failure include digitalis drugs (usually digoxin) and vasodilators such as ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors. Digitalis drugs slow the heart rate while increasing the strength of the\n\nheartbeat and the heart's output of blood. ACE inhibitors widen both small arteries and veins and counteract some of the substances produced by the kidneys that can narrow small arteries and cause the body to retain fluid. ACE inhibitors reduce the heart's workload and significantly prolong life in many people. They are powerful drugs, and you and your doctor may need to work together to find the appropriate dosage for you. If you cannot take ACE inhibitors, your doctor may prescribe a nitrate drug or hydralazine, both of whic", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "heart failure", "relation": "usually develops from", "tail": "lung congestion"}, {"head": "shortness of breath", "relation": "as a result of", "tail": "lung congestion"}, {"head": "chest pain", "relation": "may have", "tail": "heart failure"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "you may become short of breath", "relation": "while active or while resting", "tail": "[Event: experiencing symptoms]"}, {"head": "your breathing problems may become severe enough to disturb your sleep", "relation": "as a result of", "tail": "[Event: experiencing symptoms]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: episodes of severe shortness of breath]", "relation": "usually last less than an hour", "tail": "[Event: frightening experience]"}, {"head": "[Event: lung congestion]", "relation": "may become so swollen and congested that your breathing may be raspy or you may wheeze", "tail": "[Event: experiencing symptoms]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Labels include: Connection to aorta, Superior vena cava, Connection to pulmonary artery, Donor heart, and Inferior vena cava.\n\n![](_page_1037_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Heart transplant > Heart transplants]\nThe first human heart transplant was performed in 1967. Since that time, the procedure has become an established treatment for advanced heart disease. Surgeons perform nearly 2,300 heart transplants nationwide each year. Doctors usually recommend a heart transplant only when a person has irreversible, long-term heart failure that cannot be controlled with other medical or surgical treatments. (The artificial hearts now available are still experimental and cannot offer a reliable, long-term solution to the problem of a diseased heart.) Heart transplants can be performed at any age, including infancy and childhood, but the procedure is usually not recommended for people over age 65. The most common causes of heart failure are:\n\n- Coronary artery disease (blockage in the arteries leading to the heart)\n- Cardiomyopathy (weakness of the heart muscle, affecting its ability to pump blood)\n\n- Heart disease that is present at birth\n- Damage to the heart muscle or valves\n- Failure of an earlier transplant\n\nAfter surgery, early symptoms of rejection (see page 821) of the donor heart are not always apparent, so doctors must regularly take tiny samples of the heart muscle and examine them under a microscope (a procedure called a biopsy) to check for signs of rejection. To obtain samples of the tissue, a doctor inserts a small tube into an incision in the neck, down the jugular vein, and into the heart. If the doctor finds signs of rejection, he or she will give the person higher doses of immune-suppressing drugs.\n\nAfter the person goes home from the hospital for recovery, he or she will have to visit the doctor for regular follow-up visits and more biopsies. Some of the early complications (in addition to rejection) that can arise after heart transplant surgery include kidney failure (which is usually temporary), wound infection, pneumonia, and stroke. Irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (see page 580) sometimes occur.\n\nHeart transplants now have a high success rate: about 85 percent of those who receive a new heart are alive after 1 year, 79 percent after 3 years, and 74 percent after 5 years. These survival rates continue to improve. Without this lifesaving procedure, the vast majority of heart transplant recipients would have died within 2 years.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > High Blood Pressure]\nBlood pressure is produced by the heart as it pumps blood through the arteries and as the arteries resist blood flow. It is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) with an instrument called a sphygmomanometer. Blood pressure is highest when the heart contracts (beats) and pumps blood into the arteries. This is the systolic pressure. Between beats, when the heart is resting, the pressure falls. This is the diastolic pressure. A blood pressure reading is given as a combination of these two pressures; the systolic pressure is written above or before the diastolic pressure. For example, if your blood pressure reading is 130 over 80, it is written as 130/80 mm Hg; 130 is the systolic pressure and 80 is the diastolic pressure.\n\nIn healthy people, blood pressure varies throughout the day, depending on factors such as physical activity and stress. In people who have high blood pressure, the heart always pumps with greater force than necessary, regardless of other factors, and blood pressure is never within the normal range. The medical term for high blood pressure is hypertension.\n\nHigh blood pressure is a very common condition, affecting about 50 million adults in the United States. Because it seldom causes symptoms, many people who have high blood pressure do not know that they have it. However, in most cases, high blood pressure is easy for doctors to detect and treat.\n\nThe cause of high blood pressure is usually unknown. This is called primary or essential hypertension. Most people who have high blood pressure have essential hypertension. Although essential hypertension can't be cured, it can be controlled. Hypertension that results from an underlying disease or condition—such as long-term kidney disease, thyroid disease, adrenal gland abnormalities, or use of illicit drugs—is called secondary hypertension. Secondary hypertension can be cured by successfully treating the underlying disease or condition.\n\nIn most people who have hypertension, blood pressure continues to rise over time unless it is treated. Sometimes, however, significantly high blood pressure develops very quickly. This life-threatening condition, which can result from either essential hypertension or secondary hypertension, is called malignant hypertension.

When you visit your doctor, he or she will take a health history (see page 130), perform a physical examination, and measure your blood pressure. Because factors such as physical activity or stress can cause a temporary increase in blood pressure, your doctor will need to take a number of blood pressure readings over a period of several weeks or months to determine whether you have high blood pressure. If your blood pressure readings are occasionally above normal, your doctor may recommend that you monitor\n\nyour blood pressure at home. If your blood pressure readings are consistently above normal, you have high blood pressure.\n\nThe doctor will probably examine your eyes with a viewing instrument called an ophthalmoscope. The condition of the blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive membrane that lines the back of the eyes) can provide valuable information about the extent of damage caused by high blood pressure.\n\nYour doctor may perform additional tests to determine if you have essential hypertension or secondary hypertension. He or she may perform a chest X-ray (see page 109), an echocardiogram (see page 561), and an electrocardiogram (ECG; see page 559) to see if your heart is enlarged. The ECG will also reveal any previous damage to the heart muscle, such as damage caused by a heart attack. You will have blood and urine tests to determine if your kidneys are functioning properly. Some people may also need to have intravenous urography, a test in which the doctor injects a harmless dye into an artery and examines the kidneys on an X-ray image. Other people may have tests to evaluate blood flow, such as a CT scan (see page 562), an MRI (see page 113), a radionuclide scan (see page 114), or a coronary angiogram (see page 561).\n\nA blood pressure reading of less than 120/80 mm Hg is generally considered normal. A category called prehypertension—120-139/80-89—indicates that a person is at risk of eventually developing high blood pressure. Blood pressure is classified according to increasing level of health risk, as reflected in the guidelines on the next page.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nWhen the underlying cause of secondary hypertension is treated successfully, blood pressure usually returns to normal levels. However, if the underlying cause cannot be cured, treatment is usually the same as that for essential hypertension.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > **Lifestyle changes**]\nFor many people, lifestyle changes such as giving up tobacco, following a healthy diet, exercising regularly, losing weight, and managing stress not only decrease the risk of developing high blood pressure but also significantly reduce existing high blood pressure. However, if lifestyle changes do not lower blood pressure to within the normal range, the doctor will probably recommend treatment with antihypertensive drugs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > **Medication**]\nDoctors usually prescribe antihypertensive medication when high blood pressure cannot be controlled with lifestyle changes. Most people who take antihypertensive medication need to take it for the rest of their life.\n\nThe following list provides a brief description of the most frequently prescribed types of antihypertensive medications. (For additional information about these medications, see page 562.)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > Blood Pressure Classifications for People Age 18 or Older]\n| Category              | Systolic             | Diastolic           |\n|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Normal blood pressure | Lower than 120 mm Hg | Lower than 80 mm Hg |\n| Prehypertension       | 120 to 139 mm Hg     | 80 to 89 mm Hg      |\n| Stage 1 hypertension  | 140 to 159 mm Hg     | 90 to 99 mm Hg      |\n| Stage 2 hypertension  | 160 mm Hg or higher  | 100 mm Hg or higher |\n\nA diagnosis of hypertension is based on two or more blood pressure readings taken at separate visits to the doctor's office or clinic. If your systolic pressure falls into one category and your diastolic pressure into another, the higher reading is used to classify your blood pressure.\n\n- **Diuretics** Diuretics increase the kidneys' excretion of water and sodium, reducing the volume of blood the heart has to pump, thereby reducing blood pressure.\n- **Beta blockers** Beta blockers slow the heart rate and block the output of an enzyme that raises blood pressure.\n- **Alpha blockers** Alpha blockers prevent arteries from constricting and block the effects of the stress hormone epinephrine, which raises blood pressure.\n- **ACE inhibitors** ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors block production of an enzyme (ACE) that causes blood vessels to constrict.\n- **Angiotensin-receptor blockers** Angiotensin-receptor blockers prevent the arteries from constricting and prevent the kidneys from retaining sodium and\n\nwater, wh", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "will", "tail": "take"}, {"head": "blood pressure readings", "relation": "are", "tail": "above normal"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "perform", "tail": "[Event: physical examination]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "take", "tail": "[Event: health history]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "visit", "tail": "[Event: routine checkup]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: temporary increase in blood pressure]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: need to take multiple readings]"}, {"head": "[Event: high blood pressure is detected]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: doctor recommends monitoring at home]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Regular exercise helps you condition your heart and lungs, improve your strength and endurance, and maintain a healthy weight.\n\n![Illustration of a man performing step aerobics, stepping up and down on a platform while holding a dumbbell.]()![](_page_1047_Picture_5.jpeg)\n\n**Cut down on salt.** Most Americans take in more sodium than they need. Excess salt causes your body to retain water, which raises blood volume and therefore blood pressure. If you are salt-sensitive, which means that your blood pressure rises when you eat salt, eating less salt—no more than 1 teaspoon per day—will benefit your health.\n\n**Limit alcohol.** Drinking too much alcohol will raise your blood pressure temporarily and, over time, may also lead to high blood pressure. Limit yourself to one drink a day if you are a woman or two drinks a day if you are a man. A drink is defined as 1½ ounces of 80-proof liquor, 5 ounces of wine, or 12 ounces of beer.\n\n**Do not use tobacco.** Smoking puts you at risk of developing high blood pressure or having a heart attack or stroke. Smoking also worsens a person's cholesterol profile, which is a factor in heart disease. Chemicals in smokeless tobacco can also raise blood pressure. (For helpful tips on how to quit smoking, see page 29.)\n\nOther factors that may help prevent high blood pressure in some people include:\n\n**Potassium** Having an adequate level of potassium in the body may help prevent high blood pressure by balancing the amount of sodium in the body. Good sources of potassium include fresh fruits and vegetables (especially bananas, oranges, melons, and potatoes), low-fat or fat-free dairy products, and fish. Do not take potassium supplements unless your doctor recommends them. Too much potassium can cause an irregular heartbeat.\n\n**Calcium** Too little calcium in the diet may lead to high blood pressure (as well as weak bones). You can get the calcium you need—1,200 to 1,500 milligrams per day for adults—from low-fat and fat-free dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cheese, and green leafy vegetables. Doctors do not recommend taking calcium supplements to help prevent high blood pressure.\n\n**Magnesium** A diet low in magnesium may increase blood pressure. The best sources of magnesium are whole grains, green leafy vegetables, seeds, nuts, and dried peas and beans.

She did it by losing only 10 pounds and exercising more. How can that be?\n\n**A.** Even a weight loss of as few as 10 pounds can help lower blood pressure. Exercise is also a proven blood-pressure reducer. As long as your friend keeps her weight at a healthy level by eating a nutritious, low-fat diet rich in fruits and vegetables and by exercising regularly, she should be able to continue to control her blood pressure without medication. However, she needs to continue to have her blood pressure measured to make sure it is staying at a healthy level.\n\n**Q.** *Why is it taking so long to find the right combination of medications to control my high blood pressure?*\n\n**A.** Blood pressure is a highly complex biochemical process that is influenced by many different factors. Because your body is a unique biological system, it will not respond in exactly the same way to a particular medication as another person's system will. An antihypertensive medication or combination of medications that works for one person may not work for another. Until drugs are developed that can be tailored to our unique genetic makeup, finding the right medication will continue to be a matter of trial and error. I'm sure your doctor will soon find a medication that is effective for you.\n\n- **Fish oils** Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of fat found in fatty fish such as mackerel and salmon. These oils help protect the lining of arteries, prevent irregular heart rhythms, and reduce the formation of blood clots. Eating fish two or more times a week can also help reduce high blood pressure and improve your cholesterol profile.\n- **Fat and cholesterol** To help prevent heart disease, limit the amount of fat in your diet, especially the saturated fat found in foods such as fatty meats and full-fat dairy products. Too much saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol level, which increases your risk of developing heart disease. High-fat foods are usually high in calories.\n- **Caffeine** Although caffeine in coffee, tea, and soft drinks may raise blood pressure temporarily in some people, it quickly returns to its usual level. Limit your caffeine intake if your doctor recommends it.\n- **Stress management** Stress can raise blood pressure temporarily and can aggravate existing high blood pressure, making it more difficult to control. Although stress management techniques—such as biofeedback, meditation, or relaxation training—do not help prevent high blood pressure, they may help you deal positively with the stress in your life. Getting enough sleep can also be helpful.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Shock]\nShock is a life-threatening condition in which blood flow throughout the body suddenly becomes inadequate or is blocked, depriving body tissues of oxygen and other vital nutrients. Shock is usually caused by extremely low blood pressure, which prevents the heart muscle from pumping an adequate supply of blood to the tissues. If not treated quickly, shock can be fatal.\n\nVery low blood pressure can result from conditions—such as a heart attack or arrhythmia—that interfere with the ability of the left ventricle of the heart to pump effectively. Another possible cause of extremely low blood pressure is severe blood loss resulting from an injury or from a disorder that causes internal bleeding, such as a perforated peptic ulcer (see page 755) or a ruptured aneurysm (see page 599). Tissue damage from a severe burn or severe dehydration caused by persistent vomiting, diarrhea, or inadequate fluid intake can decrease blood volume, resulting in very low blood pressure. Sometimes toxins from a severe infection get into the bloodstream and cause shock. Shock can also develop when a severe allergic reaction causes blood vessels to dilate (widen) and leak fluid, decreasing blood volume.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Shock > WARNING! > Shock]\nShock is a medical emergency. Symptoms of shock are very low blood pressure combined with sweating, faintness, nausea, shallow breathing, rapid pulse, or pale, cold, clammy skin. Reduced blood flow to the kidneys causes urine production to stop. Inadequate blood supply to the brain leads to drowsiness, confusion, and loss of consciousness.\n\nIf you are with someone who has symptoms of shock, call 911 or your local emergency number, or take the person to the nearest hospital emergency department immediately. (For information on what to do while waiting for emergency help to arrive, see page 162.)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Heart Rate and Rhythm Disorders]\nThe heart has four chambers: the left atrium and right atrium at the top, and the left ventricle and right ventricle at the bottom.

More severe arrhythmias and those that produce intolerable symptoms may be treated with beta blockers (see page 562), calcium channel blockers (see page 563), or medications that slow the heart's electrical\n\nimpulses. You may need to try several drugs before finding the medication that works best for you.\n\nSome severe arrhythmias are treated surgically. Coronary artery bypass surgery (see page 564) and coronary angioplasty (see page 565) are sometimes used to treat arrhythmias that result from heart disease. A procedure called catheter ablation uses radiofrequency energy to destroy or remove a spot on the heart that is causing an arrhythmia. This procedure is similar to cardiac catheterization (see page 592); a catheter is threaded into the heart, and the radiofrequency therapy is delivered through the catheter.\n\nMany severe arrhythmias are treated by temporarily or permanently implanting an electronic pacemaker (see page 584) beneath the skin of the chest. A pacemaker is a battery-powered device that produces electrical impulses that regulate the heartbeat.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Cardiac Arrest]\nCardiac arrest means that the heart is beating ineffectively or has stopped beating. Possible causes of cardiac arrest include ventricular tachycardia (a rapid, ineffective heartbeat originating in the ventricles), ventricular fibrillation (a disorganized, ineffective attempt by the ventricles to contract), or cardiac asystole (cessation of heartbeat). When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart cannot beat effectively, the brain does not get enough blood, and loss of consciousness occurs immediately. Cardiac arrest in a person who seems healthy usually results from undetected heart disease (see page 558). Cardiac arrest can begin with ventricular tachycardia and degenerate into ventricular fibrillation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Cardiac Arrest > WARNING! > Cardiac Arrest]\nCardiac arrest is a medical emergency. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately if someone you know goes into cardiac arrest. If you are alone with the person, call for emergency medical assistance first, and then use a portable defibrillator if one is available. Or begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if you are trained to perform CPR. These techniques can stimulate the heart and keep the brain alive until emergency medical help arrives. It is possible to recover from cardiac arrest if the heartbeat and circulation are restored within a few minutes. The chances of recovering\n\nfrom cardiac arrest are good if emergency treatment is prompt and effective. If emergency treatment is delayed, damage to the heart and brain can be permanent.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf cardiac arrest is caused by ventricular fibrillation, the person's heartbeat can often be restored with a portable defibrillator (see below).\n\nIn people who have recurring episodes of ventricular tachycardia that does not respond to treatment with drugs, a device called an implantable defibrillator (see page 584) may be recommended. The device senses the onset of an arrhythmia and automatically provides a potentially lifesaving electrical shock to the heart muscle. Some implantable defibrillators also function as pacemakers (see page 584).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > **Portable Defibrillators Can Save Lives**]\nAn automatic external defibrillator is a portable electronic device that can be used to restore the heartbeat of a person whose heart is beating irregularly (fibrillating) or has stopped beating. With the push of a button, a person who has been trained to use the device can administer an electric shock to another person's heart through conductive adhesive pads placed directly on his or her chest. The device also analyzes the person's heart rhythm. Increasing numbers of public facilities, such as airports, shopping malls, hotels, and workplaces, have portable defibrillators available for use in an emergency. These devices come with easy-to-understand instructions, so even people who have not been trained can use them effectively.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > **Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter**]\nIn atrial fibrillation and flutter, the atria (the two upper chambers of the heart) contract (beat) irregularly and are not synchronized with the contractions (beating) of the ventricles (the two lower, pumping chambers of the heart). These uncoordinated heartbeats impair the heart's ability to pump blood to the tissues.\n\nAtrial flutter is similar to atrial fibrillation, except that in atrial flutter the muscles contract more regularly and at a somewhat slower rate. Both fibrillation and flutter tend to come and go, alternating with periods of normal heart rhythm.\n\nAtrial fibrillation and flutter are usually the result of heart disease (see page 558).

This condition is common and usually does not require treatment.\n\nIf you are bothered by an occasional irregular heartbeat, your doctor may prescribe medication to treat the condition. Frequent ectopic heartbeats may result from using too much caffeine, alcohol, or nicotine. If you use these substances, quit smoking and cut down on alcohol and coffee, tea, soft drinks, and other beverages that contain caffeine.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Heart Block]\nThe heart rate is controlled by a natural pacemaker called the sinoatrial node, a group of specialized cells in the wall of the right atrium (the upper right chamber of the heart). The sinoatrial node transmits electrical impulses between the atria and ventricles (the lower chambers of the heart), causing rhythmic contractions of the heart muscle, or heartbeats. If the sinoatrial node malfunctions, the beating of the atria is not coordinated with the beating of the ventricles.\n\nIn first-degree heart block, the electrical impulses take longer to travel from the atria to the ventricles. In second-degree heart block, some of the electrical impulses fail to reach the ventricles, causing an irregular heartbeat. In third-degree heart block, electrical impulses do not reach the ventricles, which continue beating slowly, independently of the sinoatrial node and the atria.\n\nIn healthy people, the heart rate increases during times of increased demand on the circulatory system, such as during exercise or periods of emotional stress. But in people who have heart block, heart rate does not increase despite an increased demand for blood, and the brain and other body tissues do not receive enough blood and oxygen to function properly.\n\nHeart block often occurs as a result of heart disease (see page 558) or a heart attack (see page 567). An overdose of a digitalis drug used to treat an irregular heartbeat can also cause heart block. In some people, heart block occurs for no obvious reason. The risk of heart block increases with age, and the disorder occurs most often in older people.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nIn most people, first-degree and second-degree heart block usually do not produce symptoms. Third-degree heart block may cause sudden loss of consciousness, seizures, or stroke. In some people, third-degree heart block may produce symptoms of heart failure (see page 570), such as shortness of breath or fatigue. If you are an older person and you have episodes of dizziness, weakness, or confusion, see your doctor as soon as possible. Although these symptoms have many possible causes, early detection and treatment of heart block may save your life.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose heart block, your doctor will examine you and will probably order an electrocardiogram (ECG; see page 559), an examination of the electrical activity of the heart. You may need to wear a portable electronic ECG device called a Holter monitor (see page 580) to record the electrical activity of your heart for 24 hours or longer.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf the doctor has determined that your heart's natural pacemaker is causing your symptoms, he or she may recommend temporary or permanent insertion of an artificial pacemaker (see next page) to regulate the heartbeat.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > Paroxysmal Atrial Tachycardia]\nIn healthy adults, the heart beats from 60 to 100 times per minute, and increases to about 160 beats per minute during physical activity. In an episode (or paroxysm) of atrial tachycardia, the heart rate suddenly jumps to 160 or more beats per minute without physical exertion. An episode of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia can last from about 1 minute to several days.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nPalpitations (heartbeats that you're aware of) are the main symptom of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia. If you suddenly become aware of your rapid heartbeat, you may become anxious or frightened. Some people who have paroxysmal atrial tachycardia say they have a feeling of impending death. Other symptoms can include shortness of\n\nbreath, fainting, angina (chest pain), or frequent urination. Despite the anxiety or fear it may cause, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia is not life-threatening, although sometimes it can lead to congestive heart failure (see page 570). If you have recurring symptoms of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, see your doctor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pacemakers and Implantable Defibrillators]\nAn electronic pacemaker is a battery-operated device that is often used to treat severe arrhythmias. A pacemaker may be temporary or permanent. A temporary pacemaker is usually inserted under the skin of the chest after a heart attack has disturbed the heart's normal rhythm. The pacemaker produces electrical impulses that keep the heart beating at a normal rate.

Most people do not have any problems as long as they follow all their doctor's instructions, which usually include eating a prescribed diet, taking medication, and keeping all follow-up appointments.\n\nYour doctor will give you a card that indicates that you have a pacemaker or implantable defibrillator. Always carry this card with you so that emergency medical personnel will know what treatment to provide in case of an emergency. Most people who have a pacemaker or implantable defibrillator become very aware of their heart and how it is supposed to function. If you notice that your heart is suddenly beating more slowly, more rapidly, or irregularly; if you feel dizzy or faint; or if you are short of breath, call 911 or your local emergency number, or go to the nearest hospital emergency department immediately.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Implantable defibrillator**]\nAn implantable defibrillator is an electronic device that is implanted just beneath the skin of the abdomen and attached with very thin wires to the heart. Whenever it is needed, the defibrillator delivers an electrical charge to the heart to slow a potentially dangerous rapid heartbeat and return the heartbeat to normal.\n\n![Diagram illustrating a portable electronic ECG device (Holter monitor) worn on the chest. The device includes an electrode in the right ventricle, an electronic sensor that monitors heart rate, and a defibrillator power source connected to defibrillator wires.]()![](_page_1063_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, your doctor will examine you, and may order an electrocardiogram (ECG; see page 559) to evaluate the electrical activity of your heart. If your symptoms come and go, you may need to wear a portable electronic ECG device called a Holter monitor (see page 580) to record the electrical activity of your heart over a period of 24 hours or more.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf you have palpitations, try to slow your heart rate by holding your breath, taking a slow drink of cold water, or rinsing your face with cold water. If these measures do not help, try bearing down as if having a bowel movement. This is called the Valsalva maneuver and can sometimes correct an arrhythmia.\n\nTo help prevent further episodes, your doctor will probably recommend that you cut down on alcohol and caffeine and quit smoking (if you smoke). He or she may massage the carotid artery in your neck to try to slow your heart rate. The doctor may prescribe medication that decreases the excitability of the heart muscle and prevents the heart rate from increasing. In some cases, the doctor may inject a medication that helps slow a\n\nrapid heartbeat. In severe cases of persistent atrial tachycardia, the doctor may recommend cardioversion (see page 582), a procedure in which an electrical shock is administered to the heart while the person is under mild anesthesia.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Heart Valve Disorders]\nThe heart has four valves. The mitral valve controls the flow of blood from the left atrium (the filling chamber on the upper left side of the heart) into the left ventricle (the pumping chamber on the lower left side of the heart). The tricuspid valve performs the same function between the right atrium and right ventricle. The pulmonary valve controls the opening from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery, which carries blood into the lungs. The aortic valve controls the movement of blood from the left ventricle into the aorta (the main artery in the body).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Heart Valve Disorders > How heart valves work]\nWith each heartbeat, the left ventricle contracts and pumps fresh, oxygenated blood out of the heart. The aortic and pulmonary valves open to let blood flow out of the heart and into the arteries. Between heartbeats, the ventricles relax and the aortic and pulmonary valves close. The mitral and tricuspid valves then open to allow blood to flow into the ventricles from the atria. The constant and regular repetition of this cycle keeps blood circulating throughout the body.\n\n![Diagram of the human heart showing major blood vessels and chambers. Labeled structures include: Superior vena cava, Pulmonary veins, Right atrium, Tricuspid valve, Inferior vena cava, Aorta, Pulmonary artery, Left atrium, Aortic valve, Mitral valve, and Left ventricle.]()![](_page_1065_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nWhen a valve does not open wide enough, the heart must work harder to pump out an adequate supply of blood to the rest of the body. When a valve does not close completely, some of the blood leaks back into the heart, which must then pump it out again.

If additional testing is needed, your doctor may order a chest X-ray, an electrocardiogram (ECG; see page 559), and possibly a Doppler echocardiogram (see page 561). A Doppler echocardiogram can measure the speed of blood flow through the mitral valve, allowing the doctor to determine how much the valve has narrowed.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nYour doctor may prescribe a diuretic to help your body eliminate excess fluid and decrease swelling. However, because diuretics may also cause loss of potassium (a mineral that is essential for the heart muscle to contract and maintain a normal heart rhythm), your doctor also may prescribe a potassium supplement. If you have atrial fibrillation, your doctor will prescribe medication to control it. He or she also may prescribe anticoagulants to prevent the formation of blood clots in the left atrium.\n\nIf your mitral stenosis is severe and interferes with your daily activities, your doctor may recommend a surgical procedure called balloon valvuloplasty. In this procedure, the doctor guides a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) through an artery to the damaged valve. He or she then guides a tiny deflated balloon through the catheter to the valve and then inflates the balloon, opening the valve. This procedure is highly effective in relieving symptoms of mitral stenosis.\n\nDoctors may recommend surgery for pregnant women who have severe symptoms of mitral stenosis. In an open-heart procedure called mitral valvotomy, the surgeon widens the valve. In many cases, symptoms do not return, or return years later. If your symptoms return, you may need to have a second mitral valvotomy, or your doctor may recommend heart valve replacement surgery (see page 590). Most people who have a heart valve replacement survive for at least 5 years.\n\nIf your symptoms are not severe, you should be able to lead an active life without treatment. However, you will need to take prescription antibiotics as a precaution before having any dental treatment or surgery, to protect you from developing infective endocarditis (see page 593), a potentially life-threatening infection of the inner lining of the heart muscle.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > **Balloon valvuloplasty**]\nIn balloon valvuloplasty, the surgeon inserts a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) into an artery in the groin area and threads the catheter to the damaged heart valve. He or she then guides a tiny deflated balloon through the catheter to the valve and inflates the balloon, opening the valve. The balloon is then deflated and withdrawn along with the catheter.\n\n![Diagram of the heart showing a damaged mitral valve. A catheter is inserted into the heart. A balloon is inflated to reopen the valve.]()![](_page_1070_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Mitral Regurgitation]\nIf the mitral valve does not close properly, the blood circulating through the heart may leak back into the left atrium (one of the two upper chambers of the heart) from the left ventricle (one of the two lower, pumping chambers of the heart). This condition, called mitral regurgitation or mitral insufficiency, increases the heart's workload, causing the muscular heart wall to enlarge. The left atrium also becomes enlarged.\n\nMitral regurgitation often results from an abnormality of the mitral valve called mitral valve prolapse (see page 591), which causes the valve to move abnormally when the ventricles contract. When the valve flaps do not meet to close, blood leaks back through the opening. Mitral regurgitation may be congenital (present at birth), or it may result from infective endocarditis (see page 593), a potentially life-threatening infection of the inner lining of the heart muscle, or from any heart muscle disorder that causes the left ventricle to enlarge and widen.\n\n[OL", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Mitral Stenosis", "relation": "causes", "tail": "Increased pressure and congestion in the lungs"}, {"head": "Healthy mitral valve", "relation": "allows", "tail": "oxygen-rich blood to flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "Mitral stenosis", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: congestiv"}, {"head": "Pressure rise in the atrium", "relation": "results in", "tail": "[Event: increased pressure and congestion in the lungs]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: Pressure rise in the atrium]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: congestiv"}, {"head": "[Event: Increased pressure and congestion in the lungs]", "relation": "results from", "tail": "[Event: Mitral stenosis]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Mechanical valves last a long time, but you will need to take anticoagulant drugs to help prevent blood clot formation.

Mechanical valves are made of metal and plastic; tissue valves are made from animal or human tissue. A mechanical heart valve allows blood to flow in one direction by forcing the metal valve flaps (leaflets) apart. If blood begins to flow in the opposite direction, it forces the leaflets together firmly against the ring, closing the valve. A tissue heart valve functions like a natural heart valve.\n\n![Diagram showing a cross-section of a heart valve made of tissue, illustrating the leaflet structure.]()![](_page_1074_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nHeart valve made of tissue\n\n![Diagram showing a cross-section of a mechanical heart valve, illustrating the internal mechanism.]()![](_page_1074_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\nMechanical heart valve\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Mitral Valve Prolapse]\nMitral valve prolapse is a deformity of the mitral valve that can sometimes produce mitral regurgitation (see page 589). Mitral valve prolapse produces a sound called a heart murmur that a doctor can hear through a stethoscope. This condition affects about 5 percent of Americans and is much more common in women than in men.\n\nThe cause of mitral valve prolapse is usually not known, but it may result from an inherited weakness in the connective tissue of the valve that allows the valve to bulge. Occasionally, mitral valve prolapse results from rheumatic fever (see page 432), heart disease (see page 558), or cardiomyopathy (a degenerative disease of the heart muscle).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Mitral Valve Prolapse > *Symptoms*]\nSymptoms of mitral valve prolapse may include chest pain, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), shortness of breath, or fatigue. However, most people who have mitral valve prolapse have no symptoms.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Mitral Valve Prolapse > *Treatment*]\nTreatment for mitral valve prolapse is usually not necessary. However, people who have both mitral valve prolapse and mitral regurgitation need to take antibiotic drugs before having any type of dental treatment or surgery to help prevent infective endocarditis (see page 593), a potentially life-threatening infection of the inner lining of the heart muscle. When mitral valve prolapse is severe enough to cause heart failure, a doctor may prescribe heart disease medications such as beta blockers, diuretics, or digitalis drugs, or he or she may recommend heart valve replacement surgery (see previous page).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Aortic Stenosis]\nAortic stenosis occurs when the aortic valve (the valve between the aorta and the left ventricle) becomes abnormally thick or the valve flaps (leaflets) become stuck together, narrowing the opening. The aorta is the artery through which the left ventricle of the heart pumps blood to the body tissues. If the opening becomes narrowed, the volume of blood that the heart can pump decreases. In an effort to squeeze more blood through the valve and keep the volume of blood pumped by the heart normal, the muscular wall of the left ventricle thickens. This thicker, harder-working tissue requires more and more blood to keep working. The blood squirting past the obstructed valve produces a sound called a heart murmur that a doctor can hear through a stethoscope.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Healthy mitral valve]\nA healthy mitral valve allows oxygen-rich blood to flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle, the main pumping chamber of the heart.\n\n![Diagram of the human heart showing the flow of blood through the left side.

The left ventricle of the heart pumps blood through the aorta (the main artery in the body) to body tissues. If the aortic valve does not close properly, blood can leak back into the left ventricle, causing a sound called a heart murmur, which a doctor can hear through a stethoscope. A congenital (present at birth) abnormality of the valve is usually the cause of aortic insufficiency. Other possible causes include infective endocarditis (a potentially life-threatening infection of the inner lining of the heart muscle; see right), syphilis (see page 483), or stretching of the tissues that support the aortic valve.\n\nIn severe cases of aortic insufficiency, the left ventricle enlarges and its walls thicken as the heart responds to an increased workload. The large volume of blood pumped into the aorta may cause the arteries to pulsate abnormally, which is a sign of severe aortic insufficiency. In some cases, the aortic valve ruptures as a result of damage caused by infective endocarditis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > ***Symptoms***]\nIn most cases, symptoms do not occur until many years after the problem begins to develop. However, if the valve suddenly ruptures or if the heart muscle loses its effectiveness, a person can have shortness of breath, fatigue, or other symptoms of congestive heart failure (see page 570).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > ***Diagnosis***]\nTo diagnose aortic insufficiency, a doctor performs a physical examination and will order diagnostic tests such as an echocardiogram (see page 561), an ultrasound examination of the heart, or an electrocardiogram (ECG; see page 559), a recording of the electrical activity of the heart. The doctor also may order blood tests to rule out rheumatoid arthritis (see page 918), ankylosing spondylitis (see page 1002), or syphilis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe treatment for aortic insufficiency is the same as the treatment for aortic stenosis (see page 591). Heart valve replacement surgery (see page 590) is usually required.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Infective Endocarditis**]\nThe endocardium is the inner lining of the heart muscle and covering of the heart valves. If the endocardium is damaged, such as from mitral regurgitation (see page 589), bacteria or other germs can infect the damaged area. As the microorganisms multiply, they cause more damage to the endocardium and may travel through the bloodstream to other parts of the body. The microorganisms can form infected blood clots that can lodge in small arteries and block blood flow. Gradually, the multiplying microorganisms cause severe damage to the heart valves, resulting in heart failure (see page 570).\n\nMost people who develop infective endocarditis have an underlying heart valve disorder, such as mitral valve prolapse (see page 591) or congenital (present at birth) lesions of the heart valves. Heart valve replacement surgery (see page 590) can sometimes lead to infective endocarditis. Bacteria also can enter the bloodstream during minor surgery, tooth extractions, teeth cleaning, endoscopy (an examination of the inside of the body using a viewing instrument), or by injecting illicit drugs with contaminated syringes or needles. To prevent infective endocarditis, people who have heart disease need to take antibiotics immediately before surgery or dental treatment or promptly after any skin infections develop. This precaution helps destroy any bacteria that might otherwise enter the bloodstream and cause infective endocarditis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nA person with infective endocarditis usually has a fever of less than 102°F. Other possible symptoms include sudden chills (especially after the bacteria have spread\n\nthrough the bloodstream), headaches, aching joints, fatigue, and loss of appetite. If the heart valves are affected, symptoms of heart failure (see page 570) may occur eventually.\n\nIf blood clots form, symptoms depend on their location. For example, if clots form in the hands or feet, you may have painful lumps in the tips of your fingers or toes, or small bruises behind your nails. A clot that lodges in the brain can cause a stroke (see page 669). Clots from bacterial endocarditis can lodge anywhere in the body, sometimes causing small abscesses (pus-filled cavities surrounded by inflamed tissue) to form. Bacterial endocarditis can also cause anemia or kidney disease, both of which usually clear up after the infection is treated successfully. If you have any of the symptoms described above, see your doctor as soon as possible.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nBecause the symptoms of infective endocarditis can be caused by a number of diseases and conditions, tell your doctor if you have had a heart valve disorder or a heart murmur, or", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "aortic valve", "relation": "does not close properly", "tail": "aortic insufficiency"}, {"head": "left ventricle", "relation": "pumps blood through the aorta", "tail": "body tissues"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "hear", "tail": "[Event: heart murmur]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "has", "tail": "[Event: infective endocarditis]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: aortic valve does not close properly]", "relation": "may develop", "tail": "[Event: aortic insufficiency]"}, {"head": "[Event: blood can leak back into the left ventricle]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: heart murmur]"}]}, "status": "success"}

If heart muscle is diseased or damaged, the force of the heartbeat decreases and reduces blood circulation. The term cardiomyopathy is used to refer to several forms of heart muscle disease. In cardiomyopathy, the tiny muscle fibers of the heart are damaged, often from an unknown cause. Over time, this damage decreases the ability of the heart muscle to contract, leading to widening of the ventricles (the pumping chambers of the heart) and eventually to heart failure (see page 570). In some people, the damage is confined to the heart. In other people, other organs are affected as well. Cardiomyopathies generally occur less often than most other types of heart disorders. Although some types of cardiomyopathy run in families, the cause is usually unknown.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Heart Muscle and Pericardium Disorders > Myocarditis]\nMyocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, is a type of cardiomyopathy that occurs as a rare complication of an infection, usually caused by a virus.

You may also have a heart muscle biopsy, in which a small amount of tissue is removed from the heart muscle in a cardiac catheterization procedure (see page 592) and examined under a microscope.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nMyocarditis is usually caused by a virus, for which there is no specific treatment. The doctor will recommend complete rest. In some cases, a doctor will prescribe a corticosteroid drug to reduce inflammation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > **Nutritional Cardiomyopathy**]\nHeart muscle can be damaged by toxins. In the United States, the most severe form of cardiomyopathy caused by toxins occurs among people who drink alcohol heavily. Excessive intake of alcohol can poison the heart muscle. In rare cases, inadequate intake of vitamin B1 (which is often deficient in heavy drinkers) causes cardiomyopathy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of nutritional cardiomyopathy vary greatly from one person to another. Symptoms may include palpitations (heartbeats that you're aware of) or an irregular or very rapid heartbeat, or swollen hands and feet. Because damage to the heart muscle can lead to disorders such as atrial fibrillation (see page 581) and heart failure (see page 570), a person also may have symptoms of these disorders.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nA doctor will recommend that a person with nutritional cardiomyopathy stop drinking alcohol. The doctor may also prescribe dietary changes or vitamin supplements. The condition improves in about one third of the people who give up alcohol. In the remaining two thirds, treatment is the same as that for heart failure.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy**]\nDefective cells in the heart muscle, possibly as a result of a congenital (present at birth) abnormality, may cause the heart muscle to weaken. To compensate for the weakened heart muscle, the walls of the heart may thicken. In severe cases, the thickened walls can interfere with blood flow into and out of the heart.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nSymptoms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy include fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations (heartbeats that you're aware of).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a doctor will order diagnostic tests such as a chest X-ray; an electrocardiogram (ECG; see page 559), a recording of the electrical activity of the heart; and an echocardiogram (see page 561), an ultrasound examination of the heart.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThere is no cure for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but symptoms can be relieved with heart disease medications such as beta blockers, which help slow the heart rate, and diuretics, which help eliminate excess fluid from the body. Calcium channel blockers help the heart fill with blood more efficiently. If symptoms become severe, especially if blood flow from the heart is obstructed, surgery to remove some of the excess heart muscle can significantly improve symptoms. Some people who have heart failure as a result of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will need a heart transplant (see page 573).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Acute Pericarditis]\nPericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, the membrane that surrounds the heart.

Your doctor may also recommend cardiac catheterization (see page 592), a procedure to measure the pressure in the arteries and ventricles and to check for possible underlying diseases. The doctor may also order a CT scan (see page 562) or an MRI (see page 113) to evaluate the thickness of the pericardium. He or she will probably order tests of the skin and of phlegm to rule out tuberculosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > **Location of constrictive pericarditis pain**]\n![Diagram showing a human torso with a large, dark, irregular mass located centrally on the chest, representing the location of constrictive pericarditis pain.]()![](_page_1088_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nConstrictive pericarditis can be treated with a surgical procedure called pericardectomy. In this procedure, the surgeon carefully removes the thickened pericardium from the surface of the heart, which relieves the symptoms significantly.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Disorders of the Circulation**]\nBlood follows two distinct circuits as it flows through the body. In the longer circuit (called the systemic circulation), the heart pumps oxygen-rich blood throughout the body to supply the tissues with oxygen and nutrients and to\n\npick up carbon dioxide and other waste products. In the shorter circuit (called the pulmonary circulation), the heart pumps oxygen-depleted blood through the lungs to receive a fresh supply of oxygen and discard carbon dioxide. The blood then returns to the heart, and the cycle begins again.\n\nThe arteries that carry blood away from the heart have thick, muscular walls to absorb the peaks of blood pressure that occur every time the heart beats. The aorta (the main artery in the body) has an internal diameter of about  $1\\frac{1}{4}$  inches. It branches into smaller arteries, then into tiny arterioles, and finally into microscopic capillaries with thin, porous walls that allow easy exchange of oxygen and nutrients for carbon dioxide and other waste products. Gradually the capillaries combine to form small veins called venules, and the venules combine to form soft-walled, flexible veins, which return oxygen-depleted blood to the heart.\n\nBlood does not flow at a constant rate to all parts of the body. The rate varies according to the amount of blood the tissues need at a given time. For example, when you are running, your leg muscles receive more blood than they do when you are resting. When you feel cold, less blood flows in superficial blood vessels near the chilled skin, and more blood flows in deeper vessels, to conserve heat. This pattern reverses when you feel hot, making you perspire to avoid becoming overheated.\n\nThe circulatory system is complex, and it can stop working if the heart malfunctions or if problems develop inside the blood vessels. For example, artery walls may weaken or harden, causing circulation problems or high blood pressure. Blood clots can form and block blood vessels, and a number of other disorders, some mild and some severe, can affect circulation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Disorders of the Circulation** > The circulatory system]\nThe circulatory system, which consists of the heart and blood vessels, continuously transports oxygen and other nutrients to all the cells of the body and removes carbon dioxide and other waste products. Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart; veins return oxygen-depleted blood to the heart to receive a fresh supply of oxygen.\n\nDiagram illustrating the major blood vessels and veins in the human body, showing the systemic circulation (venous return to the heart and arterial supply to the body).\n\n- Jugular vein\n- Subclavian vein\n- Superior vena cava\n- Inferior vena cava\n- Hepatic vein\n- Radial artery\n- Common iliac vein\n- Femoral vein\n- Great saphenous vein\n- Carotid artery\n- Subclavian artery\n- Aorta\n- Pulmonary artery\n- Heart\n- Descending aorta\n- Brachial artery\n- Common iliac artery\n- Femoral artery\n\n![](_page_1090_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Disorders of the Circulation** > Blood flow to and from heart]\nOxygen-depleted blood returns from the tissues to the heart, which pumps it to the lungs for a fresh supply of oxygen.

Saccular or fusiform aneurysms usually do not cause symptoms. However, if a large aneurysm forms in the thoracic aorta (the portion of the aorta that passes through the chest), it may cause chest pain, back pain, hoarseness, shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, or a persistent cough. A dissecting aneurysm in the thoracic aorta usually causes severe chest pain and shortness of breath, and may be mistaken for a heart attack.\n\nA large saccular or fusiform aneurysm in the abdominal aorta (the portion of the aorta that passes through the abdomen) is often visible as a pulsating lump on the surface of the abdomen. If the aneurysm is toward the back, it may press on the spine and cause severe backache, especially if the aneurysm expands or ruptures. Dissecting aneurysms of the abdominal aorta are rare. When they develop, the main symptom is severe abdominal or intestinal pain.\n\nAlthough aneurysms in the peripheral arteries of the arms and legs are not common and are not considered dangerous, an aneurysm that forms in the artery behind the knee can suddenly clot, blocking blood flow and causing gangrene (see page 601) of the leg.\n\nIf you have symptoms of an aortic aneurysm or if you notice an unexplainable lump anywhere on your body, especially on your abdomen, and particularly if it throbs, see your doctor right away. Most people who have a ruptured aneurysm die before they can get emergency medical treatment.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nAneurysms are often detected during a routine physical examination or when a person has an ultrasound (see page 111), a CT scan (see page 112), an MRI (see page 113), or conventional X-rays for another purpose. If a person has symptoms of an aneurysm, these imaging procedures are often used to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe usual treatment for an aneurysm is surgery to repair or replace the affected portion of the artery with a tiny plastic tube. In people who do not have other health problems, most elective surgical procedures performed on aneurysms in either the thoracic (chest) or abdominal aortas are successful.\n\nIf an aneurysm in the thoracic aorta can be treated with surgery, chances of recovery are very good. If the aneurysm cannot be treated surgically, chances of survival are poor. In general, small aneurysms in the abdominal aorta are not life-threatening and usually do not require immediate treatment. Aneurysms in the abdominal aorta are removed surgically only if they are large or are expanding. Before recommending surgery, a doctor will usually monitor the aneurysm with ultrasound or CT scanning to determine how rapidly it is expanding. If a person is in generally good health, elective surgery on a large or rapidly expanding aneurysm carries far less risk than emergency surgery performed after the aneurysm has ruptured.\n\nIn a procedure called stent grafting, the doctor inserts a thin, flexible wire into an artery in the groin area and, observing the aorta on a video monitor, threads the wire to the aortic aneurysm. He or she then guides a tiny tube called a stent along the wire to the aneurysm. Once the stent is inside the aneurysm, the doctor expands it until it bridges the area of the aneurysm. By providing a sturdy new channel for blood flow, the stent relieves pressure on the weakened artery walls.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Arterial Embolism]\nAn embolus is usually a fragment of clotted blood or a piece of a fatty deposit (plaque) that is carried along in the bloodstream. The embolus may be very small, but, because the arteries branch into smaller and smaller blood vessels as they deliver blood to the tissues, the embolus will eventually get stuck and create a blockage (called an embolism) that prevents blood from reaching the tissues beyond the blockage. An embolus may develop in the heart after a heart attack (see page 567) or from another heart disorder. It may be a fragment of bacterial growth resulting from bacterial endocarditis (see page 593). In rare cases, an embolus may be a tiny foreign object that entered an artery through a wound, or a gas bubble that formed in the tissues.\n\nThe severity of an arterial embolism depends on its size and location. Some organs, such as the brain, kidneys, and heart, are extremely sensitive to sudden decreases in blood supply. Other organs have multiple sources of blood and may not be affected significantly by an embolism. Although arterial embolisms most often affect the brain and legs, they can occur anywhere in the body.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nA small embolism usually goes unnoticed unless it blocks the blood supply to a large area or to a very sensitive organ such as the heart or brain.

In the early stages, the limb is cold, with a dull, aching pain that increases with physical activity. If your foot is painful or unusually pale and you have poor circulation, see your doctor immediately. Pain is also the main symptom of infected gangrene. The area around the wound becomes red, swollen, extremely painful, and oozes pus. The wound may develop an unpleasant odor. The person usually experiences extreme pain while the tissue is dying, but once the tissue is dead, the pain disappears. The tissue slowly turns black, and a visible line separates the dead tissue from living tissue.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nFor dry gangrene, a doctor will treat the underlying disorder that is blocking blood flow to the affected area. He or she may prescribe antibiotics to prevent infection. Doctors treat infected gangrene with antibiotics to kill the bacteria and with surgery to remove the dying and dead skin, muscle, and bone. Usually some healthy tissue next to the dead, gangrenous tissue also must be removed. To prevent the infection from spreading to healthy tissue, the doctor may recommend soaking an affected hand or foot in an antiseptic solution, removing any layer of pus that forms, and elevating the affected hand or foot as often as possible.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Preventing Gangrene*]\nDry gangrene can be prevented by taking steps to help maintain good circulation, such as exercising regularly and not smoking. If you have diabetes, work with your doctor to keep the disease under control. Take special care of your feet (see page 892) and always wear shoes that fit properly. If you have symptoms of dry gangrene, see your doctor immediately for treatment.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Varicose Veins**]\nVaricose veins are veins directly beneath the skin that have become stretched and twisted over time. This condition usually occurs in the legs when veins lose their elasticity and widen, causing the edges of the valves inside the veins to separate. The veins are then unable to return blood to the heart, causing blood to collect in the veins, widening them further.\n\nVaricose veins are often visible because they lie directly under the skin. Although they are often unsightly, varicose veins seldom cause serious symptoms or health problems. Some people inherit a tendency to develop severe varicose veins. Varicose veins in the legs often result from excess pressure caused by standing for long periods. In severe cases, blood can clot on the inflamed, roughened walls of varicose veins, which can lead to thrombophlebitis (see next page), a more serious condition.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Blood flow in normal veins and in varicose veins**]\nVaricose veins occur when the valves in the veins are no longer able to close properly, which interferes with the ability of the veins to return blood to the heart. Blood flows\n\nbackward through the open valve, increasing pressure inside the vein and causing it to widen and stretch.\n\nDiagram illustrating blood flow in veins:\n\n**Normal blood flow in healthy veins:** A closed valve prevents blood from flowing back.\n\n**Abnormal blood flow in varicose veins:** Blood flows backward through a weakened valve.\n\n![](_page_1099_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nVaricose veins usually appear bluish and swollen and are more prominent when you are standing. They usually occur at the back of the calf or on the inside of the leg between the ankle and the groin. Varicose veins can also occur in the rectal area (see page 777), in the vagina during pregnancy, or where the esophagus meets the stomach in advanced cases of cirrhosis of the liver (see page 790).\n\nA varicose vein in the leg may gradually enlarge. The vein may become tender to the touch, and the skin above it or at the ankle may begin to itch. The entire leg may ache, especially when you stand for long periods. Your feet may become swollen after standing for a short period and your shoes may seem very tight by the end of the day. During pregnancy, varicose veins may worsen because of increased pressure in the abdomen. Symptoms usually do not worsen if only superficial veins are affected. But when deep veins are also involved, circulation can be impaired, causing persistent leg\n\nswelling and a brownish skin discoloration, especially near the ankles. An itchy rash may develop near the affected vein.\n\nIn some people, varicose veins can significantly reduce the supply of blood to the tissues, causing the skin to break down and form an ulcer. A varicose ulcer will not heal until the vein has been treated successfully.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nBecause varicose veins are frequently visible under the skin, a doctor can usually detect them during a physical examination.

The blood then reroutes itself through healthy veins nearby. Treatment is usually completed in two or three visits to an outpatient facility or a doctor's office.\n\n![Diagram illustrating sclerotherapy. A doctor injects a solution labeled 'Solution injected into vein' directly into a vein labeled 'Varicose veins'.]()![](_page_1102_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\nAfter undergoing stripping or sclerotherapy, you will need to wear support stockings for about 6 weeks. Your doctor will recommend that you walk as much as possible, avoid standing for long periods, and frequently sit with your legs elevated above the level of your chest.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Spider Veins]\nSpider veins are very tiny veins that are visible under the skin of the thighs and legs. Although they may be unsightly, spider veins do not cause any health problems. Cosmetic laser treatments or chemical injections can make spider veins less visible, but these procedures may not produce permanent results.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Thrombophlebitis]\nPhlebitis is inflammation of a vein, usually caused by infection or injury. When phlebitis occurs, blood flow through the roughened, swollen vein may become sluggish, encouraging blood clots (thrombi) to develop and adhere to the walls of the vein. This condition, called thrombophlebitis, often occurs in the superficial veins in the legs. In rare cases, thrombophlebitis occurs in the arms.\n\nWomen are slightly more likely to develop thrombophlebitis than men. The condition also occurs more frequently in people who have varicose veins (see page 602). In rare cases, people who are undergoing medical treatment that involves piercing the veins with needles (such as inserting an intravenous line) develop thrombophlebitis.\n\nAn untreated infection can lead to blood poisoning (see page 937). There is also a very slight chance that blood clots break off, travel through the bloodstream, and block a blood vessel. However, the most serious risk of thrombophlebitis is that the clot may travel to a more vulnerable spot, such as a deeper vein, most likely in the leg or pelvic area (see next article).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptoms of thrombophlebitis are pain, redness, warmth, tenderness, itching, or swelling under the skin along the length of the affected vein. If the area is infected, you may also have a fever.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA doctor can diagnose thrombophlebitis from a person's symptoms and an examination of the affected area. Tests are usually not needed.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf you have thrombophlebitis, your doctor may recommend that you take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as aspirin or ibuprofen to relieve pain and inflammation. If you have an infection, he or she may prescribe an antibiotic. The doctor may also recommend that you rest frequently, elevate the affected leg, and apply warm, moist compresses to the affected area. A nonprescription zinc oxide ointment can help relieve itching; ask your doctor to recommend one. The doctor also may recommend that you\n\nwear elastic support stockings. With treatment, thrombophlebitis usually clears up within a few weeks.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Deep Vein Thrombosis]\nThrombosis is the formation of a blood clot (thrombus), which can partially or completely block a blood vessel. If a blood clot forms in a deeper vein, the condition is called deep vein thrombosis. Although deep vein thrombosis occurs most frequently in the legs and lower abdomen, it can occur anywhere in the body. The two main causes of deep vein thrombosis are injury to the lining of a vein and sluggish blood flow.\n\nIf you are older or are overweight or if you have injured your pelvis or a bone in your leg, you have an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis. The condition often develops during periods of immobility, especially while recovering from surgery or serious illness. Thrombosis also frequently occurs when an arm or leg is immobilized in a cast to stabilize a broken bone, or in the legs after a long trip on a plane or train. In these situations, blood flow tends to become sluggish. The disorder may also affect people whose blood clots more easily than normal, such as those who have a genetic defect in blood-clotting factors or a disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (see page 920) or polycythemia (see page 627). Women over age 35 who smoke cigarettes and also take birth-control pills are at increased risk of thrombosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nIn deep vein thrombosis, the area drained by the vein, usually the calf or thigh, becomes swollen and painful as blood flow to it is obstructed.

Because the heart and tissues are not getting enough oxygen, the main symptom is usually shortness of breath. The person may also feel faint and have chest pain when inhaling. Other possible symptoms include a cough, bloody phlegm, and cyanosis (a bluish tinge) around the mouth.\n\nAny blockage of blood flow to the lungs can lead to heart failure (see page 570). If a large pulmonary embolism causes the circulatory system to stop functioning, death usually occurs within minutes.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nAnything that predisposes you to deep vein thrombosis also increases your risk of pulmonary embolism. See your doctor if you have symptoms of either disorder, especially if you have recently been confined to bed. Your doctor will examine you and may order a chest X-ray and an electrocardiogram (ECG; see page 559) to determine whether your heart, especially the right side, is under strain. To confirm the diagnosis, the doctor may order a radionuclide scan (see page 114) or CT scan (see page 112) of the lungs. If any doubt remains, he or she may order a pulmonary angiogram to examine arteries in the lungs. A pulmonary angiogram is the same as a coronary angiogram (see page 561), except that it examines the arteries in the lungs instead of in the heart.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf you have a pulmonary embolism, you will need to be hospitalized for treatment with anticoagulants (blood thinners) and possibly thrombolytic drugs (clot busters). Heparin, an anticoagulant, helps prevent more blood clots from forming in your lungs and veins. The drug is infused directly into a vein. Occasionally, thrombolytic drugs such as streptokinase or tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) are used to help dissolve blood clots in the lungs. Because treatment with the combination of thrombolytic and anticoagulant drugs carries a risk of internal bleeding, your doctor will closely monitor the ability of your blood to clot normally.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pulmonary Angiogram]\nA pulmonary angiogram, also called a pulmonary arteriogram, allows doctors to examine the pulmonary arteries on film. A catheter (a thin, flexible tube) is usually inserted into a large vein in the groin area and threaded up through the heart to the pulmonary artery (the main artery in the lungs). A contrast medium (dye) is injected through the catheter into the pulmonary artery, and a series of rapid-sequence X-rays (like a movie) of the artery and its smaller branches is taken. The arteries are clearly visible, allowing the doctor to detect any blood clots in the blood vessels.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pulmonary embolism]\nPart of a blood clot in a deep vein in the leg may break off. When carried along in the bloodstream, the fragment (embolus) can travel to the lungs and block blood flow, causing a pulmonary embolism, which starves the area of the lung beyond the blockage.\n\n![Diagram illustrating how a pulmonary embolism develops.

The doctor will prescribe an anticoagulant to help prevent the formation of more blood clots, thereby reducing the risk of another embolism.\n\nIf an embolism is severe, immediate emergency medical treatment is required. The blockage will probably need to be removed surgically. If a person survives the critical first few days after a massive pulmonary embolism, he or she has a good chance of long-term recovery. The chances of recovery are even better if the source of the embolism, usually deep vein thrombosis (see page 605), is detected and treated successfully.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Blood Disorders]\nBlood has two basic components: blood cells and plasma (the fluid in which blood cells are suspended). Most blood cells are red blood cells, or erythrocytes, which carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Red blood cells contain a protein called hemoglobin, which combines with oxygen in the lungs and delivers it to tissues as blood circulates through the body. Red blood cells also return some of the waste product carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs, where it is exhaled and eliminated from the body.\n\nBlood also contains several types of white blood cells, which fight infectio", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "pulmonary embolism", "relation": "cause", "tail": "heart failure"}, {"head": "deep vein thrombosis", "relation": "increase risk of", "tail": "pulmonary embolism"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: blockage of blood flow to the lungs]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: heart failure]"}, {"head": "[Event: large pulmonary embolism]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: death within minutes]"}]}, "status": "success"}

In healthy people, iron from old red blood cells is stored in the body and used to produce hemoglobin in new red blood cells. The small amount of iron that is normally lost from the body is replaced by iron absorbed from iron-rich foods such as lean red\n\nmeat, green leafy vegetables, and whole-grain products. If the body loses more iron than it absorbs, the bone marrow produces fewer and smaller red blood cells, and anemia develops. Iron deficiency anemia is usually not life-threatening, but it can weaken the body's resistance to the effects of another illness or an injury.\n\nA shortage of iron in the body has a number of possible causes. In most people who have iron deficiency anemia, stored iron has been depleted by excessive blood loss. For example, women who have extremely heavy menstrual periods can deplete their supply of iron and develop anemia. (Women who have normal periods seldom have a problem maintaining an adequate supply of iron.) Blood loss from the intestinal tract can result from digestive system disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD; see page 750), a peptic ulcer (see page 755) or duodenal ulcer (see page 756), polyps (see page 773), or cancer of the colon (see page 775).\n\nSome people may not take in enough iron in their diet to replace the iron they lose each day. This condition occurs mainly in young children, pregnant women, and people who are on a restricted diet. Sometimes a person's digestive system is unable to absorb iron from food, no matter how much iron is in his or her diet. This problem occurs in some disorders of the small intestine that affect absorption of nutrients, such as celiac disease (see page 768), which blocks the absorption of gluten (a protein found in foods that contain wheat, rye, oats, or barley).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nInitial symptoms of iron deficiency anemia often are so mild that they go unnoticed. Symptoms can include abnormally pale skin, weakness, fatigue, faintness, or shortness of breath. A person may have palpitations (heartbeats that you're aware of) when his or her heart tries to compensate for decreased blood flow by pumping blood at a faster rate. The person may have a sore, inflamed tongue; headaches; a poor appetite; and an increased susceptibility to infection. Some people with anemia may also experience restless legs syndrome (see page 705), perhaps resulting from impaired blood flow to the legs. They may be unable to keep their legs still, and sometimes may experience a tingling or crawling sensation in their legs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have symptoms of iron deficiency anemia, your doctor will examine you and order blood tests to evaluate the number, size, and color of the red cells in your blood\n\nand the amount of hemoglobin they contain. (Iron-deficient red cells are smaller and paler than normal red cells.) The doctor also will order tests to help determine if an underlying disease is causing the anemia. In most cases, a doctor may order a blood test to measure the level of the protein ferritin. Because ferritin helps the body store iron, a low level of ferritin in the blood indicates a low level of iron. You will probably have tests to measure the amount of iron and vitamin B12 in your blood, and a test to check for blood in your stool. If blood is detected in your stool, you may have additional tests, such as colonoscopy (see page 767), an examination of the rectum and large intestine.\n\nA bone marrow biopsy is sometimes recommended to evaluate the body's iron reserves and to determine the cause of anemia. A bone marrow biopsy is done by passing a hollow needle into a bone—such as the back of the pelvic bone—and removing a small sample of marrow from inside the bone. Local anesthesia is used for the procedure. A bone marrow biopsy can confirm or rule out iron deficiency. It can also help determine other causes of poor red blood cell production, including drug toxicity, lead poisoning, or bone marrow diseases such as multiple myeloma (see page 627), leukemia (see page 621), or aplastic anemia (see page 628).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > *Treatment*]\nDoctors treat iron deficiency anemia by replacing the lost iron and treating the underlying condition that is causing the shortage of iron in the body. A doctor may prescribe iron supplements to take for several months or longer. (Take the supplements according to your doctor's instructions to avoid indigestion or other gastrointestinal symptoms.) The iron may darken your stool, which is normal. If you have problems taking the supplements, your doctor may inject the iron into a muscle or vein. Iron deficiency anemia usually clears up after a few weeks of treatment with supplemental iron. For severe anemia, a blood transfusion (see page 615) may be necessary.\n\nAfter y", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Iron", "relation": "is an essential component of", "tail": "hemoglobin"}, {"head": "iron", "relation": "is stored in the body and used to produce hemoglobin in new red blood cells", "tail": "the bone marrow"}, {"head": "lean red meat, green leafy vegetables, and whole-grain products", "relation": "replace", "tail": "the small amount of iron that is normally lost from the body"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "the bone marrow", "relation": "produces", "tail": "[Event: fewer and smaller red blood cells]"}, {"head": "anemia", "relation": "develops", "tail": "[Event: If the body loses more iron than it absorbs]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: anemia develops]", "relation": "can weaken the body's resistance to the effects of another illness or an injury", "tail": "[Event: life-threatening]"}, {"head": "[Event: If the body loses more iron than it absorbs]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: anemia develops]"}]}, "status": "success"}

In both disorders, a person's mouth or tongue may be sore and his or her skin may appear pale yellow. If the spinal cord is affected by vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, a person may have difficulty walking and maintaining his or her balance. He or she may feel continuous tingling or coldness in the hands and feet, and may experience memory loss, confusion, or depression. See your doctor right away if you have any of these symptoms.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have symptoms of vitamin deficiency anemia, your doctor will examine you and order blood tests to evaluate the level and appearance of your red blood cells. In vitamin deficiency anemia, the level of red blood cells is lower than normal and the red blood cells are larger than normal and underdeveloped. If you have anemia, your doctor\n\nwill probably order additional tests to determine the underlying cause. Tell the doctor if you have a close relative who has pernicious anemia.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > *Treatment*]\nOnce lost, the digestive tract can never regain the ability to absorb vitamin B12. For this reason, treatment of pernicious anemia and most other types of vitamin B12 deficiency involves taking vitamin B12 injections (which you can administer yourself) for the rest of your life. Initially, you inject vitamin B12 once a day; eventually you inject the vitamin once a month. Problems with walking and balance may take months to improve and, if you had these problems for a long time before beginning treatment, they may not clear up completely. If you stop taking vitamin B12, your symptoms will gradually return.\n\nTo treat folic acid deficiency anemia caused by a poor diet, by an inability of the intestines to absorb adequate amounts of the vitamin, or by a greater-than-normal biological need for folic acid, a doctor usually prescribes folic acid supplements. He or she will also recommend changes in the person's diet to take in adequate amounts of folic acid every day.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > *Preventing Vitamin Deficiency Anemia*]\nThe best way to prevent vitamin deficiency anemia is to eat a balanced diet that includes foods rich in vitamin B12 (such as lean red meat, low-fat or fat-free dairy products, and eggs) and folic acid (such as fresh fruits, orange juice, green leafy vegetables, and folic acid-fortified cereals and breads). Talk to your doctor about taking vitamin supplements.\n\nBecause smoking interferes with the body's ability to absorb vitamins and increases the risk of vitamin deficiency anemia, quit smoking (see page 29) if you smoke. Cutting back on your intake of alcohol also may improve your body's ability to absorb vital nutrients.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > **Sickle Cell Disease**]\nSickle cell disease is a life-threatening inherited form of hemolytic anemia (see page 616) in which hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells) is abnormal.\n\nPeople who inherit a sickle cell gene from both parents develop sickle cell disease. Their red blood cells contain the defective hemoglobin that gives the cells their abnormal, sickle shape. People who inherit a sickle cell gene from only one parent have sickle cell trait. Their red blood cells contain half normal hemoglobin and half defective hemoglobin. Although they will not develop the disease, they can pass the sickle cell gene to their children.\n\nIn sickle cell disease, the abnormal, sickle-shaped red blood cells are fragile and have difficulty flowing through the capillaries, the smallest blood vessels in the body. The defective cells tend to clog the capillaries, preventing blood (and oxygen) from reaching tissues and organs, which can lead to severe tissue and organ damage. In addition, the abnormal red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be replaced; this shortened life of red cells leads to iron deficiency anemia (see page 610).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > Sickle-shaped red blood cells]\nIn sickle cell disease, the body produces abnormal, sickle-shaped red blood cells (bottom). Normal red blood cells are doughnut-shaped (top). Healthy red blood cells flow easily through blood vessels, while sickle-shaped cells tend to block the capillaries (the smallest blood vessels in the body), significantly reducing the amount of oxygen that reaches the tissues.\n\n![Diagram illustrating normal red blood cells (top) and sickle-shaped red blood cells (bottom).

A transfusion consists of red blood cells if you have anemia (see page 610) or platelets (which enable blood to clot) if you have bleeding (thrombocytopenia; see page 620).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Blood Transfusions** > **Blood Donors**]\nAlthough researchers continue to look for ways to make synthetic blood substitutes, for now people who volunteer to be blood donors are the only sources of blood and blood products. AIDS has highlighted the importance of testing the blood of potential donors for bloodborne infectious organisms such as HIV, hepatitis B and C, malaria, and syphilis.\n\nBefore giving blood, all donors are given a blood test to make sure they don't have anemia. If their blood is found to be healthy, about 1 pint of blood is removed from one of their veins with a needle. This procedure takes about 10 to 20 minutes and is painless and safe. Giving blood does not expose a donor to HIV or any other disease-causing organism because new, sterile needles are used for each donor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Blood Transfusions** > **Having a blood transfusion**]\n![Illustration of a patient lying in a hospital bed receiving blood transfusion from a bag labeled 'Donor blood' via a catheter inserted into a vein.]()![](_page_1122_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nSelf-donation, also called autologous blood donation, is an alternative to using blood from donors. People can donate their own blood in the few weeks before they have a scheduled surgical procedure. During this time, their bone marrow makes new blood to replenish the supply. The donated blood may be stored and used during or after the surgery if needed. An autologous blood donation eliminates the problems of matching blood types and the risk of infections. In directed blood donations, people can select a donor, such as a relative or friend, who gives blood to be used specifically for them.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Blood Transfusions** > ***Blood Groups and Blood Matching***]\nTransfusions are safe and effective if the donor and recipient have compatible blood types. Blood is categorized into four main groups—A, B, AB, and O. In most blood groups, the surfaces of red blood cells are coated with specific proteins called antigens, which are labeled A or B. A person's blood cells have either A or B antigens (A or B blood group), both antigens (AB blood group), or neither antigen (O blood group). In the plasma, a person with A antigens has antibodies against B antigens and a person with B\n\nantigens has antibodies against A antigens, which cause a reaction when combined. People with type O blood do not have the A or B antigens to cause a reaction with other blood. For this reason, people with type O blood can donate their blood to people with any other group without causing a reaction. People with AB blood can safely receive A, B, or O blood. Other blood classifications, including Rhesus (Rh) factor (see page 508), are made to ensure a compatible match between donor and recipient.\n\nThe blood groups of donor blood are recorded on each unit of blood to make sure that a person having a transfusion gets the right type of blood. Before each transfusion, small quantities of the recipient's and the donor's blood are combined in the laboratory to ensure that they are compatible and that the transfusion is safe.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Thalassemia]\nThalassemia is a group of blood disorders caused by an inherited genetic defect that blocks the formation of hemoglobin A, the type of hemoglobin in the red blood cells of healthy adults. Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying protein in blood. Hemoglobin A is formed by a combination of four proteins—two alpha proteins and two beta proteins—that enable red blood cells to carry oxygen to tissues. Thalassemia is the most common blood disorder in the world, affecting mostly people from the Mediterranean, Middle East, Far East, and Africa. The effects of this recessive genetic disorder can range from mild to severe, depending on the particular genetic defect and whether a person inherits a defective gene from one or both parents.\n\nWhen thalassemia results from a defect in the production of the alpha protein, it is called alpha thalassemia. Because each parent provides two alpha protein genes, people with this form of thalassemia are usually not severely affected because the healthy two or three copies of the protein override the impact of the deficient ones.\n\nThe most serious form of the disorder, called beta thalassemia major, is caused by a deficiency or complete absence of the beta hemoglobin protein. Beta thalassemia major, which occurs when a child inherits a copy of the defective gene from both parents, causes severe anemia.

Your skin may be pale yellow and your urine may contain blood pigment that makes it look darker than usual. If red blood cells are destroyed prematurely over a period of years, gallstones (see page 793) often form from a buildup of bilirubin, a protein by-product of the breakdown of red blood cells.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nHemolytic anemia is diagnosed with blood tests that look for by-products of red blood cell damage such as bilirubin. Examination of the blood provides valuable information about the shape of the red blood cells, because many types of hemolysis produce abnormally shaped red cells. The spleen may be enlarged from working harder than usual. The blood may be tested for antibodies as well as abnormal types of hemoglobin such as those that occur in sickle cell disease or thalassemia (see previous page).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe treatment for some types of hemolytic anemia is a splenectomy, a surgical procedure to remove the spleen. Splenectomy may be used to treat hemolytic anemia caused by an errant immune response and the hereditary form of hemolytic anemia because the spleen produces the antibodies that destroy red blood cells and is the major site of red cell destruction. However, doctors frequently prescribe corticosteroid medications, which may eliminate the need for a splenectomy. Corticosteroids dampen the abnormal immune response that causes the spleen to produce antibodies against red blood cells. Corticosteroids also inhibit the abnormal destruction of red blood cells by the spleen and other parts of the immune system. Doctors may also prescribe immune-suppressing drugs to decrease the immune system's production of antibodies, which can mistakenly attack and destroy red blood cells. If hemolytic anemia is triggered by a medication a person is taking, the doctor will ask him or her to stop taking the drug.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Bleeding and Bruising]\nBleeding occurs when a blood vessel is damaged. If an internal blood vessel is injured, blood seeps into surrounding tissue and forms a bruise. When delicate blood vessels are just beneath the surface, such as in the nose, a minor injury or irritation can cause external bleeding. In most people, minor bleeding does not cause problems because three mechanisms in the body quickly act together to stop the bleeding. First, nearby blood vessels contract and restrict the flow of blood to the injured area. Platelets (cell fragments that enable blood to clot) then gather where the blood vessels are damaged and stick to the vessel walls and to each other to form a plug. Interlacing strands of a substance called fibrin form in the damaged area; blood cells become trapped in the fibrin mesh and form a blood clot that seals the wound and stops the bleeding.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Bleeding and Bruising > Bruising]\nIf blood from an internal injury seeps into surrounding tissue, it forms a bruise. Once the internal bleeding has stopped, white blood cells called monocytes go to the injured area and help break down the red blood cells, healing the bruise.\n\n![Diagram illustrating a cut in the skin resulting in a bruise and blood accumulation beneath the skin layer.]()![](_page_1127_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nIn most diseases in which abnormal bleeding occurs (such as hemophilia), one or more of the mechanisms that normally stop bleeding malfunction. Minor injuries can cause persistent or severe bleeding. In a person with hemophilia or another bleeding disorder, bleeding from a cut, which in most people stops within 5 or 10 minutes, may continue for hours or even days. A person with a bleeding disorder may have internal bleeding and bleeding in the joints that can cause severe pain and can damage the joints.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Hemophilia]\nHemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder in which the body does not produce an adequate supply of a protein called antihemophilic globulin (factor VIII), which is essential for proper blood clotting. The disorder usually affects males, but it is passed from one generation to the next by females who carry the gene. In the United States, about 1 in 10,000 males has hemophilia. Nearly 75 percent of people who have hemophilia have a family history of the disease. However, the remaining 25 percent are the first in their family to have the disease, which usually results from a mutation (spontaneous change) in their mother's genes.\n\nEffective treatments have greatly reduced the risk of disability and death from hemophilia. However, care must be taken to avoid serious injuries, which can be life-threatening for a person who has hemophilia.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nAlthough occasionally a male infant with hemophilia will have prolonged bleeding after circumcision, the symptoms of hemophilia usually don't", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "bilirubin", "relation": "forms", "tail": "gallstones"}, {"head": "red blood cells", "relation": "are destroyed", "tail": "prematurely"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

People who have von Willebrand's disease bruise easily, have recurring nosebleeds, and often bleed heavily from the gums\n\nafter brushing their teeth or during routine dental care. Rarely, bleeding after an injury also can occur inside the brain, which can be life-threatening.\n\nWomen who have the disorder have intense and prolonged menstrual periods that can last for weeks or months without stopping. Such uninterrupted bleeding can cause severe anemia (see page 610) and can interfere with a woman's ability to get pregnant or carry a pregnancy to full term. Women who have the disorder also have an increased risk of potentially severe hemorrhaging immediately after childbirth.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have symptoms of a bleeding disorder, your doctor will probably recommend that you see a hematologist (a doctor who specializes in treating diseases of the blood) to get an accurate diagnosis. After performing a physical examination and obtaining a detailed health history, the hematologist will ask you about any episodes of bleeding in close relatives. He or she will then order blood tests that measure platelet function, clotting factor function, and the levels of certain clotting factors in your blood. These tests are very sensitive and can be made inaccurate by several variables, including the menstrual cycle, the use of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that thin the blood, exercise, stress, and a cold environment. For this reason, the tests may need to be repeated before the doctor can confirm the diagnosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThere is no cure for von Willebrand's disease. Mild forms of the disease usually require no treatment other than routine instruction in first aid. For example, you may be shown how to apply pressure with your fingers to help a wound stop bleeding. For moderate or severe bleeding problems, a hematologist may prescribe a hormonal drug called desmopressin, which triggers the body to release the von Willebrand factor. The hormone can be taken by injection or in a nasal spray. People who do not respond to treatment with desmopressin may be given a transfusion of concentrated clotting factors (including von Willebrand factor) called cryoprecipitate.\n\nWomen who have heavy bleeding during menstrual periods may benefit from taking birth-control pills. The same hormones that are in birth-control pills can also be rubbed onto the skin or applied as a patch. For unknown reasons, pregnancy often reduces the symptoms of the bleeding disorder; however, immediately after delivery, the risk of bleeding can increase significantly.\n\nChildren who have von Willebrand's disease need to reduce their risk of injury by limiting or avoiding contact sports. Children who have the severe form of the disease may have to wear a protective helmet during most forms of physical activity.\n\nIf you know that you carry the gene for von Willebrand's disease, or if you already have a child who has the disorder, seek genetic counseling (see page 952).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Thrombocytopenia]\nThrombocytopenia results from the destruction or inadequate production of platelets (cell fragments that enable blood to clot). In thrombocytopenia, the blood contains too few platelets, causing prolonged bleeding when a person is injured.\n\nThrombocytopenia can have different causes. For example, it can result from taking some medications or from having radiation therapy (see page 23) or chemotherapy (see page 23) for cancer (which can inhibit the body's production of platelets). People who have Hodgkin's disease (see page 626) or lupus (see page 920) can develop thrombocytopenia from platelet destruction. Thrombocytopenia also can occur as a result of leukemia (see next page), when cancerous white blood cells crowd out platelet-forming blood cells.\n\nAcute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) usually occurs when, for unknown reasons, an immune system organ called the spleen forms antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) that mistakenly attack the platelets. In ITP, healthy platelets are damaged and removed from the bloodstream by the spleen at a high rate.\n\nDilutional thrombocytopenia can develop when a person has many blood transfusions in a short period of time, which can occur during surgery or when abnormal bleeding results from another blood disorder. In dilutional thrombocytopenia, the relative number of platelets in the blood can be reduced significantly.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nThe main symptom of thrombocytopenia is a rash of tiny bright red and dark red spots caused by bleeding in the skin.

If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor right away.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf your doctor suspects that you may have AML, he or she will examine you and will probably recommend blood tests and a bone marrow biopsy. For the biopsy, a sample of cells is withdrawn from your bone marrow through a needle and examined under a microscope for the presence of leukemia cells.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf you are diagnosed with AML, your doctor will immediately admit you to the hospital. Because the treatment for this type of leukemia is complicated and difficult, it is usually performed by an oncologist (a doctor who specializes in treating cancer) or a hematologist (a doctor who specializes in treating blood disorders). In the hospital, you will be given transfusions of red blood cells and platelets when you need them. Platelet transfusions are usually provided to prevent bleeding. If you develop a fever or other sign of infection, the doctor will identify the infectious agent and give you antibiotics intravenously (through a vein) to fight it.\n\nThe first stage of treatment for AML is chemotherapy (see page 23) to try to destroy the cancerous cells. After a few weeks of chemotherapy, your health should return to normal. Chemotherapy produces a remission (disappearance of symptoms) in about 50 to 80 percent of people, depending on their age at diagnosis. However, if treatment is stopped after this first course of chemotherapy, the remission will be brief and the leukemia will recur. A variety of treatment strategies are used during this postremission period, ranging from additional chemotherapy to high-dose chemotherapy followed by a stem cell transplant (see page 624), depending on the person's age and the unique biological characteristics of his or her leukemia. When given at this time, these treatments can prolong survival significantly.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia**]\nAcute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is characterized by an excess of infection-fighting white blood cells called lymphocytes in the blood and bone marrow. Lymphocytes originate in the bone marrow and other organs of the lymphatic system. In ALL,\n\nimmature lymphocytes, called lymphoblasts, do not develop into infection-fighting white blood cells as they should. Excessive numbers of these immature lymphocytes collect in the blood, bone marrow, and lymph tissues. If the cancerous cells crowd out other blood cells, including red blood cells (which carry oxygen) and platelets (which enable blood to clot), the bone marrow cannot produce these essential cells in adequate numbers. A deficiency of red blood cells can lead to anemia; a deficiency of platelets can lead to easy bleeding or bruising.\n\nThe cancerous lymphocytes can also spread to other organs, including the brain, and to the spinal cord. ALL progresses quickly and affects mostly children and young adults. The prognosis for a person with ALL depends on the person's age and general health, on the characteristics of the leukemia cells seen under a microscope, and on how well the cancer responds to treatment.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe early symptoms of ALL—fever, weakness, fatigue, aching in the bones or joints, and swollen lymph nodes—are similar to those of the flu and other common infections. See your doctor if you have any of these symptoms for more than 2 or 3 weeks.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nBecause symptoms in the early stages of ALL can resemble those of the flu, the disease can be difficult to diagnose. If you have persistent symptoms, your doctor may order blood tests to measure the levels of the different kinds of cells in your blood. If the results are abnormal, the doctor may recommend a bone marrow biopsy in which a small sample of your bone marrow is withdrawn through a needle inserted into a bone and the cells are studied under a microscope. The doctor may also recommend a lumbar puncture (see page 693), in which a needle is inserted through your back into the lower part of the spinal canal to withdraw a sample of cerebrospinal fluid; the fluid is studied under a microscope for the presence of cancerous cells. This information can help the doctor determine the type of leukemia and the best treatment.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Leukemia*]\nIn lymphocytic leukemias, white blood cells called lymphocytes have a genetic mutation that makes them abnormal.

Instead of maturing and dying in the natural way, the cancerous blood cells multiply and stay alive longer than they should. Gradually the leukemia cells crowd out healthy white blood cells in the lymph glands and bone marrow, reducing the immune system's ability to fight infections. The leukemia cells can overflow into the bloodstream and from there into the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and other parts of the body. As the number of leukemia cells in the bone marrow rises, they increasingly interfere with the ability of the marrow to produce healthy new blood cells. This reduction in the number of healthy blood cells can lead to a variety of problems, including anemia (see page 610), susceptibility to infections, and bleeding.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia > *Symptoms*]\nCLL often produces no symptoms at first and is usually discovered by a blood test done for another reason.

If a blood test shows abnormal cells, you will have further testing, such as a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, to determine the type of leukemia. In a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, a sample of bone marrow is withdrawn with a needle from one of your large bones (such as the hip) and examined under a microscope.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia > Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Transplants]\nIf a closely matched donor is available, a stem cell or bone marrow transplant with very high-dose chemotherapy offers a chance for a cure for some types of cancer and other diseases. Bone marrow is spongy tissue inside the large bones that contains stem cells, which make all the different types of blood cells in the body. The tissue or cells can be taken either from the patient (an autologous transplant) or from a closely matched donor (an allogeneic transplant). A sibling's tissue is usually the best match, but bone marrow registries can often find unrelated donors who may be good matches for transplants.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia > *Stem Cell Transplants*]\nFor an allogeneic stem cell transplant, stem cells can be collected from the donor's bloodstream using a procedure called apheresis. In apheresis, blood is drawn from the donor with a needle and syringe and put through a machine that collects stem cells from the blood and infuses the rest of the blood back into the person through another vein. Alternatively, stem cells can be taken directly from the bone marrow while the donor is under general anesthesia.\n\nBefore receiving the collected stem cells (either your own or those from a donor), you will be given massive doses of chemotherapy (see page 23), perhaps along with radiation therapy (see page 23), to destroy all the cancerous cells in your body.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia > *Bone Marrow Transplants*]\nA bone marrow transplant is used to replace diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow. For an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (which uses bone marrow from a compatible donor), all the bone marrow in your body is first destroyed with high doses of chemotherapy, perhaps along with radiation therapy. Healthy marrow that has been taken from the donor is injected through a needle into one of your veins to replace the bone marrow that was destroyed.\n\nFor an autologous bone marrow transplant, some of your bone marrow is taken from you, treated with powerful drugs to kill the cancer cells, and frozen until it is needed. You are then given high-dose chemotherapy (and possibly radiation therapy) to destroy all of your remaining bone marrow. After thawing your frozen, treated bone marrow, the doctor injects it back into your body through a needle into a vein to replace your destroyed, cancerous marrow.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia > *After a Stem Cell or Bone Marrow Transplant*]\nImmediately after the stem cell or bone marrow transplant or intensive chemotherapy, you will have virtually no white blood cells and therefore no ability to fight infections. Because of this, you will be placed in a germ-free environment to avoid the possibility of infection.

The cancer can develop in a single lymph node, a group of lymph nodes, or in other parts of the lymphatic system, such as the bone marrow or spleen. Hodgkin's disease is most common in adolescents and young adults and in people over age 50.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptom of Hodgkin's disease is persistent swollen glands, usually in the neck, armpit, or groin. Other possible symptoms include fever, sweating, fatigue, weakness, weight loss, and itching. See your doctor immediately if you have any unexplained swellings—Hodgkin's disease responds well to early treatment.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have symptoms of Hodgkin's disease, your doctor will probably take samples of your blood and remove one of your swollen glands for examination. If these evaluations show that you have Hodgkin's disease, you will need to have tests to determine the extent of the cancer. For example, you may have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, in which a small amount of bone marrow is removed through a needle and syringe and\n\nexamined under a microscope. Other tests may include a chest X-ray, an MRI (see page 113), a CT scan (see page 112), a gallium scan, or a PET scan (see page 114).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > *Treatment*]\nIf you have Hodgkin's disease, your treatment will depend on the results of your diagnostic tests and the form of Hodgkin's you have. Radiation therapy is often used to treat Hodgkin's disease at an early stage. Radiation therapy can have a success rate higher than 90 percent for some forms of Hodgkin's disease in young people. However, many doctors recommend a combination of chemotherapy drugs for most stages of Hodgkin's disease. Occasionally, both chemotherapy and radiation therapy are recommended.\n\nIf the cancer is at an advanced stage when it is detected, combination chemotherapy is given. Combination chemotherapy can cure the majority of cases of Hodgkin's disease. Radiation therapy is sometimes given after chemotherapy to eliminate specific areas of disease. The entire course of treatment usually takes about 6 months. High-dose chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant (see page 624) are recommended for people whose Hodgkin's disease returns after treatment or whose disease has not responded completely to other treatments. Once your treatment is completed, you will need to have regular checkups for several years to make sure the cancer has not returned and to watch for any long-term complications of the chemotherapy or radiation therapy, such as heart disease, thyroid disease, lung cancer, or breast cancer.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > Disorders of the Bone Marrow]\nThe marrow inside your bones is an active tissue with a rich blood supply. Blood cells inside the bone marrow, called stem cells, make all the different types of blood cells in the body, including red cells (which deliver oxygen to tissues), platelets (which enable blood to clot), and white cells (which fight infection). Blood that flows through the marrow moves the newly produced blood cells into the bloodstream. In adults, active blood-forming marrow is found only in the bones of the trunk. The marrow inside the bones of the arms and legs is fatty and, in adults, is usually inactive, but it can become active and produce new blood cells when necessary. In young children, all the bones have active, blood-forming marrow. Disorders of the bone marrow\n\nsuch as polycythemia and aplastic anemia can affect all types of blood cells, while disorders such as multiple myeloma and agranulocytosis affect only one type of blood cell.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Multiple Myeloma]\nMultiple myeloma is a cancer that affects plasma cells, a type of white blood cell in blood and bone marrow. Plasma cells produce proteins called antibodies to fight infections. Normally, plasma cells make up only a small percentage of the cells in the marrow but, if a plasma cell undergoes genetic changes that cause it to multiply excessively, the result is a cancer called multiple myeloma. The overproduction of plasma cells inside the marrow disrupts the production of red blood cells (which deliver oxygen to tissues). This disruption in red blood cell production can lead to anemia (see page 610). The antibodies produced by the cancerous plasma cells can accumulate and injure the kidneys. This accumulation of plasma cells usually overtakes the production of normal infection-fighting antibodies by healthy plasma cells. The excess of plasma cells can cause painful destruction of bone.\n\nMultiple myeloma makes up about 10 percent of all blood cancers but, for unknown reasons, appears to be increasing in the United States. The cancer affects mostly people over 50 and is slightly more common in men than in women and is more common in blacks than in people of other races.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptom", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Hodgkin's disease", "relation": "arises from", "tail": "white blood cells"}, {"head": "Hodgkin's disease", "relation": "develops in", "tail": "lymph node"}, {"head": "Hodgkin's disease", "relation": "most common in", "tail": "adolescents and young adults"}, {"head": "Hodgkin's disease", "relation": "most common in", "tail": "people over age 50"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "you", "relation": "have", "tail": "[Event: unexplained swellings]"}, {"head": "you", "relation": "see your doctor immediately if you have any", "tail": "[Event: unexplained swellings]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: early treatment]", "relation": "responds well to", "tail": "[Event: Hodgkin's disease]"}, {"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment]"}]}, "status": "success"}

You also may have severe itching that worsens when you take a hot bath. The condition can also cause enlargement of the spleen (an organ of the immune system that stores red blood cells and platelets), which a doctor can feel during a physical examination. Secondary polycythemia can cause headache, lethargy, and elevated blood pressure.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose polycythemia, a doctor performs a physical examination and will probably recommend a blood test that measures the number of red cells in the blood or that compares the relative amounts of red blood cells and plasma (the fluid in which blood cells are suspended). He or she may also recommend measuring the level of erythropoietin (a protein in the blood that enhances the formation of red blood cells). You may need to have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy (removal of cells from the bone marrow through a needle and syringe for examination under a microscope) to rule out other disorders.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf you have polycythemia vera, you may be able to have treatment on an outpatient basis. The first goal of treatment is to lower the number of red cells in your blood, thereby reducing the thickness of your blood and your risk of developing blood clots or sludged blood, which can block blood flow. About a pint of blood is taken regularly from a vein\n\nin your arm. The frequency of blood removal (phlebotomy) is based on how long the number of red blood cells stays at a healthy level.\n\nDrugs are sometimes used to control the overproduction of red blood cells. These drugs are usually taken by mouth for months to years, depending on how well they control blood cell production. Rarely, doctors recommend injections of radioactive phosphorus to reduce the number of red blood cells in the blood. Drugs are usually used only for people who cannot have their blood drawn regularly or for whom blood removal alone has not been effective in maintaining a healthy balance of red blood cells.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Aplastic Anemia**]\nIf you have aplastic anemia, your bone marrow's production of blood cells decreases, causing a gradual or sudden reduction in the total number of cells in your bloodstream. In most cases of aplastic anemia, the cause cannot be identified. Sometimes it can be traced to exposure to radiation or a toxic substance such as benzene or to taking a particular medication. Many cases are thought to result from an overactive immune system that inhibits the ability of the bone marrow to produce blood cells. The condition may improve spontaneously or with treatment, but progressive failure of the bone marrow can also occur, making the condition worse.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nAplastic anemia has three main groups of symptoms. The decrease in the production of red blood cells causes the symptoms of iron deficiency anemia (see page 610). The decrease in the production of granulocytes, a type of infection-fighting white blood cell, makes you more susceptible to infections. The decrease in the production of platelets (cell fragments that enable blood to clot) causes the bleeding disorder thrombocytopenia (see page 620), which leads to easy bruising, red spots on the skin, and bleeding from the nose, mouth, and other areas. The bleeding may be severe enough to become life-threatening. If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor right away.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have symptoms of aplastic anemia, your doctor will probably ask you to have a blood test. If the test results show that you may have aplastic anemia, you may need to have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, in which a small amount of your bone marrow is removed through a needle and syringe and examined under a microscope. A bone marrow biopsy usually enables a doctor to make a definite diagnosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf you have aplastic anemia that has resulted from taking a medication for another condition, your doctor will ask you to stop taking the medication and will prescribe a substitute drug. If there is a possibility of continuing exposure to a toxic substance at your workplace or at home, you need to eliminate the toxic substance from your environment; you may need to change jobs or move to another home.\n\nYour doctor will probably treat the anemia and bleeding with blood transfusions and will treat infections with antibiotics, which are usually given intravenously (through a vein). If your condition doesn't improve within a few weeks, your doctor will prescribe medication to stimulate your bone marrow to produce blood cells.

The pleura serves as a cover for the lungs and the inner surface of the rib cage and diaphragm (the sheet of muscle that arches into your chest cavity and separates the cavity from your abdomen). A tiny space called the pleural space between the two layers of the pleura contains a small amount of fluid that allows the two layers to slide easily against each other when you breathe.\n\n![Diagram of the human chest showing the lungs, bronchi, ribs, pleura, and pleural space. An inset magnifies the pleural space showing the pleura and pleural space, highlighting the location of the bronchial tube.]()![](_page_1152_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nDeep in the chest, the trachea divides into two main tubes called bronchi. Each bronchus leads to a lung, where the bronchus divides into smaller air passages called bronchioles. At the tip of each bronchiole are clusters of balloonlike structures called alveoli; the lungs contain about 300 million alveoli. The exchange of oxygen for carbon dioxide occurs through tiny blood vessels in the thin walls of the alveoli.\n\nThe body uses several muscles to draw air into the lungs. The diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle attached to the lower ribs that separates the chest cavity from the abdomen. When the diaphragm contracts (along with other muscles between the ribs), the contraction creates a mild vacuum inside your lungs, causing the lungs to expand and draw air into the respiratory tract. When the muscles that help draw air into the lungs relax, the lungs spring back, forcing the air back out of the lungs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Nose]\nThe nose is the uppermost part of the respiratory tract. Protective hairs just inside the nose trap large dust particles and other debris. A mucous membrane that contains many tiny blood vessels lines the nose. This lining cleans, moistens, and warms the air you breathe as it goes through the nasal passage toward your throat and lungs. The nasal passage is winding rather than straight, running along the top of the palate (the roof of the mouth) and turning down toward the throat. In several places, the nasal passage opens into sinuses (air-filled cavities in bones of the skull).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Respiration > How you breathe]\nWhen you breathe in, your diaphragm is pulled down and flattened (top left). The muscles between your ribs may also contract and pull your rib cage upward and outward (top right), expanding and drawing air into your lungs. The stronger this muscle action is, the more air that enters your lungs. Your breathing rate is determined by the amount of carbon dioxide expelled from your bloodstream. When you breathe out, your chest muscles and diaphragm relax (bottom left), making your rib cage sink (bottom right) and your lungs contract and squeeze out air.\n\nDiagram illustrating the mechanics of breathing.\n\n**Breathing in:**\n\n- The Diaphragm pulls down.\n- The Rib cage pulls up and out.\n\n**Breathing out:**\n\n- The Diaphragm relaxes.\n- The Rib cage pulls down and in.\n\n![](_page_1154_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Respiration > Cross section of the nose]\nThe nasal passage is linked to sinuses, which are air-filled cavities in the skull. The sensitive hairlike endings of the olfactory nerves project into the nasal passage. The olfactory nerves detect odors in the air and pass the information to the olfactory bulb, which transmits the information to the brain (which recognizes or perceives the odors).\n\n![Diagram illustrating the nasal cavity and surrounding structures. Labeled parts include: Frontal sinus, Olfactory bulb, Olfactory nerve, Nasal passage, and Sphenoidal sinus.]()![](_page_1155_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Nasal Polyps]\nNasal polyps are benign (noncancerous) growths of the mucous membrane that lines the nose. They protrude into the nasal cavity. Polyps result from an immune response that triggers fluid buildup and swelling in the lining of the nose. Nasal polyps develop most frequently in people who have chronic conditions such as asthma (see page 640) that cause recurring inflammation in the nasal cavity or in people who are sensitive to aspirin.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Nasal Polyps > *Symptoms*]\nNasal polyps don't always cause symptoms. If they are large or numerous, they can obstruct the nasal passages, making breathing through the nose difficult and impairing your sense of smell and taste. You may have a headache or pain in your face if they cause an infection and block the opening between the nasal cavity and one of the sinuses.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Nasal Polyps > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have nasal polyps that are near the front of your nose, you may be able to see them in a mirror by shining a light up your nostrils.

Breathing can cease for 20 seconds or more, sometimes becoming so inadequate that the person's skin turns blue because of the lack of oxygen. As blood oxygen levels drop, the person may stir enough to take some normal breaths (but does not fully wake up). After some normal breathing, the person falls back asleep. This cycle can repeat itself 20 to 30 times an hour each night.\n\nThe most common type of sleep apnea, called obstructive sleep apnea, is caused by an overly relaxed or sagging base of the tongue, uvula (the small piece of tissue that hangs from the middle of the back of the throat), or soft palate (roof of the mouth). These sagging tissues obstruct air flow to and from the person's windpipe. Using alcohol or sleeping pills worsens sleep apnea by making the airway tissue more likely to sag during sleep. In the less common type of sleep apnea called central sleep apnea, the brain fails to send the required signals to the breathing muscles to continue regular inhalation and exhalation during sleep.\n\nSleep apnea occurs in people of all ages, including children, and is more common in men than in women. Overweight people are most likely to develop sleep apnea, although with age the connection between sleep apnea and obesity is less pronounced. Other people who are at risk for sleep apnea include those who have a structural abnormality of the nose or throat or other parts of the upper airway. The disorder seems to run in families. It has been linked to some cases of sudden infant death syndrome (see page 388). People with sleep apnea are often totally unaware that they have the disorder. Their family or friends suspect sleep apnea after hearing excessive snoring or seeing the person struggle to breathe during sleep.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nPeople who have sleep apnea snore loudly between pauses in breathing (although not everyone who snores has sleep apnea) and may experience choking sensations or awaken with shortness of breath. The disorder often causes early morning headaches and daytime sleepiness. Chronic lack of sleep from sleep apnea may cause depression, irritability, learning and memory difficulties, and sexual problems. Sleep deprivation also places a person at risk of vehicle collisions and work-related accidents.\n\nSleep apnea can cause the heart to beat irregularly. It can contribute to high blood pressure and heart failure because the heart beats harder in the long term trying to make up for the chronically low oxygen levels. In people who already have heart disease (see page 558), sleep apnea can contribute to heart attacks.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Snoring]\nSnoring occurs when tissue at the back of your throat—the tonsils, adenoids, back of the tongue, or uvula—vibrates as air travels over it while you breathe during sleep. When this tissue becomes enlarged or when it develops poor muscle tone (which often results from excessive, long-term alcohol consumption), snoring is more likely to occur. Swollen and inflamed nasal passages resulting from a cold or allergies can also cause temporary snoring. Most snoring is not serious, but heavy or loud snoring can be a sign of sleep apnea.\n\nIf your snoring disrupts your sleep or the sleep of other people, see your doctor. The remedy may be as simple as changing your sleep position or raising the head of your bed. Losing weight may also help. Taking sleeping\n\npills, drinking alcohol, or smoking can cause the tissue at the back of your throat to relax during sleep, increasing the chances that you will snore.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nBecause disturbed sleep can have many causes, doctors use two specific tests to diagnose sleep apnea and determine its severity. Both are conducted overnight in a sleep center. The first test, polysomnography, measures a variety of body functions during sleep, including eye movement, muscle activity, the electrical activity of the brain, heart rate, and blood oxygen levels. Polysomnography also indicates when the person enters and leaves different stages of sleep. The second test, the multiple sleep latency test, determines how fast the person falls asleep. In general, people take an average of 10 to 20 minutes to fall asleep, but people with sleep apnea tend to fall asleep within 5 minutes. Because the multiple sleep latency test is conducted periodically over the course of a day, the doctor can also find out the degree of daytime sleepiness of a person with sleep apnea.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nPeople whose sleep apnea is mild often benefit from lifestyle changes, such as losing weight and avoiding alcohol and sleeping pills. Some people with mild sleep apnea have breathing pauses only when they lie on their back. Learning to sleep on their side often improves the condition.

Hoarseness is usually the only symptom, although papillomas can also cause difficulty breathing. Hoarseness caused by noncancerous tumors can be intermittent or continuous, while hoarseness caused by a cancerous tumor is always continuous and gets worse over time. If a tumor is cancerous and allowed to grow, it can eventually make swallowing difficult. The cancer may eventually spread to lymph nodes in the neck, producing an obvious lump in the neck. Do not ignore changes in your voice that occur for no obvious reason. If you are hoarse for more than a week or have hoarseness that recurs, see your doctor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf, after examining your throat, your doctor rules out inflammation from laryngitis, he or she will refer you to an otolaryngologist (an ear, nose, and throat specialist) for a more thorough examination of your larynx. If the otolaryngologist sees signs of a growth, he or she will probably schedule an outpatient procedure called endoscopy. During the endoscopy, he or she will insert a viewing tube (laryngoscope) through your mouth to the larynx and will take a sample of cells from the larynx for examination under a microscope to determine if the growth is cancerous.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nVoice-retraining therapy can help relieve pressure on the vocal cords, sometimes causing nodules to shrink enough to stop causing symptoms such as hoarseness. Polyps and nodules can go away on their own, but sometimes a surgeon may need to remove them. If you have surgery, you will be given general anesthesia. The doctor uses an operating microscope to magnify the area, making it easier for him or her to see and remove the abnormal tissue. Papillomas can recur after surgery and may need to be removed several times.\n\nMalignant tumors that are detected early can be successfully treated either with radiation therapy (see page 23) or by removing part of the larynx. With either of these treatments, total loss of voice is rare (the voice is usually preserved at least partially). In advanced cancer, the entire larynx may be removed or the person may be given chemotherapy (see page 23) along with radiation therapy (called chemoradiation) to eliminate the cancerous cells. Even in relatively advanced cases, the chances for a cure are good.\n\nIf the surgeon removes your entire larynx, different types of therapies are available to help you regain your speech. With the help of a speech therapist, you may learn how to use your esophagus to speak. Or you may be able to learn to use a special vibrating device that you manipulate with your tongue and teeth to produce the sounds of speech. In some cases, a surgeon implants a valve between the trachea and esophagus (see illustration below) to divert air from the lungs into the esophagus to produce the sounds of speech.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > **Speaking without your larynx**]\nSurgery can enable you to speak after having your larynx removed by creating a system to produce speech sounds. The surgeon makes a small hole in your neck into your trachea. He or she then implants a valve between the trachea and esophagus. When you want to speak, you place a finger over the hole in the trachea. Blocking the opening in the trachea allows air from your lungs to pass through the new valve, which makes the pharynx vibrate to produce sound.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the human respiratory system, showing the Trachea, Esophagus, Throat, and a Valve mechanism near the larynx. A finger points to a 'Hole in neck into trachea'.]()![](_page_1164_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Lungs and Chest]\nYour two lungs lie on either side of the central cavity of the chest. The upper tips of the lungs are slightly above the collarbone. The bottom surfaces of the lungs rest on the diaphragm, a sheet of muscle that arches up into the chest cavity and completely separates the chest cavity from the abdomen.\n\nThe bronchi are the main airways that branch into each lung from the trachea. They divide into smaller and smaller airways called bronchioles. Each bronchiole ends in a cluster of tiny air sacs called alveoli. Each lung contains about 150 million alveoli. Each alveolus contains several minute blood vessels called capillaries. The walls of the capillaries are thin enough to allow oxygen and carbon dioxide (a waste product from body processes) to move between the air and the blood. The alveoli transfer oxygen from the air you breathe to your blood, which transports the oxygen to all tissues in your body. Your blood releases carbon dioxide into your lungs and you exhale it.

He or she will examine you, including listening to your lungs with a stethoscope, and may recommend lung function tests such as peak flow monitoring (see page 647) to measure the breathing capacity of your lungs and to help confirm the diagnosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > Asthma attack]\nAn asthma attack results when the smooth muscle wall of the airways is swollen from inflammation and becomes constricted, obstructing the airways. Breathing becomes difficult and the body gets less oxygen.\n\n![Diagram illustrating a healthy bronchiole and a bronchiole during an asthma attack. The healthy bronchiole shows an open air passage and a muscle wall. The bronchiole during an asthma attack shows a constricted, obstructed air passage and a swollen muscle wall.]()![](_page_1168_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > WARNING! > What to Do if You Are Having an Asthma Attack]\nIf you are having an asthma attack, use your inhaler or nebulizer correctly. If you do not get relief in 30 minutes, call your doctor. He or she may recommend that you try the inhaler or nebulizer again. If you still are having symptoms, get medical attention immediately—call 911 or your local emergency number.\n\nAn allergy that may trigger asthma is diagnosed by skin or blood tests. In the skin prick test, small amounts of the possible allergen are placed on your skin, and your skin is pricked. If you are allergic to the substance, your skin will react (usually with itching, redness, and mild swelling). Blood tests measure the levels of antibodies the body produces in response to suspected allergens. Blood tests are recommended for\n\ndiagnosing asthma in people who are not able to take the skin prick test (either because they cannot stop taking antihistamines or because they have skin rashes—both of which interfere with the results of skin tests) and in people who are at risk of having a severe reaction from a skin test. Your doctor will decide which method is best for you.\n\nIn making a diagnosis, doctors classify asthma into the following four general forms:\n\n- **Mild intermittent asthma** People with mild intermittent asthma have symptoms less often than twice a week, and nighttime symptoms less often than twice a month. Their lung function test results (see page 647) are in the normal range.\n- **Mild persistent asthma** People with mild persistent asthma have symptoms more often than twice a week, and nighttime symptoms more often than twice a month. Their lung function test results are in the normal range.\n- **Moderate persistent asthma** People with moderate persistent asthma have symptoms every day, and nighttime symptoms more often than once a week. Their lung function test results are slightly abnormal, which indicates that their lung function is decreased.\n- **Severe persistent asthma** People with severe persistent asthma have symptoms continuously throughout the day (even with little physical activity), and frequent nighttime symptoms. Their lung function test results are substantially abnormal, which indicates that their lung function is decreased.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nAsthma has no cure, but it can be controlled; the obstruction to airflow that occurs in asthma is at least partly reversible. Your first step in treatment is to try to identify the triggers that are causing your asthma. Keep a diary of your symptoms and review it regularly with your doctor. It can help your doctor determine treatment. Once you have identified an allergen or situation that triggers your asthma, the best course is to avoid exposure to that substance or any substance that could irritate your lungs.\n\nAsthma treatment is based on the severity of the disease. Asthma medications are categorized into long-term-control medications (used to achieve and maintain control over time) and quick-relief medications (used to treat acute asthma attacks). These medications are often used in various combinations. Inhalers and nebulizers allow you to breathe the medication directly into your lungs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Inhalers and Nebulizers]\nInhalers and nebulizers are devices that help deliver asthma medication directly", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "asthma", "relation": "treats", "tail": "symptoms"}, {"head": "asthma", "relation": "causes", "tail": "wheezing"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "you", "relation": "have", "tail": "[Event: asthma attack]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "hear", "tail": "[Event: wheezing through stethoscope]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "write down", "tail": "[Event: symptoms occurred]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: severe asthma attack]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: sweating profusely]"}, {"head": "[Event: increased pulse rate]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: anxiety]"}]}, "status": "success"}

You should be able to exercise and play a sport if your asthma is well controlled and you take a few precautions. Nearly 10 percent of Olympic athletes have asthma.\n\nMake sure that your coach, trainer, and others you exercise with know you have asthma. They may need to help you if you have an attack while exercising. Make up a plan of action (with your doctor's input) to follow if you have an attack. Review the plan with your trainer and teammates.\n\nUsing your inhaler immediately before exercising will help prevent an asthma attack. Warming up for at least 15 to 20 minutes before more vigorous exercise and cooling down gradually for 15 to 20 minutes afterward can also help decrease your risk of having an attack. Avoid exercising in cold air whenever possible because breathing in cold air can trigger asthma attacks.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pregnancy and asthma]\nDuring your pregnancy, your doctor will monitor your condition carefully. Poorly controlled asthma may decrease the amount of oxygen that gets to the fetus and limit the fetus's growth and chances for survival. Many of the medications used to treat asthma are safe to use during pregnancy, but talk to your doctor about which medications are\n\nbest for you. If you become pregnant while taking asthma medication, do not stop taking it without talking to your doctor first. Almost all asthma drugs are safe for the fetus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Preventing Asthma Attacks*]\nAvoiding the substances, situations, or conditions that trigger your asthma is your first line of defense. Here are some steps to take to minimize contact with common asthma triggers:\n\n- Avoid exposure to smoke from cigarettes and cigars. Smoke in the environment at home or work can be a major trigger for asthma. People who have asthma, especially children, should live in smoke-free homes.\n- Reduce the amount of dust in your home. Do not sweep (sweeping spreads dust around), and have someone who does not have asthma do the vacuuming. Eliminate rugs or carpets. Use washable window coverings, and wash them frequently. Dust and damp-mop your floors once a week.\n- Don't have a pet, especially one with fur or feathers. If you already have a pet, don't allow it in the bedroom. Keep it outdoors if possible.\n- Don't use strong chemicals for cleaning; avoid insecticide sprays and perfumed air fresheners.\n- Replace feather pillows and comforters with those filled with nonallergenic material. Enclose pillows, mattresses, and box springs in covers that will keep out dust mites.\n- Prevent cockroach and other insect infestations. Wash dishes and remove food from drains before going to bed. Store food and garbage inside sealed containers. Don't leave unwrapped food out on tables or counters. Wash your pet's food and water dishes nightly. Clean litter boxes daily.\n- Limit the time you spend outdoors on days when the pollen or mold count is high. Use an air conditioner and a clean-air machine to decrease your exposure to irritants in the air.\n- In cold weather, wear a scarf around your mouth or an air-warming mask (available at pharmacies) to warm air before you breathe it in. Avoid exercising outdoors in cold weather.\n- Vent your furnace to the outside. Avoid wood-burning fireplaces.\n- Get a flu shot (see page 650) every year, and get a vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia (see page 145) as often as your doctor recommends. Avoid contact with anyone who is sick with a cold or the flu.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pneumothorax]\nPneumothorax is partial or total collapse of a lung that occurs when air gets between the two layers of the pleura (the membrane that covers the lungs and lines the chest cavity). The pleura keeps your chest cavity airtight. When a lung collapses, air is squeezed out. The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide cannot occur because air cannot move into or out of the collapsed part of the lung. Usually, pneumothorax results from a congenital (present at birth) blister on the surface of the lung or from a blister that develops as a result of a disorder such as emphysema (see page 656). The blister ruptures and lets air seep between the pleural membranes. A small rupture usually is not noticeable and will heal on its own. But sometimes a large amount of air enters the space and causes a large portion of the lung to collapse.\n\nIn a potentially fatal condition called tension pneumothorax, air cannot escape from the pleural space and begins to accumulate there. The air squeezes the healthy lung and may squeeze the veins in the chest, preventing blood from returning to the heart. Pneumothorax occurs primarily in otherwise healthy young women for unknown reasons or in older men and women who have damaged lungs from disorders such as emphysema or asthma (see previous article).

Many of these substances can damage the respiratory tract or cause lung diseases. The sources of some occupational lung diseases (such as inhaling a toxic gas that instantly makes breathing difficult) are obvious. Other causes, such as exposure to asbestos (an insulating building material) or coal dust, can take 10 to 25 years to cause disease. Pneumoconiosis (dust lung) is the name for lung diseases that occur from long-term exposure to metallic or mineral dusts such as asbestos (asbestosis), beryllium (berylliosis), coal (coal miners' lung, also called black lung disease), and silica (silicosis).\n\nIf your lungs are repeatedly exposed to harmful substances, the chronic inflammation can lead to permanent scarring of lung tissue and potentially fatal respiratory failure (see right) and congestive heart failure (see page 570). Exposure to some substances increases your risk of lung cancer, especially if you smoke cigarettes.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nBreathing in toxic substances can cause the following symptoms in the lungs: fluid buildup, bleeding, inflammation, scarring (fibrosis), and a dry cough or a cough that produces phlegm. The phlegm of coal miners is often black. An affected person may\n\nhave breathlessness that goes away after a few hours or difficulty breathing that becomes progressively worse. Molecules from inhaled fumes can enter the bloodstream and cause other symptoms, such as fever with chills or a headache.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > Respiratory Failure]\nIf you have symptoms of respiratory failure or congestive heart failure (such as swelling of the ankles and legs, bluish skin color, sweating, wheezing, or severe difficulty breathing), get to a hospital emergency department as soon as possible. Treatment includes helping you breathe with the aid of a ventilator, supplemental oxygen, and medication.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you are continuously exposed to hazardous substances (or think you may have been) and have symptoms, your doctor will recommend that you have diagnostic tests such as a chest X-ray and lung function tests (see page 647) to see if, and how severely, your lungs are affected.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > *Treatment*]\nIf you have an occupational lung disease, change jobs if possible. If you can't change jobs, try to avoid the toxic material or fumes. Avoid unventilated areas. Wear a canister face mask while working. If you smoke, stop (see page 29). Smoking increases your risk of developing other lung disorders.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > **Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis**]\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, also called interstitial pulmonary fibrosis or fibrosing alveolitis, is an inflammatory disorder that results in thickening and scarring of the fibrous tissue of the lungs. Over time, this scarring can accumulate to such an extent that the lungs can no longer provide sufficient oxygen to the body. The disorder affects men\n\nand women in equal numbers and is usually diagnosed between ages 40 and 70. Although the cause is unknown, some doctors think that it may result from an autoimmune response (in which the immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues), a lung infection (usually a viral infection), taking certain medications, or undergoing radiation therapy (see page 23) for breast cancer. In some cases, heredity seems to be a factor. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may lead to other conditions, such as respiratory failure (see previous page) or congestive heart failure (see page 570).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis include a dry cough and shortness of breath, especially during exertion. Enlargement or clubbing of the fingertips develops in most people. As the disease progresses, you may have symptoms of respiratory failure or congestive heart failure such as swelling of the ankles and legs, bluish skin color, or wheezing and breathlessness.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and to help determine the type you have, your doctor may recommend diagnostic imaging tests such as a chest X-ray or a CT scan (see page 112). He or she also may recommend a blood test to determine the level of oxygen in your blood. The only sure way to diagnose idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is by examining tissue or phlegm samples from the lungs, usually obtained in a procedure called bronchoscopy (see page 661) or through an endoscope inserted into the pleural cavity through a skin incision.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThere is no effective treatment for 90 percent of the cases of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

If your doctor suspects you have lung cancer or if the X-ray shows signs of a possible tumor, he or she will probably recommend more diagnostic tests such as a CT scan (see page 112). He or she will also examine phlegm or tissue samples from your lungs to see if they contain cancerous cells. These biopsy samples are obtained by bronchoscopy (see page 661), needle aspiration (in which tissue samples are removed from the lungs using a needle and syringe), or surgery.\n\nThe biopsy surgery usually can be done through three small incisions in the side of the chest in a procedure called video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). In VATS, a doctor inserts a tube (with a camera and light attached) through one of the incisions into the space between the lungs and the chest wall. The camera sends an image to a monitor that the doctor uses as a guide to take biopsy samples using instruments inserted through the other two incisions.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosis > Lung Function Tests]\nLung function tests (also called pulmonary function tests or spirometry) are a series of tests used to diagnose and monitor respiratory problems. These tests, which are administered by technicians, measure the amount of air the lungs hold, how effectively the lungs work, and the maximum air flow in a person's breathing.\n\n- **Forced vital capacity** Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) measure the total volume of air exhaled (the FVC test) and the volume of air exhaled in 1 second (the FEV<sub>1</sub> test) using a spirometer. To measure FVC or FEV<sub>1</sub>, you inhale and then exhale into the spirometer as hard and as quickly as you can for as long as you can. You repeat each test three times; the highest readings are your FVC or FEV<sub>1</sub> values. Your spirometer readings are compared with values based on age, sex, and body size from a standard table. FEV<sub>1</sub> is normally 75 to 80 percent of FVC.\n\n- **Peak expiratory flow** Peak expiratory flow (PEF) measures the degree of narrowing of your airways using a handheld device called a peak flow meter. To measure PEF, you inhale and then exhale into the meter as hard as you can. You do this three times; the highest reading is your PEF value. The result is normal if the highest value is 80 percent of the normal predicted value. This test is less accurate than FEV<sub>1</sub>.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosis > *Treatment*]\nIf you have lung cancer, stop smoking now (see page 29). Doing so may help slow or even stop the growth of the tumor. The treatment of lung cancer depends on the type of\n\ncancer, the location and size of the tumor, and your age and general health. Surgical removal of the tumor is the most effective treatment if the cancer is not too advanced and if you have no other health problems such as chronic bronchitis (see page 655) that would affect your breathing. The surgeon may remove all or part of your lung. Radiation therapy (see page 23) and chemotherapy (see page 23) may slow the growth of the tumor and may help relieve symptoms, but these treatments rarely cure lung cancer. Remission (a partial or complete disappearance of symptoms) that follows treatment may last months or years.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Infections of the Respiratory Tract]\nMost infections of the respiratory tract are caused by viruses or bacteria. Upper respiratory tract infections affect the nose, throat, sinuses, and larynx (voice box). Lower respiratory tract infections affect the trachea (windpipe) and lungs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Infections of the Respiratory Tract > Colds]\nApproximately 200 different viruses can cause the common cold. In most cases, the virus that causes a cold is confined to the nose and throat. Sometimes a cold virus travels to other parts of the respiratory tract, such as the larynx (voice box) or lungs, causing other infections, such as laryngitis or acute bronchitis. A cold virus can also lead to a bacterial infection, which can have more severe symptoms. The bacteria can travel to the ears, sinuses, or airways in the lungs and cause infection.\n\nUsually, you catch a cold by touching an infected person or contaminated surface or by inhaling infected droplets coughed or sneezed into the air. A sneeze or a cough from a person with a cold can spread virus-containing droplets up to 10 feet away. Most people have their first cold by the time they are 1 year old. With each cold, you develop lifelong immunity to that particular cold virus. Because most people acquire more immunity as they grow older, they tend to get fewer colds and have less severe symptoms when they do get colds.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Infections of the Respiratory Tract > Symptoms]\nTo some extent, the symptoms of a cold depend on the cold virus that caused it.

The flu can spread from the nose or mouth to the rest of the respiratory system, including the lungs. It is usually spread by touching an infected person or contaminated surface or by inhaling infected droplets coughed or sneezed into the air. If a bacterial infection develops in addition to the viral infection and travels from the upper respiratory tract to the lungs, it can cause more serious disorders, such as acute bronchitis (see page 655) or pneumonia (see page 660). Influenza kills about 20,000 people a year in the United States.\n\nThere are three main types of influenza virus—A, B, and C. If you have had the flu caused by a type C virus (a relatively mild type of flu with symptoms similar to those of a cold), you are immune to it for life. If you have been infected with a particular strain of a type A or B influenza virus, you have immunity to that strain only. Although both A and B influenza viruses can produce new strains that can overcome a person's immunity, the type B virus seldom alters itself sufficiently to do so. But the type A virus constantly changes, and the changes are significant enough to make it look like a new virus to the immune system. For this reason, most flu epidemics and severe outbreaks are caused by type A viruses. These strains are usually named after their place of origin (such as the Hong Kong flu).\n\nInfluenza usually occurs in small outbreaks, often in the winter. Every few years, in unpredictable intervals, it occurs in epidemics. Two or three epidemics caused by different strains of the virus can occur at the same time. Epidemics die out when everyone who has been infected by a particular strain of a flu virus becomes immune to that strain.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nSymptoms of the flu vary widely. You may have a fever with shaking and chills, sneezing, headache, muscle aches, and a sore throat. You may then develop a dry, hacking cough and chest pain. You will probably feel very weak. Some children have abdominal pain and seizures. If you have no complications, you should recover in 1 to 2 weeks, although you may still feel weak for a few weeks. If you seem to be the only person who has the flu, you may have some other viral illness such as mononucleosis (see page 935).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Flu Shots]\nBecause a flu infection can be debilitating or life-threatening, most doctors recommend that even healthy young adults and children get a flu shot every year. The vaccine now also comes in a nasal spray. The flu vaccine protects you for only a year (sometimes less), even against the strain it is meant to resist. Flu shots are usually administered in late fall after scientists have determined which strains are likely to cause the most widespread infections that year. In rare cases, flu shots can cause minor flulike symptoms such as a low fever and aches for a day or two. Because the vaccine is made from eggs, people who are allergic to eggs should not get a flu shot.\n\nDoctors especially recommend flu shots every year for the following people:\n\n- Those over age 65\n- People who have a chronic disease (such as diabetes or cancer) or any disease that impairs the immune system (such as AIDS)\n- Those who have a chronic lung disorder\n- Health care workers\n- Healthy children between 6 months and 2 years of age.\n\nSee your doctor if your symptoms are severe, last longer than 10 days, or seem to have spread to your lungs (causing wheezing, shortness of breath, or a painful cough), or if you have a chronic disease (especially a lung disorder or an immune system disorder). You should also see your doctor if your fever lasts longer than 3 or 4 days.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Q & A > Influenza]\n**Q.** *My company is offering free flu shots. My sister said that she got sick after getting a flu shot last year. Can getting a flu shot make you get the flu?*\n\n**A.** No. The virus used to make the flu vaccine is inactivated and therefore cannot cause an actual flu infection. However, you can get the flu if you are exposed to the virus within a week or two after getting vaccinated (before the vaccine's protection takes effect) or if a prevalent strain of the virus that year was not included in the vaccine. After getting the shot, you may feel sore at the site of the injection, but you will not get the flu from the shot.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosis]\nDoctors can usually diagnose the flu by the symptoms, especially when they occur during flu season in fall or winter. If you have symptoms that persist, your doctor will examine you to see if they could be caused by another disease.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Treatment]\nThere is no cure for influenza, but you can take measures to relieve the symptoms. Rest, stay comfortably warm (but not hot), and drink plenty of water to help prevent dehydration.

In severe cases of sinusitis, he or she may order X-rays or a CT scan (see page 112) to confirm the diagnosis. X-rays may also rule out a tooth abscess. A CT scan can help the doctor determine the extent of the inflammation and the severity of the sinusitis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf you have sinusitis, your doctor may recommend inhaling steam to relieve nasal congestion by promoting the drainage of mucus. Add moisture to the air in your home with a vaporizer or humidifier. Blow your nose gently to avoid damaging your sinuses. You will be more comfortable if you keep your head elevated, especially while you sleep. Use decongestant tablets only if your doctor recommends them; although decongestants shrink the swollen mucous membrane (widening the respiratory airways), when used incorrectly they can cause heart problems such as arrhythmias (see page 580).\n\nIf your symptoms persist, your doctor may recommend a corticosteroid nasal spray. He or she will prescribe antibiotics only if your sinusitis is caused by a bacterial infection. In rare, severe cases, surgery may be necessary to enlarge the opening of the affected sinus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Strep Throat**]\nA sore throat is usually a symptom of a viral infection but sometimes can result from a bacterial infection. Strep throat is caused by a streptococcus bacterium that can be contracted when you inhale infected droplets coughed or sneezed into the air or by\n\ntouching an infected person or contaminated surface. Strep throat is more common in children than in adults.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nSymptoms of strep throat vary from person to person. Usually the throat is very red and the tonsils are swollen and have white patches of pus. The throat may be so sore that it is difficult to swallow, although some people have no throat pain. Other symptoms include fever (often higher than 101°F), headache, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, and general body aches. Children may lose their appetite and have abdominal pain and nausea. If you have strep throat, you usually do not have a runny or stuffy nose or a cough.\n\nIn rare cases, strep throat infections can lead to infections in the ears, bloodstream, kidneys, or lungs, or to scarlet fever (see page 443) or rheumatic fever (see page 432). Call your doctor immediately if you develop any of the following symptoms: rash; extreme fatigue; bloody nasal discharge; painful, swollen joints; cough; shortness of breath; chest pain; recurring fever; earache; or seizures.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nThe only way for your doctor to definitively diagnose strep throat is to take a sample of secretions from your throat, grow the sample (culture) in a laboratory for 2 to 3 days, and examine it under a microscope for the presence of strep bacteria or other microorganisms. Your doctor may give you a so-called rapid strep test, which can usually produce results in about 10 to 30 minutes. However, the results are not as accurate as those from a throat culture, and the test can only detect one type of strep bacteria and no other microorganisms. If the results of the rapid strep test show a strep infection, no further testing is necessary. If the results are negative, your doctor will send a sample to a laboratory for a culture to verify the results.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nStrep throat is usually treated with an oral antibiotic. Although your symptoms may subside in a few days, you need to complete the full course of the antibiotic to be sure all the bacteria have been killed and to avoid creating a stronger strain of bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics.\n\nTo relieve the symptoms of strep throat, gargle with warm salted water every few hours to help soothe the throat pain and help eliminate pus from the infected area. Drink plenty of water. Take an over-the-counter pain reliever to ease pain and reduce your fever.\n\nFor people who have severe, frequent strep throat infections (more than twice a year for an adult and more than four times a year for a child), your doctor may recommend removing the tonsils (tonsillectomy; see below right).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Tonsillitis]\nTonsillitis is acute inflammation of the tonsils, usually resulting from a bacterial or viral infection, including strep throat (see previous article). The tonsils are two masses of tissue at the back of the throat that are part of the lymphatic system, which plays an important role in the immune system. Normally, the tonsils are very small at birth, gradually increase in size until age 6 or 7, and then shrink (although they usually do not disappear entirely). In young children, the tonsils help control infections in the nose and throat and protect against upper respiratory tract infections.

Occasional, uncomplicated bouts of laryngitis are not serious, but recurring episodes can lead to persistent hoarseness or abnormal growths on the vocal cords (see page 637).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Laryngitis > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptom of laryngitis is a distorted or cracking voice or a complete loss of voice. The inflammation causes the vocal cords to swell, distorting their normal sound, usually for no more than 2 or 3 days. Speaking may be painful, and sometimes a person with laryngitis has a fever. In children, the opening of the larynx is narrow, and inflammation can cause difficulty breathing. See your doctor if symptoms persist for more than 4 or 5 days or if you cough up phlegm.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Laryngitis > *Diagnosis*]\nIf, after examining your larynx, your doctor finds no sign of inflammation, he or she will recommend that you have more tests; you could have a polyp, nodule, or tumor on your larynx.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Laryngitis > *Treatment*]\nIf you have laryngitis, rest your voice as much as you can and drink plenty of water. Don't drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes, because alcohol and smoke can irritate the larynx. Do not whisper; whispering strains the larynx and vocal cords. Use a humidifier or vaporizer to add moisture to the air.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Respiratory Syncytial Virus]\nThe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most common causes of respiratory infections in both children and adults and is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia (see page 660) and bronchiolitis (see page 421) in infants and young children.\n\nMost children contract an RSV infection by the time they are 2 years old and have no problems. However, children who were born prematurely, are younger than 6 months old, or have chronic lung, heart, or immune system disorders are at increased risk of complications from an RSV infection. They also are more likely to later develop long-term respiratory problems such as asthma (see page 640) or other chronic lung diseases after an RSV infection.\n\nOutbreaks of RSV occur throughout the year but are most common in the fall and winter. The virus is highly contagious and can be contracted when a person inhales infected droplets coughed or sneezed into the air or by touching an infected person or contaminated surface (the virus can live from 4 to 7 hours on inanimate surfaces).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of an RSV infection resemble those of a cold, such as a runny and stuffy nose, sore throat, and a slight fever. In children who are at high risk, symptoms may be severe and include a high fever, coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing or rapid breathing. Severe cases can cause respiratory failure. The infection usually lasts about 5 days. A person can become infected with RSV more than once, but subsequent infections tend to be milder.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIt is especially important to identify an RSV infection early in children who are at increased risk. To diagnose an RSV infection, a doctor will listen to the lungs with a stethoscope to detect any unusual sounds. He or she may then recommend a chest X-ray and test samples of blood and phlegm to determine if the infection is caused by RSV.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nNo vaccine exists for RSV. Treatment of mild RSV infections in older children and adults is similar to the treatment for colds—drinking water to prevent dehydration,\n\ninhaling steam to break up congestion, taking an over-the-counter pain reliever to reduce fever and ease pain, and using a saline nasal spray to relieve a stuffy nose.\n\nTo treat a severe RSV infection, a doctor may prescribe an antiviral drug called ribavirin, which is administered through an aerosol spray. In children who are at increased risk, a severe RSV infection may require hospitalization.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prevention*]\nTo help prevent the spread of RSV, wash your hands frequently and avoid contact with people who seem to have a cold. When possible, keep at-risk children away from people who are sick. To prevent RSV infections in at-risk children, doctors may recommend giving them antibodies (immune proteins) to fight RSV. This medication, called palivizumab, is given in a shot once a month during RSV season (usually from November to April).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Acute Bronchitis**]\nAcute bronchitis is inflammation of the airways of the lungs (the bronchi and bronchioles) that is usually caused by a viral infection such as a cold or the flu, although it may also b", "response": {"entity_entity": [], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

He or she also will recommend diagnostic tests such as a chest X-ray and lung function tests (see page 647).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > Q & A > Chronic Bronchitis]\n**Q.** *I have chronic bronchitis and my coughing keeps me up at night. Why did my doctor ask me not to take cough suppressants?*\n\n**A.** Although cough-suppressing medications may relieve your cough, most contain derivatives of opium (such as codeine) that keep you from coughing up phlegm. The phlegm can dry and plug up your lungs and airways, making your bronchitis worse.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe treatment for chronic bronchitis depends on how far it has progressed before it is diagnosed. If you are having difficulty breathing, your doctor probably will prescribe a bronchodilator (see page 641) administered through an aerosol inhaler to open the airways and make your breathing easier. You will probably use the bronchodilator three\n\nor four times a day, every 4 to 6 hours. Your doctor may prescribe a small dose of an antibiotic to take for several weeks or months to help prevent bacterial infections. Alternatively, he or she may prescribe a full course of antibiotics only for flare-ups or obvious infections.\n\nIf you smoke, the best thing you can do for your chronic bronchitis is to quit smoking (see page 29) and avoid smoky environments. If you work or live in a polluted environment, consider changing jobs or moving. If you move, try to choose not only a cleaner environment but also a warmer, drier one. Warm, dry air is easier to breathe than cold, humid air. Avoid contact with people who have a cold or the flu because illnesses that affect the respiratory system can bring on an episode of bronchitis. Get a vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia (see page 145) every 5 to 7 years and a flu shot (see page 650) every year.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Emphysema]\nEmphysema is a disease that causes a permanent change in the structure of the alveoli (the tiny air sacs in the lungs where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place). Cigarette smoking is almost always the cause of emphysema. The smoke from cigarettes causes inflammation in lung tissues and inactivates a beneficial enzyme called alpha<sub>1</sub> antitrypsin, which normally protects the alveoli. In response to chronic inflammation in the alveoli caused by cigarette smoke, infection-fighting white blood cells go to the site of the inflammation and release a different enzyme to eliminate it. However, because alpha<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin no longer protects the alveoli, the enzyme released by the white blood cells damages the walls of the alveoli, causing emphysema.\n\nOther factors that can cause the airways of the lungs to narrow and contribute to the development of emphysema include pollution, recurring respiratory tract infections, and allergies that affect the respiratory tract. In rare cases, emphysema also may develop in people who have an inherited disorder called alpha<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin deficiency and lack the protective enzyme.\n\nHealthy lungs are elastic, and contract and expand fully. When the alveoli of the lungs are stretched out, as occurs in emphysema, the alveoli rupture and merge to make fewer and larger air spaces. The increased pressure caused by labored breathing and spasms of coughing weakens the walls of the alveoli even more. Emphysema can make you more susceptible to chest infections such as pneumonia (see page 660) and can lead to respiratory failure (see page 645) or congestive heart failure (see page 570).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptom of emphysema is shortness of breath. At first, the shortness of breath occurs only during exercise or strenuous activity. But over time, the shortness of breath worsens and occurs during everyday activities. The person's chest may become barrel-shaped because, as the lungs lose their elasticity, air becomes trapped in the lungs. If you also have chronic bronchitis (see page 655), as most people with emphysema do, you may cough up phlegm.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo confirm a diagnosis of emphysema, your doctor probably will tap your chest with his or her fingers and listen to and interpret the sounds produced by the tapping. He or she will also listen to your lungs with a stethoscope and will probably recommend diagnostic tests such as a chest X-ray and lung function tests (see page 647).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nEmphysema cannot be cured, but the symptoms can be treated and the progression of the disease can be slowed if you stop smoking. Treatment can improve the quality and length of your life. Quitting smoking (see page 29) is the single most important step you can take.

The heart and lungs are removed by severing the trachea, aorta, and the point at which the heart connects to the vena cava (the two major veins that drain oxygenated blood from the body into the right side of the heart). Blood vessels linking the donor heart and lungs are left intact.\n\nTo transplant the donor's organs (shaded areas) into the recipient, a surgeon makes an incision in the breastbone of the recipient and opens the chest. The recipient is connected to a heart-lung machine, which removes carbon dioxide and replaces it with oxygen, and allows blood flow to bypass the heart and lungs. The recipient's diseased heart and lungs are removed separately. The new lungs are attached first, then the heart, followed by the blood vessels.

If you smoke, stop (see page 29). Avoid breathing in smoky or polluted air. Try to avoid getting colds and other respiratory infections. Your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic at the first sign of an infection. In severe, frequently recurring cases of bronchiectasis, a doctor may recommend surgery to remove the affected part of the lung.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pneumonia]\nPneumonia is a general term for inflammation of the lungs. It is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection but can also result from damage to the lungs from toxic substances (such as poisonous gases) or from injury. Less frequently, pneumonia is caused by fungi, yeasts, or other microscopic organisms. Pneumonia is a common complication of a variety of disorders, including upper respiratory tract infections such as the flu (see page 649) or acute bronchitis (see page 655). Pneumonia can also be a complication of a chronic disease such as congestive heart failure, cancer, stroke, or emphysema. In people who have these diseases, pneumonia is often given as the cause of death.\n\nPneumonia is very common in people who smoke or who have chronic lung infections and in people who cannot cough up phlegm forcefully enough to clear their lungs (such as people who are very sick or weak). It is especially common in people who are taking drugs that suppress the immune system (such as after an organ transplant to prevent rejection) or whose immune system is impaired because of an illness such as AIDS (see page 909).\n\nPneumonia has many different medical names, usually depending on the location of the inflammation in the lung (such as interstitial pneumonia or lobar pneumonia), on the virus or bacterium that caused the pneumonia (such as pneumococcal pneumonia), or on how the pneumonia was contracted (aspiration pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia). Atypical pneumonia is pneumonia caused by microorganisms other than bacteria (bacterial pneumonias are more common). Walking pneumonia usually refers to milder forms of pneumonia that do not require hospitalization.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pneumonia > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of pneumonia depend on the cause of the infection and on a person's general health. No single symptom is characteristic of all types of pneumonia. In general, you should consider the possibility that you have pneumonia if you have a respiratory illness with coughing, fever with chills, sweating, chest pains, muscle aches, fatigue, headache, nausea and vomiting, a bluish tinge to the lips or skin (from lack of oxygen), or green or blood-stained phlegm. You may also have mental confusion or shortness of breath. The severity of symptoms depends on how much of the lung is affected.\n\nHow quickly symptoms begin varies with the infection. Some symptoms can start within hours of exposure to the disease-causing organism, some in a few days, and some\n\nup to 10 days after exposure. An especially strong strain of bacteria can be quickly fatal for a person who has an impaired immune system. In a healthy young adult, pneumonia from a mild respiratory tract infection may cause symptoms that are no worse than those of a severe cold. See your doctor immediately if you suddenly become feverish with shortness of breath, if your chest hurts when you breathe, if you have a temperature over 101°F with chills, or if you cough up blood-stained phlegm.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have symptoms of pneumonia, your doctor will examine you, listen to your lungs with a stethoscope, and tap your chest with his or her fingers to listen to (and interpret) the sounds produced by the tapping. Your doctor may recommend that you have a chest X-ray and may take blood and phlegm samples to examine them for the presence of microorganisms that could cause pneumonia.

The infection is caused by a virus of the coronavirus family, to which the common cold virus belongs. The SARS virus seems to spread through close person-to-person contact, usually in infected droplets from coughs or sneezes. Those most at risk include household members and health care workers who come in close contact with an infected person. The virus may be able to live on inanimate surfaces for 24 hours, unlike the common cold virus, which can live only up to 3 hours on inanimate surfaces. Most people recover from SARS but, in some people, the infection is fatal.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nSymptoms of SARS usually develop within 10 days of exposure to the virus and include a fever higher than 100.4°F accompanied by coughing or difficulty breathing. Some people have only mild symptoms, while others have severe, life-threatening respiratory symptoms. There is no specific diagnostic test for SARS.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThere is no effective treatment or cure for SARS. If SARS is suspected, the person is hospitalized and put in isolation to prevent the virus from spreading. Treatment is given based on the person's symptoms and may include an antiviral medication such as ribavirin (usually given intravenously) along with corticosteroids (to reduce inflammation in the lungs) and antibiotics (if the person also has a bacterial infection). The person may also be given fluids intravenously. If a person has severe breathing problems, he or she may need a ventilator to assist with breathing. Up to 90 percent of people start to recover within 6 to 7 days of developing symptoms.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Fungal Diseases of the Lungs]\nSeveral diseases that infect the lungs can result from breathing in fungal spores. These fungal infections are contracted primarily by inhaling the spores (usually found in soil) from bird or bat droppings or from decaying plant matter such as old wood or dead leaves. The diseases are named for the fungus that causes them. For example, aspergillosis is caused by a species of the fungus *Aspergillus*, blastomycosis by *Blastomyces dermatitidis*, coccidioidomycosis by *Coccidioides immitis*, cryptococcosis by *Cryptococcus neoformans*, and histoplasmosis by *Histoplasma capsulatum*. In healthy people, the immune system destroys the spores. However, in some people (usually people who have an impaired immune system or who are very old or very young), the fungal infection can spread throughout the body in the bloodstream and become life-threatening.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nMany fungal diseases of the lungs begin with mild, chronic, flulike symptoms such as fever with chills, coughing, chest pain, and muscle aches, but may progress to symptoms of pneumonia (see page 660) such as wheezing or difficulty breathing. Some fungal diseases of the lungs can cause other respiratory disorders, such as allergies (see page 912) or asthma (see page 640). Some may cause skin reactions such as a rash (coccidioidomycosis), skin lesions (blastomycosis), or mouth ulcers (histoplasmosis) in addition to respiratory symptoms. Cryptococcosis may not cause symptoms or may cause weight loss, night sweats, and meningitis (see page 692) in addition to flulike symptoms. See your doctor immediately if you have any symptoms of a fungal infection in your lungs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose a fungal infection in your lungs, your doctor will examine you and listen to your lungs with a stethoscope. In addition, he or she may order blood tests and test samples of your phlegm, urine, or spinal fluid to determine if you have a fungal infection. For a definite diagnosis, you may have a bronchoscopy (see previous page).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nFungal diseases sometimes clear up on their own without treatment. If your symptoms are mild, your doctor may prescribe an oral antifungal medication. However, if your symptoms are severe or if you are susceptible to infection because your immune system is weakened, your doctor will probably administer an antifungal medication intravenously (through a vein).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Legionnaires' Disease**]\nLegionnaires' disease is a potentially serious form of pneumonia (see page 660) caused by a bacterium that breeds in warm, moist environments, usually water and air-conditioning systems. Infection can occur when a person inhales droplets of contaminated water. Older people, smokers, people who have lung disorders, and people with an impaired immune system are most susceptible to infection, and some can die of the infection. Young, healthy people generally recover fully.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of Legionnaires' disease develop about a week after exposure to the bacterium and include fever with chills, headache", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "SARS", "relation": "caused by", "tail": "coronavirus family"}, {"head": "common cold virus", "relation": "belongs to", "tail": "coronavirus family"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

The brain and spinal cord comprise the central nervous system, which coordinates all the body's interactions with the environment. The human brain is a highly complex organ that regulates most of the body's functions and changes in response to stimulation from the environment. The brain uses the outside world to build itself after birth and goes through critical periods in childhood during which brain cells need to have specific kinds of stimulation to develop such powers as language, smell, vision, muscle control, and reasoning. Not only does the brain have the ability to change in response to stimulation, such as learning new information, it also continues to make new brain cells throughout life.\n\nThe peripheral nervous system is a vast network of nerves that runs from the spinal cord to the rest of the body. The peripheral nerves connect at different levels with the spinal cord, through which information flows back and forth between the nerves and the brain. This system controls your conscious movements and automatically maintains your posture and muscle tone with a system of reflexes. Peripheral nerves called the cranial nerves connect directly to the brain through openings in the skull. The cranial nerves serve functions such as vision, eye movement, hearing, and facial movement and feeling.\n\nAll the biochemical processes inside your body and the actions of your internal organs are involuntary—that is, you are not aware of them and you have no control over them. A system of nerves called the autonomic system regulates vital functions such as heartbeat, blood pressure, and body temperature.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of Blood Vessels in the Brain]\nFour major arteries deliver blood to the brain: two carotid arteries in the front of the neck and two vertebral arteries in the back of the neck. At the base of the brain, the four arteries join together to form a circle of\n\nconnections from which smaller arteries branch out to supply blood to all parts of the brain.\n\nVascular disorders such as a stroke occur when an artery ruptures or becomes blocked, cutting off the blood supply to part of the brain. Areas of the brain that receive blood from a single artery are especially vulnerable to damage from an obstruction of blood flow.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Nervous System and the Brain > The Nervous System]\nThe central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord, is an intricate communications network that controls the inner workings of our body and allows us to respond to our environment. The peripheral nervous system is made up of the peripheral nerves, which run from the spinal cord to all other parts of the body. The central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system work together as a unit: the peripheral nerves gather information from the environment through the senses (such as touch and smell), transmit the sensory information to the central nervous system, and carry signals from the central nervous system to the skin, muscles, bones, joints, and internal organs (including the heart).\n\nDiagram illustrating the human nervous system, showing the brain, spinal cord, and various peripheral nerves.\n\n- **Brain (control center)**\n- **Spinal cord (links brain to body)**\n- **Brachial plexus (intersection of nerves that serve the arms and hands)**\n- **Cranial nerves (serve functions such as vision, eye movement, and hearing)**\n- **Cervical nerves (serve neck, back of head, diaphragm, and arms)**\n- **Thoracic nerves (serve chest, back, and part of abdomen)**\n- **Lumbar nerves (serve lower back, part of abdomen, and parts of legs)**\n- **Sacral nerves (serve legs, anus, bladder, and genital area)**\n- **Sciatic nerves (serve hips, legs, and feet)**\n\n![](_page_1217_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Brain]\nThe brain lies well protected within the rigid, bony case of the skull.

The cerebellum, located under the cerebrum at the top of the spinal cord, controls functions such as balance and coordination. The brain stem, which merges into the top of the spinal cord, contains nerve centers for the cranial nerves and fibers that connect the brain to the rest of the body.

The effects of a stroke may be temporary or permanent, mild or severe. Most strokes, called ischemic strokes, result from a blocked artery. Hemorrhagic strokes result from a ruptured or leaking artery.\n\nCerebral thrombosis, cerebral embolism, and cerebral hemorrhage are three possible causes of stroke. Cerebral thrombosis occurs when an artery that supplies blood to the brain becomes narrowed, usually as a result of atherosclerosis (see page 557). In atherosclerosis, fatty deposits called plaque build up in artery walls, narrowing the artery. Over time, the surface of a plaque may become roughened or cracked, providing an ideal site for blood cells to clump together and form a clot (thrombus) inside the blood vessel. The clot may continue to grow until it partially or completely blocks blood flow through the artery.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Stroke > Stroke]\nWhen an artery in the brain is blocked, the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. The lack of blood can damage the area of the brain normally supplied by the artery. An interruption in blood flow to one side of the brain can cause symptoms such as numbness, weakness, or paralysis on the opposite side of the body.\n\n![Diagram showing a cross-section of the human head and brain. Labels indicate: Damaged area of brain, Blockage, Carotid artery, and Vertebral artery.]()![](_page_1221_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nCerebral embolism occurs when an artery that supplies blood to the brain is blocked by an embolus. An embolus is usually a bit of debris (such as a fragment of plaque) or a blood clot that has traveled through the bloodstream from another part of the body. The embolus becomes wedged in an artery and obstructs blood flow to part of the brain.\n\nCerebral hemorrhage occurs when an artery ruptures or leaks, and blood seeps into surrounding brain tissue. An artery may leak or rupture as a result of an aneurysm (a weakened area of a blood vessel wall), damage to the artery caused by uncontrolled high blood pressure or diabetes, or an arteriovenous malformation (an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein, which can rupture). Although the initial effects of a hemorrhagic stroke may be more severe than those of an ischemic stroke, the long-term effects of both types of stroke depend on the part of the brain affected and the extent of the lasting damage.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Stroke > Berry aneurysm]\nA berry aneurysm results from a congenital (present at birth) defect in an artery wall. It forms at the base of the brain, where an artery branches. When a berry aneurysm ruptures, blood can spurt into surrounding brain tissue and cause brain damage.\n\n![Diagram showing a cross-section of a branching artery.

The effects of a stroke can differ widely from person to person. About one out of three younger people who have a stroke has long-term impairment, while three out of four older people have permanent disability.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Risk Factors*]\nThe following factors can increase your risk of stroke. However, most of these factors can be controlled or eliminated through lifestyle changes.\n\n- **Heart disease** Heart failure (see page 570) and irregular heart rhythms (see page 580) promote blood clot formation.\n- **High blood pressure** Uncontrolled high blood pressure damages blood vessels and promotes atherosclerosis.\n- **Undesirable cholesterol profile** An undesirable cholesterol profile (see page 146) promotes atherosclerosis.\n- **Lack of exercise** Being inactive can lead to weight gain and an undesirable cholesterol profile.\n- **Being overweight** Weighing more than your ideal body weight (see page 11) increases your risk of having an undesirable cholesterol profile, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes—all risk factors for stroke.\n- **Diabetes** Uncontrolled diabetes increases blood levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and promotes atherosclerosis.\n- **Smoking** Smoking (including secondhand smoke) increases blood pressure, damages the lining of blood vessels, and increases the risk of blood clot formation.\n- **Heavy drinking** Too much alcohol can raise blood pressure and increase the amount of triglycerides (a potentially harmful type of fat) in the blood.\n- **Previous strokes or transient ischemic attacks** People who have had transient ischemic attacks (TIAs; see page 675) or who have already had a stroke have a significantly increased risk of stroke.\n- **Family history of heart disease or stroke**", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "atherosclerosis", "relation": "result of", "tail": "cerebral thrombosis"}, {"head": "blocked artery", "relation": "cause of", "tail": "ischemic stroke"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: atherosclerosis]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: cerebral thrombosis]"}, {"head": "[Event: ruptured or leaking artery]", "relation": "cause of", "tail": "[Event: hemorrhagic stroke]"}]}, "status": "success"}

A few years ago I started a new job and was sent to a doctor for a complete physical. She asked a lot of questions about my health and my habits and then examined me. My blood pressure was high and she said she wanted to check it again in a few days. About a week later, my blood pressure was even higher, and a blood test showed that I had too much bad cholesterol in my blood.\n\n*I couldn't help thinking that I might have prevented this stroke if I had followed a healthier lifestyle.*\n\nThe doctor wrote a couple of prescriptions and told me I needed to quit smoking. She also told me that losing weight and exercising would help lower my blood pressure. She gave me a couple of pamphlets about exercise, healthy eating, and losing weight. I took my medication every day, started eating healthier foods, like fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains, and tried to cut back on salt, fat, and cholesterol. I started taking walks after dinner. After a couple of weeks, I started to feel pretty good and the weight started coming off—3 pounds that first week. After a couple of months, I had lost about 10 pounds and I was feeling really good. In fact, I felt so good that\n\nI stopped taking the medication. Eventually I stopped taking walks and fell back into my old eating habits. And I was still smoking.\n\nOne day when I woke up, the right side of my face was numb and I couldn't see too well out of my right eye. I had a really bad headache and was dizzy. I tried to tell my wife, but the words came out slurred. She ran to the phone and called 911 for an ambulance.\n\nIn the emergency room, some doctors and nurses gathered around and asked me a few questions, but I couldn't talk. My wife told them what had happened. A couple of the doctors examined me and hooked me up to a machine that showed my heartbeat on a monitor, which looked like little blips on a screen. Then a nurse gave me an injection and told me it was medication that would dissolve the blood clot that was causing my problem. One of the doctors told me that he was putting me in the intensive care unit for a few days so they could monitor my symptoms. A day or so later I started to get the feeling back in my face and could see OK, but I still couldn't talk right. A speech therapist said that the stroke might have permanently damaged the part of my brain that controls speech. She said if my speech didn't get better in a couple of days, she would start to work with me. I couldn't help thinking that I might have prevented this stroke if I had followed a healthier lifestyle.\n\nI now feel lucky. It's been a couple of months since my stroke and I have totally recovered. I am talking normally again and I'm taking much better care of my health. My wife is very supportive and we both eat lots of fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods and take long walks together every day. My wife and I have both lost weight and we feel better than ever.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nThe diagnosis of a stroke is based on the symptoms, a physical examination, and the results of tests. Your doctor will probably order a CT scan (see page 112) or MRI (see page 113) of your brain to determine the type of stroke and location and the extent of the damage. The doctor will also order blood tests to evaluate blood clotting. In addition to these tests, he or she may order a cerebral angiogram, an X-ray examination of the arteries in the brain. A cerebral angiogram enables the doctor to detect blocked or narrowed arteries and to evaluate blood flow in the arteries. Your doctor may also\n\norder an echocardiogram (an ultrasound examination of the heart; see page 561) to check for blood clots and to determine if your heart is pumping effectively.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > Effects of a stroke]\nEach side of the brain controls the opposite side of the body. For this reason, damage to the left side of the brain may result in paralysis and loss of sensation in the right side of the body.\n\n![Diagram of a human body showing the left side of the brain and the corresponding right side of the body, illustrating the control of opposite sides.]()![](_page_1226_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\nIf the stroke was caused by a blood clot and treatment is early enough, the doctor will administer thrombolytic drugs to dissolve the clot and restore blood flow to the affected part of the brain. These drugs are safest and most effective when given within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms. The doctor will also order a Doppler ultrasound scan (see page 111) of the neck or an MRA (magnetic resonance angiogram) to evaluate blood flow in arteries in the brain. The doctor will order an electrocardiogram (ECG; see page 559), a recording of the electrical activity of the heart. Some people may need to wear a\n\nportable ECG device called a Holter monitor for 24 hours or more to check for abnormal heart rhythms.

A rehabilitation team may include the following:\n\n- **Doctors** Doctors—such as a neurologist (a doctor who specializes in treating disorders of the nervous system), a physiatrist (a doctor who specializes in physical medicine and rehabilitation), and an internist, family doctor, or geriatrician (a doctor who specializes in treating health problems in older people)—provide acute care, supervise the rehabilitation process, and coordinate long-term care.\n- **Nurses** Nurses who specialize in rehabilitation teach stroke survivors and their caregivers about eating, exercising, taking medication, preventing pressure sores, and other aspects of home health care.\n- **Physical therapists** Physical therapists evaluate a person's physical abilities and develop and carry out a treatment program designed to help him or her regain muscle strength, mobility, flexibility, and coordination. The program may include exercise, massage, and other therapies. Physical therapists can teach people how to use equipment such as walkers, canes, and wheelchairs.\n- **Occupational therapists** Occupational therapists help the person regain muscle control and coordination and adjust to and compensate for physical limitations. They help the person relearn the basic activities of daily living (such as eating, bathing, and dressing). Occupational therapists teach people how to use equipment such as canes, walkers, and wheelchairs. They also show people how to change their home environment to make it safer and more user-friendly.\n- **Speech therapists** Speech therapists help people regain the ability to speak, or teach them (and their families) other methods of effective communication. Speech therapists also help people learn to deal with swallowing problems.\n- **Social workers** Social workers can provide counseling, guidance, support, and direct assistance. They can evaluate the person's needs for assistance and make arrangements or referrals for needed services such as transportation, financial assistance, legal assistance, home health care, and housing.\n- **Mental health professionals** A psychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health professional can help the person deal with depression (see page 709) or other psychological problems that frequently occur after a stroke (see box below).\n- **Vocational therapists** Vocational therapists can help people return to work by helping them develop résumés, assisting in job searches and retraining programs, and providing referrals to vocational rehabilitation agencies.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Stroke and Mental Health]\nAfter a stroke, many people experience depression. They may feel isolated or frustrated, especially if their recovery is progressing slowly or if they are having problems communicating. Symptoms of depression include sleeplessness, indifference, and withdrawal. For most people, the depression is temporary, and they may benefit from joining a support group or talking to a psychiatrist or other mental health professional. If the depression persists, a doctor may prescribe antidepressant medications (see page 712) such as tricyclics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or bupropion.\n\nSome people who have had a stroke may have difficulty controlling their emotions. For example, they may experience mood swings or they may laugh or cry more easily than usual. These emotional changes result from injury to the brain, so it is important for family and friends to understand that this is not deliberate behavior.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Preventing Strokes*]\nIf you have had a stroke, you are at risk of having another one. You can reduce your chances of having a stroke by doing the following:\n\n- **Exercise regularly.** Regular, moderate exercise—such as brisk walking or swimming—lowers your blood pressure, helps you maintain a healthy weight, reduces stress, improves your cholesterol profile, and reduces your risk of diabetes.\n- **Eat a healthy diet.** Eating a wide variety of nutritious foods—especially fruits, vegetables, and whole grains—that are low in salt, fat, and cholesterol improves your cholesterol profile, lowers your blood pressure, and helps you control your weight.\n- **Control your cholesterol.** You can improve your cholesterol profile by eating a nutritious, low-fat, high-fiber diet; exercising regularly; losing weight if you are overweight; and quitting smoking if you smoke.

The preventive measures that a doctor may recommend depend on a person's age and general health. You may be asked to take an aspirin once a day every day for the rest of\n\nyour life. Aspirin helps prevent TIAs and stroke by reducing the risk of blood clots. Doctors sometimes prescribe other anticoagulant drugs instead of or in addition to aspirin. More powerful anticoagulants can help reduce the risk of stroke in people with abnormal heart rhythms. In some cases, a doctor may recommend a surgical procedure called carotid endarterectomy (see page 674) to remove the fatty deposits that have narrowed the arteries.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > Transient ischemic attack]\nA transient ischemic attack is often caused by a clump of blood cells (a clot) flowing with the blood until it blocks a small artery in the brain. The effects of a transient ischemic attack are temporary; the clump quickly breaks up and is swept away in the bloodstream, restoring blood flow.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the stages of a transient ischemic attack (TIA). The first stage shows a blood clot in an artery. The second stage shows the clot blocking the artery. The third stage shows the clot breaking up, and the blood vessel reopens.]()![](_page_1235_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > Subarachnoid Hemorrhage]\nThe surface of the brain is covered by three membranes called meninges. The thick, outermost membrane, the dura mater, adheres to the skull, while the thin, innermost membrane, the pia mater, adheres to the brain. The middle membrane, the arachnoid, is closer to the dura mater than to the pia mater because the space between the arachnoid and the pia mater (called the subarachnoid space) is filled with cerebrospinal fluid. A subarachnoid hemorrhage occurs when blood leaks into the subarachnoid space, usually as the result of a ruptured aneurysm (see page 599). The blood may remain in the cerebrospinal fluid or it may burst through the pia mater into brain tissue when the aneurysm ruptures.\n\nA major hemorrhage (one that causes loss of consciousness) can cause permanent brain damage or death. One third of people who survive a major hemorrhage have additional hemorrhages. The permanent damage that can result from a hemorrhage\n\nvaries according to which areas of the brain are affected. A person can have partial paralysis, weakness, numbness, or vision and speech problems that can linger or be permanent. Subarachnoid hemorrhage most often occurs in people between ages 40 and 60 and is slightly more common in women than in men. People who have high blood pressure (see page 574) or diabetes (see page 889) are at increased risk.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > Subarachnoid hemorrhage]\nIn a subarachnoid hemorrhage, a ruptured blood vessel causes blood to leak into the space between the arachnoid and the pia mater, the middle and inner membranes of the three membranes that cover the brain. If enough blood puts pressure on brain tissue, it can cause permanent brain damage and be life-threatening.\n\n![Diagram illustrating a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The image shows a sagittal view of the human head and brain. The skull is labeled. The dura mater, arachnoid, pia mater, and brain are labeled. A dark mass labeled 'Hemorrhage' is shown within the brain tissue, indicating a rupture in the blood vessels located between the arachnoid and the pia mater.]()![](_page_1236_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptom of a subarachnoid hemorrhage is a sudden, severe headache. A person also may have a stiff neck, be extremely sensitive to bright light (photophobia), or have stroke-like symptoms including faintness, dizziness, confusion, drowsiness, nausea, and vomiting. A major hemorrhage can cause sudden loss of consciousness.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > *Diagnosis*]\nFor a person who is unconscious, the doctor will take steps to restore and maintain circulation and breathing. He or she will order a CT scan (see page 112) to determine if there is bleeding in the brain or if some other condition is causing the loss of consciousness. If the scan is normal, the doctor may recommend a lumbar puncture (see page 693), a procedure in which a hollow needle is inserted into the lower part of the spine to withdraw a sample of cerebrospinal fluid for microscopic examination to look for blood or inflammation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf blood is found in the cerebrospinal fluid, the treatment of a subarachnoid hemorrhage will concentrate on preventing further bleeding. The doctor will order an angiogram (see page 110), an X-ray examination of the arteries that supply blood to the brain, to locate the source of the bleeding and to look for an aneurysm.

Without prompt treatment, bleeding in the brain can cause permanent brain damage or death.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > *Diagnosis*]\nA person who reports to a hospital emergency department with symptoms of a head injury will be evaluated immediately with diagnostic tests to determine the severity of the injury and its effects.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > *Treatment*]\nIf the injury has caused an epidural hemorrhage, the doctor will perform surgery immediately to stop the bleeding and relieve pressure on the brain. With prompt surgical treatment, most people recover completely from an epidural hemorrhage.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Structural Disorders of the Brain and Spinal Cord**]\nA structural disorder of the central nervous system occurs when part of the brain or spinal cord is distorted, malformed, or damaged. These problems can result from an injury, a tumor, or a disorder that affects the tissues,\n\nmembranes, or adjacent bones. Some people are born with malformed blood vessels in the brain that may not cause any symptoms until later in life.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Arteriovenous Malformations]\nArteriovenous malformations are congenital (present at birth) abnormalities of blood vessels that can occur in any part of the brain or spinal cord. The blood vessels are tangled, and there may be abnormal connections between arteries and veins, with fewer capillary connections than normal. Pressure can build up in these blood vessels and cause blood to leak into the brain. An arteriovenous malformation that causes a subarachnoid hemorrhage (see page 677) or bleeding into the brain or spinal cord can cause permanent damage or be fatal.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Arteriovenous Malformations > *Symptoms*]\nAlthough people are born with arteriovenous malformations, most do not cause symptoms for years. Symptoms such as recurring headaches and seizures develop when the malformation starts leaking blood into the brain or spinal cord or the subarachnoid space (the space between the middle and inner layers of membranes covering the brain and spinal cord). The damage that causes the seizures may be limited to only one part of the brain. These seizures may not always cause unconsciousness but can cause intermittent symptoms such as uncontrollable twitching in a part of the body controlled by the area of the brain in which the malformation is located.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Arteriovenous Malformations > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have symptoms of an arteriovenous malformation, your doctor may recommend that you have a CT scan (see page 112) or MRI (see page 113) and possibly an MRA (magnetic resonance angiogram) to look for abnormal blood vessels.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Arteriovenous Malformations > *Treatment*]\nDoctors usually use a combination of treatments for arteriovenous malformations. Leaking blood vessels in a malformation can sometimes be removed surgically or\n\nclosed to cut off their blood supply. For some malformations, doctors inject an acrylic material through the arteries in the brain into the malformation to destroy all of it or, in some cases, to eliminate the most fragile parts of the malformation that are at risk of leaking. For malformations that are not easy to reach surgically, radiation therapy (see page 23) may be recommended. In this procedure, doctors use angiography (see page 110) and a CT scan or MRI to find the exact location of the malformation. High-energy radiation is then directed into the center of the malformation to form scar tissue and close the abnormal blood vessels while minimizing injury to the surrounding brain tissue.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Brain Injury]\nA minor head injury usually results in little or no damage to the brain and it heals rapidly and completely. However, a more forceful blow to the head can damage the brain even if the skull is not fractured. In these closed head injuries, the brain can strike the inside surface of the skull, resulting in damage. After a severe head injury, the brain may swell and press against the skull, causing more brain damage. In a small percentage of cases, brain damage is severe enough to cause permanent mental and physical disability or death. A severe head injury may also cause a cerebral hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), which can lead to brain damage with symptoms resembling those of a stroke (see page 669). If the skull is fractured, bacteria or other microorganisms can enter the brain through the fracture and infect brain tissue, causing meningitis (see page 692). Severe brain injuries are most often caused by motor-vehicle collisions (especially those involving motorcycles), industrial work-related injuries, falls", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "bleeding", "relation": "can cause", "tail": "permanent brain damage"}, {"head": "bleeding", "relation": "can cause", "tail": "death"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "person", "relation": "will be evaluated", "tail": "[Event: with diagnostic tests]"}, {"head": "injury", "relation": "has caused", "tail": "[Event: epidural hemorrhage]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "reports to", "tail": "[Event: hospital emergency department]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: bleeding in the brain]", "relation": "can cause", "tail": "[Event: permanent brain damage or death]"}, {"head": "[Event: blow to the head within the past 24 hours]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: epidural hemorrhage]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Symptoms depend on the location of the damage and include numbness and muscle weakness or paralysis below the level of the injury (including the muscles that control the intestines and bladder). Sometimes the injury affects muscles on only one side of the body. If nearby bones and nerves are injured, you may have severe pain, although pain is not always a symptom of a spinal cord injury.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose a spinal cord injury, after immobilizing your spinal cord (to prevent further damage), your doctor will test different parts of your body and may ask you to try to move them. He or she will order X-rays, a CT scan (see page 112), or an MRI (see page 113) to verify the location of the injury and determine the extent of the damage. Your doctor may perform a procedure called myelography. In this procedure, he or she injects a contrast medium (dye) into the cerebrospinal fluid (the liquid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord); the contrast medium, which can be seen on an X-ray or CT scan, will highlight the damaged areas of the spinal cord.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTreatment of a spinal cord injury starts immediately. You will be immobilized because any movement could cause more damage to your spinal cord. Your doctor will immediately give you high doses of a corticosteroid medication to quickly reduce inflammation and swelling in the spinal cord. If the muscles that assist breathing have been weakened or paralyzed, you will be placed on a ventilator. A surgeon will remove\n\nany bone fragments and repair any damaged vertebrae that press on your spinal cord. If you have lost the ability to control your bladder, a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) will be inserted into your urethra to drain urine. After your doctor has determined the extent of your injury and your condition is stable, he or she may recommend occupational and physical therapy and counseling.\n\nMost spinal cord injuries result in permanent damage. Research is currently being done on ways to stimulate muscles to restore some degree of function. Drugs are being tested to try to improve the conduction of impulses through the damaged surviving nerve fibers.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Brain Tumor]\nA brain tumor is an abnormal growth in the brain that can be either benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Whether cancerous or not cancerous, a brain tumor is always dangerous because the skull makes it impossible for a growing tumor to expand anywhere but inward, into the brain. If untreated, a brain tumor can grow and cause permanent brain damage or death.\n\nCancerous brain tumors that originate in the brain (called primary brain cancer) are less common than cancerous tumors that have spread to the brain from another part of the body such as the breasts or lungs (called secondary, or metastatic, brain cancer). Primary brain tumors, which may be congenital (present at birth) or acquired later in life, seldom spread to other parts of the body. Secondary brain tumors, like most cancers, are more common later in life.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nAs a brain tumor enlarges, it may cause headaches that are worse in the morning or when you lie down. Over time, the headaches may become more severe and may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Other symptoms—such as blurred or double vision, dizziness, muscle weakness or loss of sensation (such as in the face or on one side of the body), hearing or memory loss, seizures, or a change in behavior—may develop, depending on the location of the brain tumor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have symptoms of a brain tumor, your doctor will refer you to a neurologist (a doctor who specializes in disorders of the nervous system). The neurologist will order a CT scan (see page 112) or MRI (see page 113) to determine if you have a brain tumor. If a tumor is found, the neurologist will order X-rays of other parts of your body, such as your chest, because of the possibility that the brain tumor originated elsewhere. He or she may recommend an angiogram (see page 110) to help identify the type of tumor, and to see if it is pressing on blood vessels. The neurologist may order an electroencephalogram (EEG; see page 687) to determine if the tumor is causing seizures.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nCorticosteroids to reduce swelling and surgery are usually the initial treatments for a primary brain tumor. A sample of tissue (biopsy) taken during the surgery can help determine the type of brain tumor and the best course of treatment.

For many people, migraines can be disabling. Because migraines tend to run in families, doctors think that there may be a genetic component.\n\nDuring a migraine, the arteries leading to the brain first become narrowed and then become dilated (widened) by nerve impulses inside the brain. Doctors believe that these changes in the diameter of the arteries produce the pain of a migraine. Narrowing of the arteries reduces blood flow to various parts of the brain, which may help explain some of the sensory disturbances—such as increased sensitivity to light, noise, or odors—that can accompany a migraine.\n\nIn many cases, specific substances, conditions, or circumstances trigger a migraine. Common triggers include consuming alcohol, chocolate, caffeine, monosodium glutamate (MSG) in processed foods, nitrates or nitrites in processed meats, and tyramine in cheese or red wine. Other possible triggers include exposure to fluorescent light, glaring light, high altitudes, strong odors, or sudden changes in environmental temperature or barometric pressure. For some women, migraines are associated with\n\nmenstrual periods. Other people may develop migraines during or immediately following times of emotional stress.\n\nMigraines seldom occur before puberty, but most people who have migraines usually have their first one before age 40. Migraines are more common in women than in men.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Headache Diary]\nKeeping a headache diary can help you determine what triggers your headaches so you can take steps to prevent them in the future. Bring your headache diary with you when you visit your doctor. The information it contains will help your doctor identify the cause of your headaches and plan appropriate treatment. Whenever you have a headache, write down the following information:\n\n- Date\n- Time the headache began\n- Time the headache ended\n- Intensity of pain (such as mild, moderate, or severe)\n- Type of pain (such as aching, throbbing, or stabbing)\n- Location of the pain\n- Other symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light)\n- Medication taken for headache (type and amount) and results\n- Self-treatment for headache (such as sleep, cold compresses, or relaxation techniques) and results\n- Activity you were engaged in when headache began (such as working or exercising)\n- Where you were when the headache began (such as indoors or outdoors)\n- Potential allergens nearby when the headache began (such as pollen, tobacco smoke, dust, or pets)\n- Other environmental factors (such as noises, odors, or room temperature)\n- Food or drink you consumed before the headache began\n- Your emotional state (such as angry, stressed, or tired) before the headache began\n- Medication you are taking for other reasons (both prescription and over the counter)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptom of a migraine is intense, throbbing pain that gets worse. The headache is usually accompanied by other symptoms—such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, aches, sweating, or extreme sensitivity to light or noise—that can vary from one person to another. Your eyes may be bloodshot and your skin may appear abnormally pale. Other symptoms may include numbness or tingling around your mouth or in one arm or down one side of your body, dizziness, ringing in your ears, or, rarely, temporary confusion.\n\nSome people experience a warning sign called an aura just before the onset of a migraine, during which they feel uncomfortable and fatigued and may experience some sort of visual disturbance, such as a zigzag distortion. An aura can last from several minutes to several hours, but once the headache begins, the warning symptoms usually fade.\n\nThe duration of a migraine and its timing can vary, but you may be able to learn from experience to predict the nature and duration of your headaches. Migraines usually last several hours—severe migraines can last a few days. Episodes may occur several times over the course of a week or once every few years. If you have recurring, severe headaches that you cannot control with over-the-counter pain relievers, see your doctor as soon as possible.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA migraine is diagnosed by the symptoms and by a neurological exami", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Headache", "relation": "may be a warning sign of", "tail": "serious underlying problem"}, {"head": "Fever", "relation": "accompanied by", "tail": "severe and persistent Headache"}, {"head": "Nausea or vomiting", "relation": "accompanied by", "tail": "severe and persistent Headache"}, {"head": "Stiff neck", "relation": "accompanied by", "tail": "severe and persistent Headache"}, {"head": "Pain in the eye or ear", "relation": "accompanied by", "tail": "severe and persistent Headache"}, {"head": "Dizziness, confusion, or loss of consciousness", "relation": "accompanied by", "tail": "severe and persistent Headache"}, {"head": "Weakness, numbness, or paralysis", "relation": "accompanied by", "tail": "severe and persistent Headache"}, {"head": "Seizures", "relation": "accompanied by", "tail": "severe and persistent Headache"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "You", "relation": "call", "tail": "[Event: 911 or your local emergency number]"}, {"head": "You", "relation": "go directly to the nearest hospital emergency department", "tail": "[Event: if your headache is severe and persistent, if it occurs after a blow to the head, or if it is accompanied by any of the following symptoms]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: if your headache is severe and persistent, if it occurs after a blow to the head, or if it is accompanied by any of the following symptoms]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: call 911 or your local emergency number or go directly to the nearest hospital emergency department]"}]}, "status": "success"}

In a healthy person, brain cells communicate with one another by sending electrical signals back and forth but, in a person who has epilepsy, the signals from one group of brain cells occasionally become so strong that they temporarily overwhelm nearby parts of the brain. This sudden, excessive electrical activity causes seizures (uncontrolled movements or temporary loss of consciousness or memory).\n\nGeneralized seizures—grand mal seizures or petit mal (or absence) seizures—affect the entire brain. Partial seizures affect a specific area of the brain. Partial seizures can be either simple partial seizures (during which the person remains aware) or complex partial seizures (during which the person loses touch with his or her surroundings and, sometimes, loses consciousness).\n\nIn most people with epilepsy, the cause is unknown. In some cases, the disorder can result from a problem such as a brain tumor, stroke, severe head injury, a brain infection, or a blood vessel malformation. Pesticide poisoning, withdrawal from alcohol or other drugs, drug overdose, or a chemical imbalance in the body can also trigger epilepsy. Between 1 and 2 percent of Americans have some form of epilepsy. The disease may run in families and affects men and women in equal numbers. Petit mal seizures occur mainly in children. Isolated, nonrecurring seizures (called febrile\n\nseizures) can occur in infants and toddlers as a result of a high fever from an infection. A child who has febrile seizures does not have epilepsy, but the seizures may increase his or her risk of developing the disorder later in life.\n\nIn people who have epilepsy, seizures can occur spontaneously or, occasionally, can be triggered by flickering or flashing lights, loud noises, or monotonous sounds. The risk of having a seizure increases with stress, lack of sleep, fatigue, or hunger, or when a person does not take his or her antiseizure medication properly.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nMany people who have epilepsy experience a warning of an oncoming seizure called an aura, which may occur just before or as much as several hours before a seizure. An aura may be a vague feeling of tension or unease, or it may be a recognizable sensory change such as a specific sound, disturbing odor, physical sensation, or visual disturbance.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > **Grand mal seizure**]\nDuring a grand mal seizure, a person experiences loss of balance and coordination, loss of consciousness, and uncontrollable twitching and jerking body movements. Some people may also lose bladder and bowel control. A seizure normally lasts 1 or 2 minutes, after which the person is usually disoriented and exhausted and does not remember the seizure.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > **Petit mal seizure**]\nDuring a petit mal seizure, a person (usually a child) suddenly stops whatever he or she is doing and becomes unaware and inattentive, staring blankly for a few seconds to half a minute. Some people may also experience brief confusion, slight muscle twitching, or rapid eye movements. The symptoms are subtle, and the person is not aware of the seizure. Children who have petit mal seizures are sometimes thought to be daydreaming. The seizures can occur hundreds of times throughout the day, interfering with a child's ability to concentrate or to complete simple tasks.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > **Simple partial seizure**]\nA simple partial seizure does not cause loss of consciousness. It usually begins with sudden, uncontrollable muscle twitching in one part of the body, which gradually spreads to other parts of the body. For example, the thumb of one hand may start twitching, then the entire arm twitches, and then the rest of that side of the body twitches. Other symptoms of a simple partial seizure can include tingling or\n\nhallucinations (of smell, taste, or vision). The person is aware of the seizure as it occurs and can recall the seizure afterward.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > Complex partial seizure]\nA person who has a complex partial seizure usually experiences an aura that lasts just a few seconds. He or she appears unaware and performs involuntary behaviors such as laughing for no apparent reason, speaking nonsensically, walking in circles, or smacking his or her lips. He or she may also lose consciousness. The person is not aware of the seizure as it occurs and does not recall it afterward. After a complex partial seizure, the person may sometimes feel detached from reality, be confused, or have memory problems.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > Diagnosis]\nTo diagnose epilepsy, a doctor performs a complete neurological examination that includes tests to evaluate the functioning of the nervous system, such as vision, reflexes, hearing, sensation, movement, and balance and coordination.

The exact cause of these disorders is not known, but some forms can be inherited. The diseases and their symptoms differ by the type of degenerative changes and by the areas of the brain that are affected. For example, Alzheimer's disease affects the areas of the brain responsible for intellect and memory, Parkinson's disease affects areas involved with movement, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) affects nerve cells that control muscles.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Alzheimer's Disease]\nAlzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, a brain disorder that results in a progressive and irreversible decline in mental functioning that eventually makes a person unable to perform daily activities. Alzheimer's disease causes severe memory loss, disorientation of space and time, and decline in the ability to think clearly and speak coherently.\n\nThe incidence of the disease escalates with age, affecting 1 in 10 people over 65 and 1 in 2 people over 85. An inherited form of Alzheimer's disease can develop in people in their 30s, 40s, and 50s. An estimated 4 million Americans may have Alzheimer's disease, which affects more women than men, perhaps because women tend to live longer than men. People can live with Alzheimer's disease for years, gradually losing more and more function. The average time from diagnosis to death is 4 to 8 years, but some people live with the disease for up to 20 years.\n\nThe most characteristic features of Alzheimer's disease are found in and around brain cells. Dense deposits of protein called neuritic plaques form around the brain cells at the same time that twisted strands of fiber called neurofibrillary tangles form inside the brain cells. These plaques and tangles are linked to the degeneration of brain cells and to their loss of connections with other brain cells. Some of the brain cells die. This process of brain cell degeneration and death begins in the regions of the brain responsible for memory and spreads to other areas that control language and thought. The process seems to be amplified by inflammation in the brain, which can be brought on by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\nScientists have discovered genes that are linked to late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Three variations of one of these genes are called apoE-2, apoE-3, and apoE-4. People can inherit these genes in six different combinations (one gene from each parent): two apoE-2s, two apoE-3s, two apoE-4s, apoE-2 and apoE-3, apoE-3 and apoE-4, and apoE-2 and apoE-4. ApoE-4 confers the greatest risk of Alzheimer's; apoE-2 provides the most protection against the disease. Nearly two thirds of us inherit two copies of apoE-3, giving us an average chance of developing Alzheimer's disease. A person who inherits two copies of the apoE-4 gene is eight times more likely to develop Alzheimer's, while a person who inherits two apoE-2 genes has the lowest risk of all. As researchers learn more about how these genes are linked to Alzheimer's disease, they will be able to develop more effective ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat the disorder.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nDoctors believe that the early stages of Alzheimer's disease probably begin decades before symptoms appear, as more and more plaques and tangles form in the brain. When symptoms become evident, they appear slowly. The first sign may be slight forgetfulness, especially of recent events. The person may have no trouble remembering what happened long ago, but may forget what happened 10 minutes ago and can't remember the date and current events. He or she may become disoriented, getting lost in familiar surroundings. Simple math problems become impossible to solve. Such mild symptoms are often mistaken for normal signs of aging.\n\nUsually, personality does not change as a person gets older but, in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, two key aspects of personality—conscientiousness and the ability to handle stress—may decline. People with the disease eventually display poor judgment and may become angry and belligerent, especially when someone tries to prevent them from doing something inappropriate or tries to help them.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms > Other Causes of Dementia]\nDementia is a term for a progressive loss of memory and other mental functions, such as language. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. Vascular dementia, the second most common form of dementia, occurs when small blood clots obstruct tiny blood vessels in the brain, causing multiple strokes that damage brain tissue. The symptoms of vascular dementia can be identical to those of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nLewy body dementia results from the presence of abnormal structures (Lewy bodies) in multiple areas of the brain.

These drugs can help improve the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in some people, but they do not stop the disease from progressing. They work by slowing the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain, one of the processes that lead to loss of memory and other mental functions. A newer drug called memantine is available for treating people with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. The drug slows down the decline of their thinking skills and ability to perform daily activities such as dressing and bathing. Memantine appears to work by regulating the activity of glutamate, a chemical messenger in the brain that plays an essential role in learning and memory. Some doctors also prescribe antianxiety medications to help relieve the sleeplessness and agitation common in people with the disorder.\n\nTreatment focuses primarily on managing the symptoms and supporting the person's ability to function independently for as long as possible. If you are a caregiver, your doctor will help you learn how to provide the best possible care for your loved one. For example, keeping routines and surroundings familiar can be comforting and stabilizing for people with Alzheimer's disease, who have difficulty learning and organizing new information. Explaining each step in a daily task such as dressing can help the person perform the task more easily. Do as much as you can to simplify the tasks by, for example, laying out the person's clothes in the order in which he or she should put them on. Show the person what to do by performing each task so he or she can copy your actions. Use calendars, clocks, and lists to help the person maintain some sense of time and purpose.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Care for the Caregiver]\nThe job of caring for a person with Alzheimer's disease can be overwhelming and exhausting. If you are a caregiver, the stress you are experiencing may make you feel depressed, frustrated, angry, guilty, or isolated. But for you to be able to help your loved one, you need to protect\n\nyour own health. The most significant step you can take to keep yourself healthy is to share your caregiving responsibilities. Don't be afraid to ask for help or to accept it when it is offered. Seek assistance from siblings and other family members, and take advantage of the time to yourself to get some needed rest and relaxation. Find resources such as home health aides, hired caregivers, or day care centers in your community. You may also be able to arrange for your loved one to be admitted to a nursing care facility for a brief period to allow you to take a break from your responsibilities. Use this time to go on a trip or find things that you enjoy doing.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Care for the Caregiver > *Preventing Alzheimer's Disease*]\nResearchers are studying some promising strategies for preventing Alzheimer's disease and improving the quality of life of people with the disease. For example, studies have found a link between Alzheimer's disease and mental stimulation, education levels, and other social and behavioral factors. People who continue to engage in intellectually challenging activities as they grow older seem to be less likely to develop symptoms of Alzheimer's disease than people who do not stay mentally active. Like a muscle, the brain needs stimulation to function at peak performance. Do crossword puzzles, take a class, read books, learn a foreign language—activities such as these may help you avoid or postpone symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nStudies are under way to determine if herbal therapies such as ginkgo biloba (see page 90) can slow the development of dementia or reduce the rate of cognitive loss from aging. Some doctors prescribe vitamin E supplements (400 IU daily) to their patients to possibly reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that can help neutralize the cell damage caused by molecules in the body called free radicals; this cell damage can cause inflammation in the brain, which has been linked to Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAnti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen also may provide some protection against Alzheimer's disease, based on the observation that people who take anti-inflammatory medications for chronic conditions such as arthritis or other immune disorders seem to have lower rates of Alzheimer's disease. Drugs called statins, which are used to lower cholesterol, may also have some benefit; cholesterol in the brain contributes to the formation of waxy buildups called amyloid plaques, which are linked to Alzheimer's disease.\n\nKeep in mind that none of these therapies has yet been scientifically proven to be effective in preventing Alzheimer's disease, and many doctors are waiting for further evidence before recommending them to patients.

In ALS, motor neurons gradually deteriorate, causing muscles to weaken and waste away, which eventually leads to paralysis. ALS usually occurs after age 40 and affects more men than women. Its cause is not known.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nIn ALS, the affected parts of the body become increasingly weak, with twitching and cramping in the muscles. The person has difficulty swallowing, breathing, and walking. The disease eventually affects all of the body's motor functions. In the final stages of ALS, a person is unable to speak or move, but his or her intellect and awareness are unchanged.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nDiagnosis of ALS is based on the symptoms and the results of diagnostic tests such as an electromyogram (an evaluation of the electrical activity of muscle tissue) and a muscle biopsy (a diagnostic test in which samples of muscle cells are examined under a microscope). An MRI (see page 113) and blood tests may be done to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nALS cannot be prevented or cured. Treatment focuses on relieving the discomfort and helping the person remain as mobile and independent as possible for as long as possible. Doctors may prescribe a medication called riluzole to help slow the course of the disease. Specialized ALS treatment centers in many states offer comprehensive support services and treatment to help relieve symptoms; ask your doctor to recommend one. A person may eventually need a ventilator to assist with breathing, and feeding through a tube when he or she can no longer swallow. Most people with ALS die within 5 years of diagnosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Infections of the Brain and Nervous System**]\nInfections of the brain and nervous system are less common than infections in other parts of the body because the brain and spinal cord have no direct contact with the environment. However, infections in the nervous system can cause severe symptoms and can be life-threatening. The bacteria, viruses, and other organisms that cause these infections gain entry to the brain and nervous system through the sinuses, the air spaces in the ears, the bloodstream, or fractures in the skull. Early treatment can prevent long-term damage to the nervous system and can be lifesaving.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Meningitis]\nMeningitis is inflammation of the meninges (the membranes that surround and protect the brain and spinal cord), usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection. The severity of meningitis depends on the infection-causing microorganism. The infection may have traveled to the brain from a localized infection (such as a sinus or ear infection), from the blood as part of a more widespread infection (such as a respiratory infection), or from outside the body through a fracture in the skull. Like many viral or bacterial infections, meningitis can occur in epidemics (usually in winter, when people are in close contact indoors).\n\nThe most common cause of meningitis is a virus that is spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Viral meningitis (also called aseptic meningitis) is usually relatively mild. Most of the time, a person with viral meningitis will recover in a few days or weeks. Symptoms of viral meningitis may be uncomfortable but usually do not cause permanent damage to the nervous system.\n\nUntreated bacterial meningitis can be fatal or cause permanent brain or nerve damage, including blindness, deafness, or mental deterioration. Infants and young children, older people, or people who have an impaired immune system (such as those who have a chronic illness or who are taking drugs that suppress the immune system) have an increased risk of permanent nerve damage and death.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Vaccination for Meningitis]\nWidespread immunization of American children has markedly reduced the incidence of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), which used to be the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in children. Because bacterial meningitis can be life-threatening, many doctors recommend that people who are at risk of developing the infection be vaccinated against it. People who are at increased risk include the very young or very old, people who live in close contact (such as in military housing or college dormitories), and people with an impaired immune system (such as those who have a chronic illness or who are taking drugs that suppress the immune system). Vaccines are also available for infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis (which causes meningococcal meningitis) and Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nA severe headache, a stiff neck, abnormal sensitivity of the eyes to light (photophobia), nausea and vomiting, and fever us", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "ALS", "relation": "affects", "tail": "muscles"}, {"head": "ALS", "relation": "affects", "tail": "body's motor functions"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

In mild cases, symptoms may be limited to fever, headache, and fatigue. Encephalitis is usually accompanied by meningitis (see previous article), and a person may also have a stiff neck. In severe cases, especially if a person has herpes simplex encephalitis, brain function is affected more, causing confusion, odd behavior, irritability, or restlessness. A person may also have muscle weakness in the arms and legs, muscle spasms, loss of coordination and balance, speech or vision impairment, or seizures. The infection can sometimes lead to coma and death.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have symptoms of encephalitis, your doctor will recommend that you have a CT scan (see page 112) or MRI (see page 113) of your brain, and an electroencephalogram (EEG; see page 687) to evaluate the electrical activity of your brain. A lumbar puncture (see previous page) is done to help identify the disease-causing organism. In rare cases, a biopsy of the brain is done to make a diagnosis. Blood tests may be repeated after several weeks to test for antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) to various microorganisms that can cause encephalitis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nLife-threatening types of encephalitis (such as those caused by the herpes simplex virus) are treated with antiviral drugs such as acyclovir. In people who have a weakened immune system, an infection caused by the cytomegalovirus or the varicella-zoster virus may respond to treatment with antiviral drugs such as ganciclovir, foscarnet, or\n\ncidofovir. Encephalitis associated with toxoplasmosis can be treated effectively with a combination of sulfadiazine (a sulfa drug) and pyrimethamine (an antimalarial drug).\n\nMost of the other viruses that cause encephalitis do not respond to treatment with medication. For these cases, treatment consists of relieving the symptoms and allowing the immune system to eliminate the virus. Your doctor may prescribe corticosteroid drugs to reduce the swelling in your brain from the inflammation. If the muscles that assist breathing are affected, you will be put on a ventilator. If swallowing is impaired, you may need to be fed intravenously (through a vein). In severe cases, recovery may be slow and incomplete and a person may need therapy to relearn basic skills such as speaking.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Polio]\nPolio (short for poliomyelitis) is a viral infection that affects muscle-controlling nerves in the brain and spinal cord. The virus, which is spread by contact with an infected person or by eating or drinking contaminated food or liquids, usually causes only a mild infection. Widespread, mandatory vaccination (see page 374) of children in developed countries (such as the United States) has almost eliminated the infection in those countries. A person who has had polio may, years later, experience muscle deterioration, pain, or weakness in previously affected muscles; this condition is called postpolio syndrome.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Polio > Polio Booster for Foreign Travel]\nIf you or members of your family are going to travel to a country in which polio still occurs—such as many developing countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia—ask your doctor if you should have a polio booster before you leave.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Polio > *Symptoms*]\nThe early symptoms of polio include headache, stomachache, sore throat, fever, and diarrhea. The symptoms may begin suddenly and last only a few days. In a small percentage of cases, polio invades the brain and develops into a severe infection, with\n\npain and stiffness in the neck, back, and legs. In severe cases, muscles (including the muscles that control breathing) may become weak and cause paralysis or, sometimes, death.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have recently traveled abroad or have not been vaccinated against polio and have symptoms of polio (such as fever and pain in your muscles, neck, and back), your doctor will take a sample of saliva from your throat or a stool sample to determine if the polio virus is the cause. He or she will also recommend a lumbar puncture (see page 693), in which a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (the liquid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord) is taken from the spinal canal and examined under a microscope to look for inflammation or the presence of infection-fighting white blood cells and proteins.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThere is no cure for polio. Most infections do not result in permanent damage. In people who are paralyzed from polio, physical therapy can help retain muscle function and limit further muscle damage. If breathing has been affected, a ventilator may be necessary to assist breathing. For people with postpolio syndrome, treatment may involve pain medication, physical therapy, and the use of a brace for parts of the body that are weakened, such as the legs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > **Epidural Abscess**]\nAn ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "encephalitis", "relation": "accompanied by", "tail": "meningitis"}, {"head": "encephalitis", "relation": "causes", "tail": "confusion"}, {"head": "encephalitis", "relation": "causes", "tail": "odd behavior"}, {"head": "encephalitis", "relation": "causes", "tail": "irritability"}, {"head": "encephalitis", "relation": "causes", "tail": "restlessness"}, {"head": "encephalitis", "relation": "causes", "tail": "muscle weakness in the arms and legs"}, {"head": "encephalitis", "relation": "causes", "tail": "muscle spasms"}, {"head": "encephalitis", "relation": "causes", "tail": "loss of coordination and balance"}, {"head": "encephalitis", "relation": "causes", "tail": "speech or vision impairment"}, {"head": "encephalitis", "relation": "causes", "tail": "seizures"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "person", "relation": "have", "tail": "[Event: symptoms of encephalitis]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "recommend", "tail": "[Event: CT scan]"}, {"head": "infection", "relation": "lead to", "tail": "[Event: coma and death]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: coma and death]"}]}, "status": "success"}

In multiple sclerosis, the myelin in random locations in the central nervous system becomes inflamed, swollen, and damaged, which interferes with the normal transmission of electrical impulses.\n\nDiagram of a Healthy nerve cell (neuron). Labels include: Nerve cell body, Myelin sheath, and Nerve fiber.\n\n![](_page_1276_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nDiagram of a Nerve cell damaged by multiple sclerosis. Labels include: Nerve cell body, Damaged myelin sheath, and Unprotected nerve fiber.\n\n![](_page_1276_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nAlthough the cause of MS is unknown, researchers think it may result from a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors such as a viral infection that occurs early in life. Some evidence suggests that people who spend the first 15 years of life in a temperate climate have an increased risk of developing MS compared with people who live in the tropics. MS can run in families. Whites are twice as likely as blacks to develop MS, and women are twice as likely as men to develop the disease. Most people who have MS live a normal life span.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of MS usually appear between ages 15 and 50. Dizziness is an early symptom of the disease. Later symptoms include blurred vision, numbness and tingling, muscle weakness, fatigue, loss of balance and coordination, tremors (trembling), stiffness, and slurred speech. Initially, symptoms may come and go. In the later stages of the disease, symptoms may worsen. As the disease progresses, a person may develop muscle spasms, urinary tract infections, constipation, loss of bowel and bladder control, sexual dysfunction, depression, or mood swings. Many people experience problems with concentration, memory, and judgment, although their language skills do not change. Symptoms may worsen when the person's body temperature rises—such as after exercise or a hot bath, during a fever, or when the environmental temperature is high. Repeated episodes of MS can cause progressive nerve damage that significantly limits activity and movement. This nerve damage can make recovery after later episodes more difficult and may lead to permanent disability.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have symptoms of MS, your doctor will recommend that you see a neurologist (a doctor who specializes in treating disorders of the nervous system). A diagnosis of MS is usually based on a person's neurological history; a neurological examination that includes tests to evaluate the functioning of the nervous system, such as vision, reflexes, hearing, sensation, movement, and balance and coordination; and an MRI (see page 113), which may show damage to the nerve pathways and changes in brain tissue characteristic of MS.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > **The effects of multiple sclerosis**]\nBecause the brain and spinal cord control all parts of the body, damage to the central nervous system from multiple sclerosis can affect many different organs and functions.\n\nDiagram illustrating the effects of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) on various systems of the body:\n\n- **Brain and spinal cord:** (weakness; loss of balance and coordination; dizziness; numbness, tingling, and loss of sensation, especially in the hands and feet; slurred speech; personality changes; problems with concentration and memory)\n- **Eyes:** (blurred vision, temporary loss of vision in the center of the visual field)\n- **", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "prednisone", "relation": "treats", "tail": "Bell's palsy"}, {"head": "acyclovir", "relation": "prescribes", "tail": "herpes simplex virus infection"}, {"head": "corticosteroid medication", "relation": "reduces", "tail": "inflammation"}, {"head": "antiviral medication", "relation": "relieves", "tail": "pain"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "prescribes", "tail": "[Event: corticosteroid medication]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "prescribes", "tail": "[Event: antiviral medication]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "wears", "tail": "[Event: protective eye patch]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: herpes simplex virus infection]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment]"}, {"head": "[Event: weakness in face improves]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: recovery]"}]}, "status": "success"}

The pain is generally worse at night. In severe cases, a person with carpal tunnel syndrome may develop permanent numbness and a weak grip. In ulnar tunnel syndrome, the tingling, burning, and numbness occur along the ulnar nerve.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome, your doctor will ask you questions about any activities that could be causing the disorder and will perform a thorough physical examination to rule out other medical conditions. He or she may ask you to do some simple maneuvers with your hand and wrist to see if the movements cause symptoms. Although X-rays are not useful in diagnosing carpal tunnel syndrome, your doctor may order X-rays to rule out other disorders, such as arthritis or fractured bones. You are likely to have diagnostic tests such as a nerve conduction velocity test (to measure how fast your nerves transmit impulses) and electromyography (to evaluate your muscle activity).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > **Repetitive Stress Injuries**]\nChronic upper limb pain syndrome, cumulative trauma disorder, overuse syndrome, repetitive motion disorder, repetitive strain syndrome, and repetitive stress disorder are general terms for injuries to part of the hand or arm caused by repetitive movements of the wrist or hand. These disorders can affect nerves, muscles, tendons, or connective tissue. Carpal tunnel syndrome, ulnar tunnel syndrome, tendinitis (see page 984), and bursitis (see page 1002) are a few examples of repetitive stress injuries.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe basic treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome and ulnar tunnel syndrome is to relieve the compression of the affected nerve. Varying your activities and adjusting your workstation may be enough to relieve your symptoms. Rest and limit flexing of your wrist by using a wrist splint or brace (which allows the swollen tissues to shrink and relieves pressure on the median nerve). Use over-the-counter pain relievers such as aspirin or ibuprofen. If they don't ease symptoms, your doctor may inject a corticosteroid or other anti-inflammatory medication into your wrist to reduce inflammation and ease pain. If you still have weakness or pain, a surgeon can relieve pressure on the median nerve by opening the space for the median nerve in a minor surgical procedure.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Preventing Carpal Tunnel Syndrome*]\nAlthough it is not always possible to prevent a stress injury such as carpal tunnel syndrome, the following steps can help reduce your risk:\n\n- Lose weight if you're overweight (excess fat in the wrist can compress the nerve).\n- Get treatment for any disorder, such as arthritis, that may be contributing to your carpal tunnel syndrome.\n- Switch hands frequently during tasks.\n- Don't rest your wrist on hard surfaces for long periods.\n- Adjust your work position to reduce flexing of the wrists.\n- Avoid bending, twisting, or extending your hands for long periods; take frequent breaks from repeated hand movements to give your hands and wrists some rest.\n- Avoid working with your arms too close to or too far from your body.\n- Don't use tools that are too large for your hands.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Proper position of wrists when using a keyboard]\nIf you use a keyboard for long periods, position your keyboard at a height at which you don't have to bend your wrists up or down while you type. Your elbows should bend at a 90-degree angle and your forearms should be parallel to the floor. To make these adjustments, try either raising your chair or lowering your keyboard.\n\n![Diagram showing a hand typing on a keyboard with the wrist in an incorrect position, labeled 'Incorrect position of wrist'.]()![](_page_1283_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n![Diagram showing a hand typing on a keyboard with the wrist in a correct position, labeled 'Correct position of wrist'.]()![](_page_1283_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Trigeminal Neuralgia]\nTrigeminal neuralgia, also called tic douloureux, is severe facial pain resulting from a damaged trigeminal nerve, one of the major nerves in the face. The cause of trigeminal neuralgia is unknown. The disorder usually occurs in older people, when a twisted artery presses on the trigeminal nerve. It sometimes occurs in younger people who have multiple sclerosis (see page 696). Trigeminal neuralgia can be temporary or chronic.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Trigeminal Neuralgia > Trigeminal nerve]\nThe trigeminal nerve, which supplies sensation to the scalp, face, eyes, nose, mouth, teeth, sinuses, tongue, and jaw muscles, divides into three main branches—the ophthalmic branch, the maxillary branch, and the mandibular branch.

A doctor may prescribe a long-acting medication such as pyridostigmine to restore transmission of nerve impulses to the affected muscles and increase muscle strength. He or she also may prescribe corticosteroids or immune-suppressing drugs to reduce inflammation and inhibit the errant immune response. Infusions of human immune globulin also can help counteract the body's faulty immune response. A treatment called plasmapheresis, which filters antibodies from the blood, helps some people recover from acute episodes. Doctors often recommend surgery to remove the thymus, which can eliminate the symptoms of myasthenia gravis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Peripheral Neuropathy]\nPeripheral neuropathy is damage to the peripheral nerves (the nerves that spread out from the brain and spinal cord). Peripheral neuropathy sometimes occurs as a result of nerve inflammation or as a complication of disorders or conditions such as diabetes, alcoholism, deficiencies of vitamins B or E, AIDS, cancer, kidney disease, or vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels). Some neuropathies occur as inherited conditions that run in families. Peripheral neuropathy can also be caused by overexposure to some medications (such as the drugs used in chemotherapy; see page 23) and by exposure to toxic chemicals such as insecticides or metals such as lead, arsenic, or mercury.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of peripheral neuropathy usually develop gradually over many months and include tingling, numbness, and pain in the feet and later in the hands. The symptoms sometimes spread slowly along the arms and legs to the trunk. In some cases the muscles of the feet, hands, and legs gradually weaken and may atrophy (waste away). When autonomic nerves are affected, impairments in sweating or in bladder, stomach, or bowel function may occur.\n\nEarly diagnosis is important because the nerve damage may not be reversible, depending on the cause.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf your doctor suspects that you have peripheral neuropathy, he or she may refer you to a neurologist (a doctor who specializes in disorders of the nervous system), who will perform a physical examination, test you for signs of muscle weakness and sensory loss, and check your reflexes. He or she may ask you questions about your general health and your family's health history to determine if a hereditary condition may have caused the nerve damage. The neurologist may perform the following tests: blood tests to check vitamin levels and look for evidence of diabetes, thyroid disease, or inflammatory conditions; a nerve conduction velocity test to measure how fast your nerves transmit impulses; and electromyography to evaluate your nerve and muscle activity. The neurologist also may take a biopsy (sample of tissue) from a small nerve in the ankle called the sural nerve to look for the cause of the neuropathy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe treatment of peripheral neuropathy depends on the cause. For example, a doctor will prescribe vitamins to treat a vitamin deficiency, and corticosteroids or drugs that suppress the immune system to treat an inflammatory disorder such as vasculitis. A person with diabetes will be given medication to lower blood sugar, and a person with abnormal thyroid function will be given medication to correct it. In severe cases of irreversible neuropathy, treatment includes physical therapy, the use of assistive equipment (such as canes, walkers, bath rails, and grab bars), and prevention of sores and infections that could result from injuries caused by the person's inability to feel pain.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Guillain-Barré Syndrome]\nGuillain-Barré syndrome, also called acute inflammatory polyneuropathy or idiopathic polyneuritis, is a potentially severe form of peripheral neuropathy (see previous article) resulting from a faulty immune response that can follow a viral infection such as the flu, a cold, mononucleosis (see page 935), or diarrhea. The condition affects the peripheral nerves (the nerves that spread out from the brain and spinal cord). Infection-fighting antibodies and white blood cells of the immune system confuse the nerves with the virus (because the nerves and the virus have a similar molecular structure) and mistakenly attack the nerves. The nerve damage and muscle weakness caused by Guillain-Barré syndrome usually are temporary—most people recover from even severe cases. Recovery time ranges from a few weeks to a year or more.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Guillain-Barré Syndrome > *Symptoms*]\nSymptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome usually develop within about 3 to 4 weeks after a viral infection but can develop within a few hours.

Insomnia can cause serious problems—including drowsiness, diminished energy, poor concentration, irritability, and a greater risk of accidents—during the day. Work performance and personal relationships often suffer.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Q & A > Sleep]\n**Q.** *I read somewhere that many famous people, such as Thomas Edison, got by on very little sleep. There is so much to do and so little time. How can I make a few hours of sleep work for me?*\n\n**A.** You can't. Cutting down on your sleep will make you less productive, not more. Sleep is necessary to refresh your tired brain, organize the day's experiences, and stimulate hormones that build and repair body tissues. It has been said that Edison slept 6 hours a night, but the untold part of the story is\n\nthat he was able to fall asleep quickly and took naps frequently throughout the day, possibly up to two 2-hour naps a day—a total of 10 hours a day.\n\n**Q.** *I'm a 20-year-old college student and I frequently pull all-nighters to study for early-morning tests. My roommate told me that I'm not doing myself any good and, I have to admit, my grades don't reflect the amount of time I spend studying. What am I doing wrong?*\n\n**A.** Staying awake longer than normal can impair your memory. Essentially, learning is about forming permanent memories. People remember more of what they have learned if they have sufficient sleep right after studying. A few hours won't do. In the last few hours of dream sleep, the brain concentrates on strengthening and reinforcing the connections between nerve cells that make up a new memory. A good night's sleep helps the brain organize and retrieve information.\n\nA number of factors can cause insomnia. Many people experience short-term or intermittent insomnia when they are under increased stress, have jet lag (see next page), or sleep in a noisy environment. The side effects of some medications also can cause insomnia. Certain conditions, such as depression (see page 709) or anxiety (see page 718), seem to make people more susceptible to insomnia. Although the disorder affects people of all age groups, it occurs more often in women (especially after menopause) and older people.\n\nThe causes of chronic insomnia are often complicated, involving a number of underlying physical or psychological disorders. Depression is one of the most frequent causes of long-term insomnia. Other disorders, such as arthritis (see page 996), kidney disease, heart failure (see page 570), asthma (see page 640), multiple sclerosis (see page 696), Parkinson's disease (see page 691), and hyperthyroidism (see page 901), also are common causes of insomnia. Other sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea (see page 636) and restless legs syndrome (see next page), can also cause insomnia.\n\nYour risk of having insomnia increases if you smoke (because nicotine is a stimulant that disrupts sleep) or if you consume too much alcohol or caffeine, or use other stimulants before bedtime. Shift work or other activities that promote irregular sleep patterns also can affect your ability to fall asleep and stay asleep. Excessive worrying (including worrying about not being able to sleep) can contribute to insomnia. Making lifestyle changes is often enough to improve your sleep.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe difficulty sleeping that is characteristic of insomnia falls into three main classes—short-term, intermittent, and chronic. Short-term or transient insomnia usually lasts only a few weeks or less. Short-term insomnia that occurs from time to time is said to be intermittent. Chronic or long-term insomnia happens on most nights and persists for a month or longer.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have insomnia, your doctor will take a detailed health history (see page 130), including a sleep history. You may be asked to keep a sleep diary to find out how much sound sleep you get each night. The doctor may also ask your sleep partner about the quality of your sleep and how long you sleep each night.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nShort-term and intermittent insomnia may need no medical treatment if the doctor thinks the insomnia can be taken care of with lifestyle adjustments, such as reducing caffeine or alcohol consumption. If the problem persists or causes excessive daytime sleepiness and impaired performance, a doctor may prescribe a short-acting sleep medication for a brief period of time. Doctors usually do not recommend using over-the-counter medications to treat insomnia. Some doctors are prescribing the hormone melatonin (which resets the body's sleep cycle) for some people who have insomnia; ask your doctor about it.\n\nTo treat chronic insomnia, your doctor will diagnose and treat any medical or psychologic", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "insomnia", "relation": "causes", "tail": "drowsiness"}, {"head": "insomnia", "relation": "causes", "tail": "diminished energy"}, {"head": "insomnia", "relation": "causes", "tail": "poor concentration"}, {"head": "insomnia", "relation": "causes", "tail": "irritability"}, {"head": "insomnia", "relation": "causes", "tail": "greater risk of accidents"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "people who have insomnia", "relation": "get", "tail": "[Event: insufficient sleep or poor-quality sleep]"}, {"head": "people who have insomnia", "relation": "experience", "tail": "[Event: difficulty falling asleep]"}, {"head": "people who have insomnia", "relation": "wake up often and cannot fall back asleep", "tail": "[Event: wake up too early in the morning]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: cutting down on sleep]", "relation": "makes you less productive", "tail": "[Event: not effective for work performance]"}, {"head": "[Event: insomnia]", "relation": "cause serious problems", "tail": "[Event: drowsiness, diminished energy, poor concentration, irritability, and a greater risk of accidents]"}]}, "status": "success"}

The symptoms worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, or during the evening or at night. A person with restless legs syndrome may have periodic involuntary jerking in his or her legs or arms while asleep. Involuntary movements of the toes, feet, or legs can make a person with restless legs syndrome appear fidgety.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nThere are no tests for diagnosing restless legs syndrome. A diagnosis is usually made from the symptoms and from the information a person gives the doctor. Sometimes an underlying condition such as iron deficiency anemia, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, or hormonal changes during pregnancy or menopause produce symptoms of restless legs syndrome. In these cases, the symptoms usually subside once the condition is treated (or after childbirth). Some medications—such as calcium channel blockers (used for treating high blood pressure and heart disease), antinausea drugs, some cold and allergy medications, some tranquilizers (including haloperidol and phenothiazines), the antiseizure medication phenytoin, and antidepressant medications—can worsen the symptoms of restless legs syndrome.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nDoctors frequently recommend medication for treating restless legs syndrome. The drugs most often prescribed include benzodiazepines (which induce sleep by depressing\n\nthe central nervous system) or dopaminergic agents (usually used to reduce tremors in people with Parkinson's disease). The effectiveness of a medication depends on the severity of the symptoms.\n\nPeople who have a less severe form of restless legs syndrome may find relief from the symptoms by walking, stretching, taking hot or cold baths, or practicing relaxation techniques or yoga. Lifestyle changes such as limiting consumption of caffeine and alcohol and eating a healthy, balanced diet also may help lessen the symptoms.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Narcolepsy]\nNarcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder in which a person is overcome by such overwhelming sleepiness that he or she falls asleep at inappropriate times (for example, while eating dinner or having a conversation) during the day. These daytime \"sleep attacks\" are uncontrollable and often occur without warning. The sleep attacks appear to occur when the messages about sleep and waking sent by the brain to other parts of the body deviate from their normal course or arrive at the wrong time. This process causes a disturbance in the normal order and length of sleep stages, so that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, when dreaming occurs, happens at sleep onset or even during the day. The person usually remains conscious.\n\nStrong emotions such as anger, fear, or laughter, or strenuous physical activity often trigger these episodes. Some attacks can be accompanied by loss of muscle function and total body collapse, a condition called cataplexy.\n\nNarcolepsy often interferes with a person's job and personal life and restricts his or her activities. Roughly 1 in 2,000 people has narcolepsy, which can occur in people of all ages, although symptoms usually begin between ages 15 and 30. Narcolepsy seems to run in families, but it is often misdiagnosed as depression (see page 709), epilepsy (see page 686), or the side effects of medication. The length of time between the appearance of symptoms and a diagnosis of narcolepsy can be up to 15 years.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nOverwhelming daytime sleepiness at inappropriate times is usually the first symptom of narcolepsy. People with narcolepsy also may experience sleep paralysis, in which their body becomes temporarily immobile during the time they fall asleep or wake up. A person may have intense, often frightening hallucinations (abnormal perceptions not based on reality) when he or she dozes off or falls asleep. Affected people sometimes\n\ndisplay automatic behavior, in which they perform routine tasks repeatedly without full awareness that they are doing so.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nAfter performing a thorough physical examination and taking a detailed health history, your doctor will probably order two tests to diagnose narcolepsy. The first, called polysomnography, measures brain waves, heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and muscle movements during sleep. The second, the multiple sleep latency test, measures how fast you fall asleep when given a chance to nap every few hours. Both tests can be performed in a sleep laboratory or at home.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTo treat narcolepsy, your doctor will tailor a treatment plan to your individual needs, depending on the severity of your symptoms. Medications called central nervous system stimulants are the recommended treatment for narcolepsy. These drugs promote wakefulness during the day to reduce the effects of excessive daytime sleepiness.\n\nAntidepressant ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "restless legs syndrome", "relation": "worsen during", "tail": "periods of rest or inactivity"}, {"head": "restless legs syndrome", "relation": "appear as", "tail": "involuntary movements of the toes, feet, or legs"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "person with restless legs syndrome", "relation": "have", "tail": "[Event: periodic involuntary jerking in his or her legs or arms while asleep]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "make a diagnosis from", "tail": "[Event: symptoms and information given by the person]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: periods of rest or inactivity]", "relation": "cause", "tail": "[Event: worsening of restless legs syndrome]"}, {"head": "[Event: evening or at night]", "relation": "cause", "tail": "[Event: worsening of restless legs syndrome]"}]}, "status": "success"}

During this time, the primary symptoms are overriding melancholy, despair, and hopelessness. The person becomes apathetic and loses interest in enjoyable activities, including sex. It is also common for a person with depression to have difficulty concentrating. He or she may show signs of agitation, such as pacing or hand wringing, along with slowed speech and response time. Fatigue can be so great that even the smallest everyday tasks, such as dressing, seem to require enormous effort.\n\nDepressed people often feel a diminished sense of self-worth—so much so that they may unreasonably feel responsible for unfavorable events that are beyond their control. For example, a salesman may blame himself for failing to make sales even when the general economy is bad and most other salespeople are also missing their sales targets. The intensity of symptoms often varies with the time of day. Often, a depressed person wakes up early with almost no energy but improves as the day goes on, although some people experience worse symptoms at night. As the disorder progresses, depression may deepen until it becomes chronic and the person may become totally withdrawn.\n\nCharacteristic symptoms of depression can change with age. Depressed children may express vague physical discomforts (such as a stomachache), be irritable, cry a lot, express a fear of death, or withdraw socially. They may also be extremely sensitive to rejection or failure. Adolescents who have depression often sleep excessively, display disruptive or reckless behavior, are frequently absent from school or perform poorly in school, and abuse alcohol or drugs. They may also have a concurrent anxiety disorder (see page 718).\n\nThe most serious risk of depression is suicide. If you think that you or someone you know may be depressed, talk to your doctor immediately. Untreated, depression often persists and can worsen, with episodes occurring more frequently and becoming more severe over time. This is why it is so important to seek treatment early.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Risks and Warning Signs of Suicide]\nRecognizing and treating depression and other mental disorders as early as possible can be lifesaving. About 70 percent of people who commit suicide or attempt it are depressed. Always take a suicide attempt—even just talking about suicide—very seriously. Attempted suicide is always a plea for help from someone who is combating a mental disorder or a substance abuse problem. If someone you know threatens to commit suicide, listen to him or her without judgment, try to get him or her to see a doctor or call a suicide hot line, or call a suicide hot line yourself.\n\nWomen attempt suicide more often than do men, but men are four times as likely to be successful. More than 20 percent of adolescents seriously consider suicide each year, and the risk increases with age. The highest suicide rate occurs in white males over age 85. The following factors put a person at risk of committing suicide:\n\n- Having previously attempted suicide\n- Having a mental disorder\n- Having a family history of a mental disorder, substance abuse, suicide, or physical or sexual abuse\n- Keeping a firearm in the home\n- Being imprisoned\n- Being exposed to the suicidal behavior of others, including media exposure\n\nA suicide attempt often follows clearly visible warning signs such as the following:\n\n- Talking about suicide or death, even jokingly\n- Having problems coping with an adverse life event (such as job loss or the death of a loved one)\n- Withdrawing from friends and activities\n- Hoarding pills or purchasing a gun\n- Abusing alcohol or other drugs\n- Giving away prized possessions\n- Showing a lack of interest in the future\n- Writing notes or poems about death\n- Changing eating or sleep habits\n- Neglecting personal appearance\n\n- Behaving impulsively\n\nThe best way to prevent someone from attempting suicide is to get professional help for him or her immediately. Limiting access to firearms also helps; nearly 60 percent of suicides in the United States are committed with a firearm. If someone you know is in immediate danger, call 911 or your local emergency number.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have symptoms of depression, your doctor will perform a thorough physical and psychological evaluation. You will probably receive a neurological examination that assesses the functioning of your brain and nervous system by testing your coordination, reflexes, and balance. The doctor may also order blood and other laboratory tests to rule out any medical conditions that could be causing your symptoms.

It is not clear how these medications work, but they have tranquilizing properties; they may work by interfering with the activity of dopamine (a chemical messenger in the brain). Sometimes these drugs completely reverse the psychosis after treatment. In other cases, medications have to be taken indefinitely. Weight gain is a common side effect of antipsychotic medications, but a potentially long-term effect is the appearance of involuntary movements. Examples of antipsychotic medications include chlorpromazine, thioridazine, molindone, trifluoperazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, and haloperidol.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Newer Antipsychotics*]\nAlthough the exact way in which the newer, atypical antipsychotic medications work is not fully understood, they seem to have an effect on dopamine and serotonin, two neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) in the brain. Examples include clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTreatment of depression usually is a combination of medication and some form of psychotherapy. The form of therapy most frequently used to treat depression is cognitive-behavioral therapy, which can help you learn the underlying cause of your depression, develop skills to cope, and teach you how to transform your negative ways of thinking and behaving into more positive ones. Some depressed people also benefit from interpersonal therapy, which helps them learn how to interact more effectively with other people.\n\nAntidepressant medications (see previous page) such as tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) work by evening out the balance of the brain chemicals serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. These medications can have unpleasant side effects such as dry mouth, drowsiness, constipation, headaches, nausea, or insomnia, but these side effects subside as your body adjusts to the medication. Newer antidepressants, called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), are as effective as the older drugs but with fewer side effects. You will have to take an antidepressant for a few weeks before you see an improvement in your mood.\n\nYou may have to try more than one drug before you and your doctor find the one that works best for you. Some people respond better to one drug or a combination of drugs than to others. Doctors prescribe antidepressant medications for a fixed period—usually 6 to 18 months—but the beneficial effects usually last long after you stop taking the drug. Many people experience anxiety along with their depression, so doctors sometimes also prescribe antianxiety medications (see previous page) for people who have depression.\n\nIn severe cases, depression may require hospitalization, especially if a person has contemplated or attempted suicide. In the hospital, the doctor will monitor the person's condition carefully and begin treatment with drugs and psychotherapy. Temporary care in a day hospital may make it easier for a person to make the transition from the hospital to home. In a day hospital, you receive treatment at a care facility during the day and return home at night.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > MY STORY > Depression]\nMy husband died 3 years ago and I felt horrible for months. I found myself crying all the time, wanting to stay in bed all day, and avoiding my friends and even my children. Life didn't seem worth living. I used to love spending time with my grand-children, taking them to movies and museums, but even that no longer seemed fun. My old friends kept calling me and inviting me to dinner or out to lunch and I always made up excuses not to go. I felt that no one wanted to spend time with me anyway because I was such a mope—they were just trying to be nice.\n\n*I'm grateful that my daughter pushed me to do something about my depression—I was beginning to think I would never enjoy life again.*\n\nThen one day my daughter came over to the house and sat down with me and told me how worried she was about me. She said that the children kept asking her what was wrong with Grandma and why didn't I like to be with them anymore. She said that they all missed our big family dinners together and talked about the fun we used to have whenever we got together. She suggested that I talk to my doctor about how sad I felt all the time, but I dismissed her, saying, \"There's nothing that can be done about the way I feel, so why bother?\" She told me that a friend of hers had had a severe bout of\n\ndepression after her second child was born and she was able to get help from her doctor and is now feeling much better.\n\nEven though I had no energy and little interest in doing anything for myself, my daughter seemed so upset that I finally agreed to talk to my doctor at my next appointment.

But your doctor will perform a physical examination to rule out any physical disorder that could be causing the symptoms. If no physical conditions are detected, the doctor will probably refer you to a psychiatrist or other mental health professional, who can diagnose bipolar disorder based on your health history and a description of your feelings and behavior.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nAlthough bipolar disorder is a condition that occurs in episodes, treatment must be continuous to prevent the severe mood swings that are characteristic of the disorder. A regimen that combines medication and psychotherapy (see page 710) is usually the most effective. Affected people who are experiencing a severe episode of mania or depression may need to be hospitalized for treatment. If they are a danger to themselves or others or if they are unable to care for themselves, they may need to be hospitalized against their will.\n\nDoctors usually prescribe drugs called mood stabilizers (see page 713) to treat bipolar disorder. The drugs may need to be taken indefinitely to control a person's\n\nmood. The most common mood stabilizer prescribed for bipolar disorder is lithium, a naturally occurring mineral, which seems to act on the central nervous system to dampen the manic and depressive phases of the disorder. The dosage of lithium needs to be carefully controlled because a toxic dose is very close to the dose needed to control symptoms. For this reason, if you are taking lithium, you will need to have regular checkups and blood tests to measure the levels of lithium in your blood. Too much lithium can cause weight gain, severe trembling, dizziness, confusion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and heart palpitations. Lithium also can affect the functioning of the thyroid gland. As an alternative to lithium, antiseizure drugs such as divalproex are sometimes prescribed to stabilize mood. For maximum effect, doctors sometimes combine lithium with an anticonvulsant drug.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Rapid Cycling and Cyclothymia]\nRapid cycling is a form of bipolar disorder in which the episodes of mania and depression occur at least four times a year. In serious cases (called ultrarapid cycling), the episodes can occur several times a day. Up to 20 percent of all people with bipolar disorder develop rapid cycling at some point in their lives, and 90 percent of those who do are women. Rapid cycling is more common in people with bipolar disorder who have a thyroid abnormality.\n\nLithium is less effective in treating rapid cycling than other forms of bipolar disorder, and antidepressant medications sometimes induce rapid cycling. For these reasons, an antiseizure medication called divalproex is usually used instead; divalproex works by stabilizing the limbic system (the areas of the brain responsible for emotions). Thyroid hormone also may be helpful in treating rapid cycling in people with mood disorders who have thyroid abnormalities.\n\nCyclothymia is a disorder marked by less severe episodes of mania and depression than bipolar disorder, and the episodes last only a few days. The instability produced by these milder episodes of mania can cause such erratic behavior as frequent changes of residence, irregular work attendance, repeated romantic breakups, and an intermittent pattern of alcohol and drug abuse. A rare form, called chronic hypomania, causes predominantly manic episodes and produces a personality that is overly cheerful, impulsive, and excessively energetic.\n\nPeople with cyclothymia have a greater risk of developing bipolar disorder than the general population, but only a third actually go on to develop it. Treatment may not be required for cyclothymia if the person can learn to live within the extremes of his or her temperament. Otherwise, a doctor will prescribe mood stabilizers (see page 713).\n\nTo help treat your bipolar disorder, your doctor will recommend one or more types of psychotherapy to give you support and guidance in coping with the disorder. You and family members may also benefit from joining a support group to share experiences with other people who are going through the same difficulties.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Rapid Cycling and Cyclothymia > Seasonal Affective Disorder]\nSeasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a form of depression that occurs in the fall or winter in response to shorter days with less sunlight. The disorder subsides in the spring or summer as daylight increases. The exact cause of SAD is unclear. The deficiency of light during fall and winter is thought to decrease the level in the brain of the chemical messenger serotonin. Serotonin affects emotions, behavior, and thought. People with SAD may also have altered circadian rhythms, or internal biological clocks, that cause a shift in the signals that indicate when to fall asleep and when to wake up.", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "will refer to", "tail": "psychiatrist"}, {"head": "medication", "relation": "combines with", "tail": "psychotherapy"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "perform", "tail": "[Event: physical examination]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "will refer to", "tail": "[Event: referral to psychiatrist]"}, {"head": "psychiatrist", "relation": "can diagnose", "tail": "[Event: diagnosis of bipolar disorder]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: physical examination]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: referral to psychiatrist]"}, {"head": "[Event: referral to psychiatrist]", "relation": "results in", "tail": "[Event: diagnosis of bipolar disorder]"}]}, "status": "success"}

The amount of light needed to provide effective therapy varies from one person to another. Phototherapy usually is done in the morning or early evening to extend the feeling of daylight. Your doctor will monitor the therapy carefully because of possible side effects such as eyestrain, headache, and insomnia.\n\nIf you have SAD, try to expose yourself to daylight as much as possible. Outdoor light, even on a cloudy day, is brighter and can provide more light than a light box. Daily exercise can be helpful in treating SAD and is especially beneficial when done outdoors. Eating a balanced diet can help to offset cravings for carbohydrates and sweets.\n\nAntidepressant medications (see page 712) may be effective in eliminating or at least reducing the symptoms of SAD. Psychotherapy (see page 710) can often help people with SAD deal with their depression. Some people benefit from a combination of light therapy, medication, and psychotherapy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Anxiety Disorders]\nThe human body evolved a rapid hormonal response system to deal with danger and to ensure survival. Our physical reactions to dangerous or stressful situations—increased heart rate, rapid breathing, tensed muscles—help us survive and succeed. A genuine threat, such as a speeding car heading right for you, provokes this survival response. But people who have an anxiety disorder respond in this way even when they are not faced with a threat or when a threat is only minor. They experience almost constant fear or dread that disrupts their family life and job performance and prevents them from enjoying a full life.\n\nPeople with anxiety disorders seem to have a biological vulnerability that makes them easily aroused by stress. Factors that contribute to an increased risk for anxiety disorders include an inherited tendency, family behavior that may be learned, abnormalities in brain chemistry, and a chemical hypersensitivity to such substances as high levels of carbon dioxide. Traumatic events in childhood, such as physical or sexual abuse, also can bring about an anxiety disorder in childhood or later in life.\n\nAnxiety disorders represent the most common form of psychological illness in the United States— more than 19 million Americans are affected by an anxiety disorder each year. Depression (see page 709) often accompanies an anxiety disorder, which can lead a person who has an anxiety disorder to contemplate suicide (see page 711) at some time in his or her life. The most common anxiety disorders are panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, phobias, acute stress disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Panic Disorder]\nPanic disorder is an anxiety disorder that produces sudden, unexpected episodes of overwhelming fear accompanied by alarming physical symptoms, such as a rapid heartbeat or a choking sensation. Initial episodes often occur when the person is experiencing severe stress such as from overworking or going through a dramatic life event such as getting married. After having the first panic attack, a person often lives in fear of having another attack. This anticipatory fear causes some affected people to limit their activities to avoid situations that could trigger another attack.\n\nPanic disorder can progress to a higher level, known as agoraphobia, in which the person fears being in a place where escaping or finding help might be difficult. Such people avoid being in a crowd, standing in line, going to the store, or riding in cars or on public transportation. In severe cases, people are afraid to leave their home.\n\nPanic attacks appear to occur when the brain's usual way of reacting to a threat, called the flight or fight response, is activated inappropriately. The disorder is twice as common in women as in men. Initial attacks can appear anytime between late adolescence and middle age. Other psychological conditions, including specific phobias (see page 721), social phobia, and depression (see page 709), often coexist with panic disorder.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nPanic disorder causes episodes of extreme terror and dread, accompanied by physical symptoms such as heart palpitations, light-headedness, difficulty breathing, chest pains, hot flashes or cold chills, and tingling or numbness in the hands. The physical symptoms may appear first, making you afraid that you suddenly have a life-threatening condition, such as a heart attack, and are going to die. You may feel that you can't get enough air and you begin breathing rapidly, triggering light-headedness. Some people report feeling waves of energy flowing down their body.\n\nThese episodes of panic accompanied by uncomfortable physical sensations occur unpredictably and take you completely by surprise, tr", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "light therapy", "relation": "treats", "tail": "SAD"}, {"head": "phototherapy", "relation": "provides", "tail": "effective therapy"}, {"head": "daylight", "relation": "extends", "tail": "feeling of daylight"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "monitors", "tail": "[Event: phototherapy]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "exposes", "tail": "[Event: daylight exposure]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "participates in", "tail": "[Event: daily exercise]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: phototherapy]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: side effects]"}, {"head": "[Event: daylight exposure]", "relation": "helps", "tail": "[Event: treating SAD]"}, {"head": "[Event: daily exercise]", "relation": "benefits", "tail": "[Event: treating SAD]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Half of all affected people benefit from these medications. Most doctors also prescribe a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy called desensitization, which exposes the person to a compulsion-producing situation (such as using a public bathroom) while attempting to reduce the compulsive response (such as repeated hand washing).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Posttraumatic Stress Disorder**]\nPosttraumatic stress disorder is a condition that occurs after a terrifying experience, such as a violent personal attack, child abuse, a severe injury, a natural disaster, or military combat. The traumatizing event can be something that the person has either experienced or witnessed. After the incident, the person continues to relive the event through nightmares or intrusive daytime memories called flashbacks. Any traumatizing experience can trigger posttraumatic stress disorder, although not all people who experience a horrifying event develop the disorder. The condition affects millions of Americans. Because some people who have posttraumatic stress disorder are at increased risk of suicide (see page 711), getting prompt treatment can be lifesaving.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nDuring the traumatic event, you may have felt profound fear, helplessness, and horror. Flashbacks cause you to feel that you are reliving the incident, recalling the sounds, odors, and feelings related to the event to the exclusion of physical reality. Even when you are not reliving the event, you may feel numb and detached from your surroundings and be easily startled. You may also have difficulty returning affection and engaging in activities you previously enjoyed. Irritability, aggression or violence, and sleep problems are common. People with posttraumatic stress disorder are highly susceptible to depression (see page 709) and substance abuse (see page 732).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nYour doctor can diagnose posttraumatic stress disorder after listening to a description of your experiences and symptoms. The diagnosis is confirmed if you have had symptoms for more than a month.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nAntidepressant and antianxiety medications (see page 709) can reduce the symptoms of depression and help with sleep problems in people with posttraumatic stress disorder. Psychotherapy (see page 710), especially cognitive-behavioral therapy, which helps to change negative patterns of thought and behavior into more positive ones, can also be helpful. Many people with the disorder find group therapy beneficial because they can share their feelings with others who have had similar experiences.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Phobias**]\nFor people with phobias, certain objects or situations provoke irrational fear so overwhelming that it interferes with normal life. The two main types of phobias are specific phobias and social anxiety disorder. When fear is connected to a particular object, such as bridges, snakes, or water, a person is said to have a specific phobia. Specific phobias can arise at any age. In children, specific phobias are learned, either by experiencing a traumatic event, such as being bitten by a vicious dog, or by observing a parent who is afraid of some object. Adults typically develop specific phobias as a learned response after experiencing intense anxiety in a particular situation, such as being confined in a stalled elevator.\n\nSocial anxiety disorder can involve fear of being humiliated in front of other people. A person may experience a social phobia in most social situations or only at certain times, such as when speaking in public or performing onstage. Social anxiety disorder usually first appears between ages 15 and 20 and occurs equally in men and women. Doctors believe that people who have social anxiety disorder have an inborn tendency to have exaggerated physical responses, such as blushing or increased heart rate, in social situations.\n\nBoth types of phobias run in families. People with phobias may be genetically programmed to easily learn to be fearful, or they may acquire their fear from watching the fearful behavior of others.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nIn both specific phobias and social anxiety disorder, the anxiety produced by the feared object or situation is so great that it produces physical symptoms, including a pounding heart, sweating, and rapid breathing. Anticipation of a situation in which the person might have to face the object of fear can cause loss of sleep and loss of appetite. People with social anxiety disorder have difficulty talking to other people in everyday social situations, both in person and on the telephone. They may blush or shake in front of other people, ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors", "relation": "treats", "tail": "obsessive-compulsive disorder"}, {"head": "desensitization", "relation": "prescribes", "tail": "posttraumatic stress disorder"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctors", "relation": "prescribe", "tail": "[Event: desensitization]"}, {"head": "people", "relation": "benefit from", "tail": "[Event: antidepressant medication]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

The disorder usually first appears in adolescence or early adulthood. The person's behavior is noticeably different from expected behavior. Psychiatrists classify personality disorders into three different clusters. Cluster A personality disorders (paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal) are characterized by odd or eccentric behavior. Cluster B personality disorders (antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic) are marked by dramatic and highly emotional behavior. Cluster C personality disorders (avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive) are typified by anxious, fearful behaviors.\n\nPersonality disorders affect up to 3 percent of the general population. A personality disorder can affect both men and women, but some, such as antisocial personality disorder and paranoid personality disorder, are more prevalent in men.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Personality Disorders > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of a personality disorder depend on the type. It is possible to have a personality disorder that displays traits of more than one type. The disorders described\n\nhere are the most common medically recognized personality disorders.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Personality Disorders > **Paranoid personality disorder**]\nPeople with paranoid personality disorder are so distrustful and suspicious of other people's motives that, without any evidence, they may assume that others intend to harm, exploit, or deceive them. They bear grudges, do not forgive perceived injustices, and react with anger when they think they are being attacked.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Personality Disorders > **Schizoid personality disorder**]\nPeople with schizoid personality disorder are not interested in forming close relationships and seem cold and indifferent. They prefer to be alone and do not express much emotion, including anger. This type of personality disorder is thought to be a limited form of schizophrenia (see page 728) and sometimes eventually becomes schizophrenia.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Personality Disorders > **Schizotypal personality disorder**]\nPeople with a schizotypal personality disorder are uncomfortable in close relationships, seem eccentric, and are preoccupied with superstitions or the paranormal. They may believe they have special powers, such as clairvoyance, or that they have magical control over others. This type of personality disorder is also thought to be a limited form of schizophrenia (see page 728).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Personality Disorders > **Antisocial personality disorder**]\nThe essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is callous disregard for other people's rights or suffering. A person with this disorder may be contemptuous, deceitful, and manipulative and often break the law by destroying property, stealing, or conning other people.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Personality Disorders > **Borderline personality disorder**]\nPeople with borderline personality disorder have a lifelong history of mood instability and fear real or imagined abandonment. They try to counteract it by impulsively entering and ending relationships, engaging in spending sprees, having promiscuous sex, driving recklessly, or abusing drugs or alcohol.\n\nThey lead tempestuous lives and may engage in self-mutilation or attempt suicide. Borderline personality disorder may be related to bipolar disorder (see page 715).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Personality Disorders > **Histrionic personality disorder**]\nAttention-seeking and shallow, exaggerated emotionality characterize histrionic personality disorder. Affected people demand to be the center of attention, are sexually seductive, and are easily influenced by others.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Narcissistic personality disorder]\nPeople with narcissistic personality disorder have an exaggerated sense of self-importance. They assume they are superior to others and feel slighted when their superiority is not recognized. They require excessive admiration, have a sense of entitlement, and exploit others to realize their own ambitions. Doctors think this personality disorder is a limited form of bipolar disorder (see page 715).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Avoidant personality disorder]\nA person with avoidant personality disorder has a lifelong fear of rejection, is preoccupied with feelings of inadequacy, and harbors fears of criticism. He or she longs to have a social life but avoids social gatherings, intimate relationships, and new activities because they may prove embarrassing. This type of personality disorder is thought to be related to social anxiety disorder (see page 721).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Dependent personality disorder]\nThe distinguishing feature of dependent personality disorder is a strong need to be taken care of.

But some people overeat compulsively, frequently consuming huge amounts of food in secret. These people have a binge eating disorder. Binge eating also occurs in another eating disorder called bulimia (see next article), but people with bulimia typically purge their body of food—usually by self-induced vomiting—after they eat. Purging is not a part of binge eating disorder. Binge eating is probably the most common of all the eating disorders. An estimated 2 percent of the adult American population—about 4 million people—may have a binge eating disorder, which affects more women than men.\n\nThe causes of binge eating are unclear, although about half of all people with the disorder also struggle with depression (see page 709). Many people who binge eat report feeling angry, bored, unhappy, or anxious right before an episode of bingeing. Doctors think that affected people may have more difficulty controlling their impulses\n\nthan other people. Inherited tendencies or brain chemical interactions also seem to contribute to the development of binge eating.\n\nBinge eaters face a number of health risks, especially if they are obese. These risks include diabetes, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol levels, gallbladder problems, heart disease, and some types of cancer.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nPeople with a binge eating disorder are typically overweight, although their weight may fluctuate. They engage in regular episodes of overeating in which they consume unusually large amounts of food in a short period of time. They eat quickly, even after feeling full, until they feel uncomfortable. They tend to prefer junk foods that are high in carbohydrates and fat. Binge eaters usually eat alone because they don't want anyone to see how much food they are consuming. Afterward, they often feel guilty, depressed, and angry with themselves for having eaten so much food. They may periodically try to diet to lose the excess weight, but either the diet fails or they soon gain the weight back.\n\nSome people are so obsessed with binge eating that they miss work, school, or social events so they can overeat at home alone. They may reach a point at which they avoid social situations completely because they are so ashamed of their overeating. Many binge eaters have depression.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA doctor can diagnose binge eating by listening to a person's description of his or her feelings and behavior and eating habits.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nBinge eaters think that losing weight will help them feel better about themselves, but the treatment for binge eating focuses on the binge eating rather than weight loss. Some psychotherapeutic methods have proven successful in treating this disorder. Cognitive-behavioral therapy can help a person learn to change his or her negative thoughts and abnormal eating patterns into more positive, healthy thoughts and behaviors.\n\nInterpersonal psychotherapy can help binge eaters look at their relationships with family members and friends to find ways to improve their social interactions and\n\nrelationships. Self-help groups offer a source of encouragement and allow people to share useful information and their experiences and ways of overcoming their problem. Some people with a binge eating disorder may also benefit from antidepressant medications (see page 712) if depression is a factor. Working with a registered dietitian, binge eaters can develop a sensible eating plan that emphasizes healthy foods, along with a program of regular exercise to help them lose weight gradually and keep it off.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Anorexia and Bulimia]\nAnorexia nervosa is a life-threatening eating disorder whose distinguishing features are self-starvation and excessive weight loss. People with anorexia have an irrational fear of gaining weight and a distorted perception of their appearance, believing that they are fat when, in reality, they are extremely thin. They are at a much lower weight than the healthy weight for their height, body type, and level of activity. They consider being thin a unique achievement that gives them some control over at least one part of their lives. Anorexia can cause permanent physical and psychological problems, including the bone-thinning disorder osteoporosis, infertility, heart attack, and depression.\n\nAnorexia most often starts between the ages of 12 and 25 years and affects women and girls more frequently than men and boys.

Psychotic disorders alter a person's thought patterns and reactions to others so severely that he or she undergoes a dramatic change in personality and begins behaving irrationally. These disorders are characterized by the presence of two prominent symptoms: delusions and hallucinations. In most cases, the person does not realize that the hallucinations are not real.\n\nDifferent types of medical conditions—including brain tumors (see page 682), stroke (see page 669), Huntington disease (see page 969), multiple sclerosis (see page 696), epilepsy (see page 686), migraine (see page 684), thyroid disorders (see page 901), and low blood sugar—can cause psychotic symptoms. Sometimes, psychotic symptoms result from drug abuse or exposure to a poison, or are side effects of a prescribed medication.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Schizophrenia]\nSchizophrenia is a disorder of the brain that causes alterations in a person's perceptions (hallucinations) and fixed, false beliefs formed with no proof (delusions). A person with schizophrenia may have disorganized speech, catatonia (abnormal movements and posture or lack of movement), and limited emotional expressiveness. Schizophrenia is responsible for severe disruptions in personal relationships, work or school performance, and self-care. Symptoms usually appear between late adolescence and age 25 for men and between ages 25 and 35 for women. The disorder may be lifelong, but episodes tend to recur at times of emotional stress.\n\nDoctors think that schizophrenia may to some extent be inherited. It also may result from brain damage that occurs during fetal development or in early childhood. An increased risk for schizophrenia has been linked to such factors as malnutrition or exposure to an infection such as influenza before birth, complications of birth, or a brain infection (such as encephalitis; see page 694) or neurological disorder early in life. For unknown reasons, schizophrenia is more common among people who live in the inner city than in people who live in rural areas.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Schizophrenia > *Symptoms*]\nFor most people with schizophrenia, an episode begins with a gradual or, occasionally, sudden withdrawal from daily activities. The content of the person's speech may become increasingly vague, and he or she may seem unable to follow a simple conversation. An acute episode can occur unexpectedly, but often the onset is so gradual that it is difficult to know exactly when psychotic symptoms appear. Initial symptoms may include disconnected remarks accompanied by blank looks. In early phases of schizophrenia, a person may have symptoms that mimic bipolar disorder (see page 715). However, as schizophrenia progresses, the person becomes unusually detached from other people.\n\nPeople who have schizophrenia often believe that others can hear and “steal” their thoughts. They frequently have delusions, ranging from a single idea (such as believing that a family member is an impostor) to complex systems of related beliefs (such as believing that the CIA and FBI have been taken over by extraterrestrials, who are controlling everyone). Sometimes they fear they have lost control of their body movements and thoughts, as if they were puppets. They frequently hear voices, often hostile ones. Less often, they have hallucinations of unusual physical sensations, such as feeling that they have been poisoned or otherwise attacked by someone. They may\n\nexpress exaggerated feelings of happiness, bewilderment, or despair, or inappropriately laugh at sad moments or cry for no reason. Other common symptoms include unpredictable agitation, inappropriate sexual behavior, a neglected appearance, and difficulty performing the activities of daily life.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you suspect that someone in your family has schizophrenia, try to get him or her to see a doctor, although this may not be easy. If your loved one seems to go out of control, try to stay with him or her to prevent self-destructive behavior until help arrives. People who exhibit the symptoms of schizophrenia may be admitted to a hospital for a preliminary period of observation. In the hospital or at the doctor's office, a doctor will perform a physical examination, order relevant tests, and ask you questions about the person's behavior to rule out any physical disorders that might be contributing to the person's behavior. For a diagnosis of schizophrenia to be confirmed, the person must show signs of the disorder for at least 6 months and have at least one display of delusions, hallucinations, or significant abnormalities in thinking.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTreatment of schizophrenia usually involves the use of medications, psychotherapy (see page 7", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Psychotic disorders", "relation": "characterized by", "tail": "delusions and hallucinations"}, {"head": "delusions", "relation": "are a type of", "tail": "hallucinations"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

Doctors diagnose the disorder when a person has had the delusional beliefs for at least 3 months and does not have any psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or other thought abnormalities that would indicate schizophrenia.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIt can be very difficult to bring a person with delusional disorder in for treatment because he or she will vigorously deny any need for help. The best way to persuade an affected person to seek treatment is to suggest that he or she get help for depression or anxiety instead of for the delusion. Hospitalization usually is not necessary—in fact, it may increase the person's distrust and feelings of persecution. Antipsychotic drugs are the primary treatment for delusional disorder and usually are taken indefinitely. Psychotherapy may be helpful, especially with a supportive therapist who can help the person see how his or her delusional beliefs create problems in his or her life. Group therapy is not recommended for people with delusional disorder because other people usually don't share their beliefs. With treatment, some people with delusional disorder recover fully, and others experience episodes of delusions alternating with periods of normalcy. Others remain delusional even with treatment.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Developmental Disorders]\nAttention deficit and other developmental disorders are not as well understood as many other diseases. These disorders are thought to be caused by a combination of factors that can affect the development of the brain—including genes, exposure during fetal development to drugs taken by the mother, abnormal development of the brain, or brain injuries at birth or during early childhood.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Attention Deficit Disorders]\nAttention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are developmental brain disorders characterized by distinctive and consistent behaviors, including inattentiveness, distractibility, impulsiveness, and, in the case of ADHD, hyperactivity (excessive movement or restlessness). The official diagnosis of the condition is ADHD, but three subtypes are medically recognized—predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive, and a combined type. Boys and men more frequently have the hyperactive type of attention deficit disorder; girls and women more often have the inattentive form.\n\nAbout 4 to 6 percent of the US population have an attention deficit disorder. Although the popular conception is that the condition affects only children, an attention deficit disorder can extend into adulthood. One half to two thirds of affected children continue to have problems as adults. The characteristic behaviors usually appear before age 7 and are much stronger than the normal distractibility and impulsiveness that are common in childhood.\n\nAttention deficit is not a new disorder—its characteristic behaviors have been recognized since the early 1900s. In the past, many people with the condition were diagnosed with minimal brain damage. Although the underlying causes of the neurologic problem remain unknown, doctors now think that abnormal brain development or an imbalance in brain chemicals causes an attention deficit disorder. This means that the inattention, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity that are characteristic of an attention deficit disorder have a physical cause in the brain. The common beliefs that ADD and, especially, hyperactivity result from such lifestyle habits as consuming too much sugar or watching too much TV, or from food allergies are not supported by scientific evidence. The disorder seems to run in families, which indicates a genetic component.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Attention Deficit Disorders > *Symptoms*]\nPeople with the inattentive form of ADHD most often have the following symptoms:\n\n- Making careless mistakes and paying little attention to detail\n- Not listening when spoken to directly\n- Failing to follow instructions\n- Trouble finishing tasks\n\n- Being disorganized\n- Absentmindedness and forgetfulness; losing or misplacing things\n- Becoming distracted by noise\n\nPeople with the hyperactive form of ADHD exhibit the following symptoms:\n\n- Fidgeting or squirming\n- Difficulty engaging in quiet activities, such as reading\n- Constant, driven activity\n- Excessive talking\n- Difficulty waiting their turn\n- Making blunt comments or blurt out answers\n- Interrupting\n\nIf you think you or your child has an attention deficit disorder, see a doctor for a thorough evaluation. For effective treatment, it is essential to get an accurate diagnosis, which is not always easy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo make an accurate diagnosis of ADHD, a doctor will try to gather as much information as possible to rule out other possible causes of the problem behavior.

Autism affects 1 in every 500 people in the United States and, for unknown reasons, the incidence is increasing. Boys seem to be affected about four times as often as girls.\n\nLiving with a child who has autism presents daunting challenges to the family. These challenges are further complicated by the fact that children with autism can have multiple mental or emotional disorders—such as impulse-control disorders, psychosis, obsessive-compulsive disorder (see page 720), anxiety disorders (see page 718), or mental retardation—at the same time. Affected children sometimes also have a seizure disorder (see page 686).\n\nMedical researchers are working hard to find the cause of autism. The biological differences in the brain structures of affected people and the fact that autism and related disorders seem to run in families point to a possible genetic influence. No specific gene for the disorder has yet been discovered, but scientists believe that a number of genes may be involved. Other research is examining the possibility of an environmental cause. Doctors do know that autism is not caused by bad parenting or bad choices made by the child about how to behave. There is no scientific evidence to support the theory that autism is linked to a vaccine.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nAlthough children may be affected by the disorder from birth, they often have only subtle symptoms in the first year. Some children with autism seem to develop normally for the first 2 years of their life, acquiring language and other skills at the normal time, only to lose the acquired skill suddenly. Children who have autism usually have an impaired ability to interact socially. They appear indifferent and remote, often avoiding eye contact and not responding to their name. They give the impression that they are completely unaware of how their difficult behavior affects other people, a feature often described by parents as being “walled off.”\n\nAutistic children have trouble interpreting other people's tone of voice and facial expressions, so they cannot respond appropriately to verbal and nonverbal cues. Most children with autism start talking later than usual, and tend to express themselves in a singsong manner. Their conversation is on a limited range of topics, and they seldom interact with their listener. Children with autism often respond abnormally to sounds they hear and to being touched. They sometimes resist being held or cuddled. Changes in routine can be extremely upsetting to them.\n\nIn the most severe cases of autism, children engage in unusual, repetitive behavior, such as rocking or hair twisting. They may injure themselves by biting themselves or banging their heads repeatedly. They can also become extremely aggressive toward other people. Some children with autism have normal intelligence, while others appear to have below-average intelligence, including mental retardation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nAutism is often not diagnosed until after the child's second birthday because parents may not notice any developmental impairment until then. To make a diagnosis of autism, doctors usually rely on interviews with the child and parents, careful observation of the child for the characteristic symptoms of the disorder, and a review of the results of the child's previous physical and neurological examinations. There are no medical tests for diagnosing autism, although doctors may order tests to rule out other disorders. The child may have tests that evaluate his or her brain, such as an electroencephalogram (EEG; see page 687), a CT scan (see page 112), or an MRI (see page 113). Genetic tests are also sometimes done to rule out other disorders.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThere is no cure for autism and no single treatment is effective for all autistic children, but a combination of early intervention programs, special education, family support, and medication can improve the behavior and functioning of affected children and adults. Educational programs for the affected child stress the development of communication and social skills. To help an autistic child reach his or her full potential, parents and siblings are taught behavior training, how to maintain structure in the home, and how to cope with the stresses and challenges of having an autistic child.\n\nDoctors may prescribe some medications for specific symptoms. For example, drugs used to treat anxiety, depression, and psychosis sometimes have a calming effect on a child with autism. Stimulant drugs used to treat hyperactivity may help reduce the frenzied activity sometimes displayed by autistic children.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Addictions and Abuses**]\nSubstance abuse poses a threat to both the user and to society.

But some people should never drink alcohol. Do not drink if you:\n\n- Are pregnant or are trying to become pregnant (alcohol can seriously harm a developing fetus).\n- Plan to drive or use high-speed machinery (alcohol can impair your judgment and slow your reactions).\n- Take certain over-the-counter or prescription drugs such as some antianxiety medications (see page 713), antidepressants (see page 712), or antiseizure drugs, which can interact with alcohol and cause problems.\n- Have health problems (such as liver disease) that could be made worse by drinking. Ask your doctor if you have a condition that could be worsened by drinking.\n- Are a recovering alcoholic (which puts you at risk of a relapse).\n\n- Are under age 21 (because your brain and nervous system are still developing and could be harmed by excessive alcohol intake).\n\nHeavy drinking also increases a woman's risk of the bone-thinning disorder osteoporosis (see page 989) and possibly breast cancer (see page 857). Alcohol's tendency to loosen inhibitions can make you more likely to engage in risky behaviors such as driving while intoxicated or having unprotected sex. Women who drink even small amounts of alcohol during pregnancy risk harming their fetus; fetal alcohol syndrome (see page 409) is the most common preventable cause of mental retardation in the United States.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nPeople who are dependent on or addicted to alcohol have a strong need or compulsion to drink that cannot be overcome by willpower. If they do not have access to alcohol, they experience severe withdrawal symptoms, including nausea, sweating, tremors, and anxiety. They often feel that they are not able to limit or control their drinking once they start. In addition, their tolerance for alcohol increases and they need to drink increasing amounts of alcohol to feel intoxicated.\n\nDenial is a significant psychological trait of people who are dependent on alcohol. They seldom acknowledge that they have a problem. They also may become depressed, jealous, resentful, or paranoid (unreasonably fearing that other people are hostile or plotting against them). Eventually, they can experience loss of memory and concentration, along with an inability to meet the demands of their job. Physically, alcohol dependence can produce a flushed, veiny face; bruises on the body; a husky voice; trembling hands; and chronic gastritis (inflammation of the stomach; see page 781).\n\nPeople who abuse alcohol, on the other hand, do not crave alcohol or have withdrawal symptoms when they stop drinking, but they have problems similar to those of people who are dependent on alcohol. They often develop a pattern of drinking that gets them into trouble at work, with their families, or while driving. They may fail to fulfill responsibilities at work, school, or home. They may drive or operate dangerous machinery while intoxicated and may be arrested for driving or assaulting someone while under the influence of alcohol. Problem drinkers also may have blackouts, periods in which they have no memory of what happened during a drinking episode.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nHow do you know if you are drinking too much? Your answers to the following four questions can help you find out:\n\n- Have you ever felt you should cut down on your drinking?\n- Has anyone ever annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?\n- Do you ever feel bad or guilty about your drinking?\n- Have you ever had a drink the first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover?\n\nOne “yes” answer may indicate that you have a drinking problem. More than one positive response suggests that it is highly likely that you have a problem. If you think that you may have an alcohol abuse or addiction problem, see your doctor right away. He or she will ask you to describe how often and how much you drink and will perform a physical examination to determine the extent to which your drinking has caused any health problems. If necessary, he or she will refer you to an alcohol treatment program.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Q & A > Alcohol and Heart Disease]\n**Q. Is it true that drinking alcohol helps protect against heart disease?**\n\n**A.** Moderate alcohol consumption (two drinks a day for men; one drink a day for women) has been found to lower the risk of heart disease by decreasing the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. This buildup of fat in the arteries is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke (major killers of both men and women). However, in spite of this potentially beneficial effect, you should not start drinking alcohol to prevent heart disease.

An estimated 2 percent of the US population use prescription drugs for nonmedical purposes. The most commonly abused prescription drugs are pain relievers such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, sedatives and tranquilizers such as\n\nbenzodiazepines and diazepam, and stimulants such as methylphenidate. Many of these drugs are highly addictive, and the longer they are taken—especially at high doses—the more damaging their effects and the more prolonged and difficult the withdrawal.\n\nSome groups of people have a substantially higher risk of abusing or becoming addicted to prescription drugs than others. Doctors prescribe drugs for older people three times as frequently as for the general population. An older person can sometimes receive an inappropriately high dose of a prescription medication (because the body's ability to process medications declines with age), or may mistakenly take higher doses of a drug than prescribed. Commonly prescribed sedatives such as benzodiazepines can increase the risk of falls and vehicle accidents in older people and cause physical dependence after about 4 months.\n\nAdolescents are the No. 1 population group to abuse prescription drugs, especially pain relievers, stimulants, barbiturates, and tranquilizers. Recreational use of the drug methylphenidate, prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; see page 730), also is on the rise among adolescents and young adults. Oxycodone, often prescribed as a pain reliever for cancer patients, has become a desirable street drug because it produces a long-lasting high. These drugs are usually either bought from a person for whom they were prescribed or stolen and then sold illegally.\n\nWomen are far more likely to be prescribed a narcotic or addictive antianxiety drug than are men, although men and women have similar rates of recreational prescription drug use. Also, people who work in the health professions may have an increased risk of prescription drug abuse and addiction because they have easy access to the drugs.\n\nIf your doctor gives you a prescription for a drug that can become addictive, ask the doctor if he or she can substitute a medication with a lower potential for dependence. Carefully follow your doctor's instructions to make sure you are taking the correct dose. If you think you may be becoming dependent on a prescription drug, tell your doctor right away so he or she can work with you to gradually stop using the drug and avoid or minimize unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.\n\nEach drug produces its own characteristic mental and physical symptoms (see next page). But addiction to any drug is likely to cause a gradual deterioration of a person's work or school performance and attendance, personal relationships, or both. The behavior of drug abusers or addicts is often erratic and their moods may change rapidly, with periods of restlessness and irritability alternating with extreme drowsiness. They also may have loss of appetite and extreme fatigue.\n\nIf someone close to you displays some of these symptoms, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is dependent on drugs. But if the person also spends more and more time away from home and always seems to be out of money, the likelihood of drug abuse or dependence is high. People who are addicted to a drug need help, but they are unlikely to seek help themselves unless they are desperate. If you are concerned that you or someone you know has a drug problem, talk to your doctor or a professional at a drug counseling center.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA doctor can often diagnose a drug problem by listening to a person's description of his or her drug use and its effects on his or her behavior, relationships, and other aspects of his or her life.

Detoxification is usually done over a period of a week to 10 days in a hospital or treatment center, where your condition can be carefully monitored. At times, a less damaging drug such as methadone is substituted for a more dangerous drug such as heroin. During and possibly after your rehabilitation program, you will participate in group therapy to help you deal with the psychological and social consequences of your past drug use and to show you how to make more positive life choices. To help you stay drug-free over the long term, get involved in an addiction-recovery program such as Narcotics Anonymous.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pathological Gambling]\nLegal gambling has become one of the fastest-growing industries in the United States and is more widely accepted than ever before. The proliferation of casinos and state lotteries has generated a steady rise in problem gambling nationwide. Pathological gambling—irresponsible, uncontrolled betting—sometimes is referred to as a gambling addiction but, although it shares some symptoms with alcoholism and substance abuse (see previous article), doctors categorize it as a disorder of impulse control.\n\nEstimates of the number of pathological gamblers in the United States range from 3 million to 10 million. Up to 8 percent of adolescents may be affected. Most problem gamblers are men, but about one third are women. The problem usually begins in adolescence in males and somewhat later in females. Gambling problems affect people in all segments of society but are more prevalent among the poor and the uneducated, perhaps because they see no other way of achieving the affluence they are exposed to around them and in media images.\n\nProblem gambling seems to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some psychiatrists believe that compulsive gambling is learned behavior that is reinforced by intermittent, random winning, a form of reinforcement known as operant conditioning. This type of conditioning is very difficult to overcome, even when the reward (winning) is removed by losing.\n\nCompulsive gamblers often have other, concurrent mental disorders, including depression (see page 709), panic disorder (see page 719), and substance abuse. Up to 20 percent have attempted suicide. About half of all people who gamble heavily also have an alcohol problem.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe most common characteristics of pathological gambling are:\n\n- A preoccupation with gambling that includes reliving past gambling activities, planning the next bet, or finding ways to obtain money for gambling\n- Needing larger bets and more frequent betting to maintain interest, and not being able to quit while ahead\n- Lying to family members and friends to conceal problem gambling\n- Repeated failed attempts at stopping\n- Intolerance of losing, leading to attempts to win back losses\n- Restlessness, irritability, and physical symptoms when gambling is unavailable\n- Selling personal property or committing illegal acts to finance gambling\n\nMen who have a gambling problem share some personality traits. They are usually highly competitive, energetic, easily bored, easily angered, and seek the approval of others. They also have problems delaying gratification, tend to bend the rules, and rebel against authority. Some pathological gamblers say that they feel secure only when they are gambling, and many construct a dream world in which they fantasize about providing themselves and their friends and family with a luxurious lifestyle as an escape from the difficulties of real life. Women, on the other hand, tend to gamble to escape feelings of depression.\n\nFinancial, marital, employment, and legal problems are common among people who gamble heavily. During the periods between gambling sprees, pathological gamblers often experience nervousness, irritability, insomnia, frustration, and indecision, symptoms resembling those of withdrawal from alcohol or drugs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nYour doctor will ask you about your gambling behavior. If he or she identifies at least four of the characteristics described above, your gambling is likely to be a problem.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe recommended treatment for most pathological gamblers is similar to that of alcohol and drug addiction—group therapy in a structured rehabilitation program such as Gamblers Anonymous. Such programs view the gambling problem as a progressive disease and seek to help the gambler face reality in an atmosphere of fellowship and shared experience.\n\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (see page 710) also has been used with some success to treat pathological gambling by teaching the affected person how to change deeply ingrained patterns of learned behavior and unprod", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "drug", "relation": "treats", "tail": "addiction"}, {"head": "methadone", "relation": "substitutes", "tail": "heroin"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "patient", "relation": "participates in", "tail": "[Event: rehabilitation program]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "participates in", "tail": "[Event: group therapy]"}, {"head": "condition", "relation": "monitored by", "tail": "[Event: hospital or treatment center]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: detoxification]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: rehabilitation program]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Saliva is produced in small glands lining the entire mouth and throat and in three pairs of salivary glands—in the floor of the mouth (the sublingual glands), on each side of the neck below the jaw (the submandibular glands), and above each angle of the jaw (the parotid glands). Your tongue has a complex system of muscles that enables it to move food around as you chew and to mold the food into a ball called a bolus that is small enough to be swallowed. The surface of the tongue is covered with hairlike projections called papillae (known as taste buds). All tongues have creases, but some tongues are more deeply fissured than others. Disorders of the mouth include problems with the lining of the mouth, lips, tongue, and gums.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Mouth and Tongue > The surface of the tongue]\nThe tongue is muscular and flexible and is covered by many projections called papillae (taste buds).\n\n![Diagram of the human mouth showing a canker sore (ulcer) on the palate. The area is labeled 'Papillae'.]()![](_page_1356_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Canker Sores]\nCanker sores (also called aphthous ulcers or recurrent aphthous stomatitis) are common, noncontagious sores that can develop in the lining of the mouth (and sometimes on the tongue and gums), exposing the sensitive tissue underneath. Canker sores tend to occur when stress, fatigue, or illness has weakened the immune system. The sores occur most frequently in adolescents and young adults and in women just before a menstrual period. Sores can also occur in the mouth as a result of injuries from a toothbrush, a poorly fitting denture, or a jagged tooth, or from biting the inside of the cheek.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Canker Sores > *Symptoms*]\nYou may not know you have a canker sore until you eat something spicy or acidic, which makes the sore sting. Most canker sores are small (up to  $\\frac{1}{4}$  inch in diameter), pale yellow spots surrounded by red borders (see page 126). They usually occur singly but may develop in clusters. (Ulcers from an injury are usually large, single sores.) See your doctor about any sore or swelling in your mouth that recurs or that doesn't heal within 2 weeks.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Canker Sores > *Diagnosis*]\nA doctor usually can diagnose canker sores by the symptoms and their appearance. If the sores persist for more than 10 days, he or she may recommend blood tests and a\n\nbiopsy (in which samples of cells are taken from the sore and examined under a microscope). It is important to make sure that the sores are canker sores and not a sign of a more serious disease such as inflammatory bowel disease (see page 764) or cancer.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Canker Sores > *Treatment*]\nCanker sores usually heal without treatment. Over-the-counter medications in the form of gels or lozenges are available that relieve pain and protect the exposed tissue until it heals. Avoid very hot, spicy, or acidic food or drinks. Your doctor may prescribe a mouthwash or ointment containing a corticosteroid, or a short course of oral corticosteroids to reduce inflammation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Canker Sores > **Cold Sores**]\nCold sores are blisters in and around the mouth usually caused by the herpes simplex virus. The initial viral infection often occurs during childhood, with severe symptoms such as swollen gums, extreme fatigue, and fever. After the infection clears up, the virus lies dormant indefinitely. Later, another infection (usually a cold), stress, fatigue, sun exposure, or hormonal changes (such as from menstruation, pregnancy, or menopause) can reactivate the virus. Cold sores are common. The infection is very contagious when blisters are present. Although rare, it is possible to transfer the virus to other parts of your body, such as the genitals (genital herpes, see page 482) or eyes (corneal ulcers, see page 1037).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Canker Sores > *Symptoms*]\nSome people have a slight tingling sensation of the skin around the mouth before they get a cold sore. The gums may become swollen and red. Once the cold sore appears, the blisters burst and develop into painful sores (see page 126). See your doctor about any sore or swelling in your mouth that recurs or that doesn't heal in 2 weeks.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Canker Sores > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nDoctors diagnose cold sores by their appearance. Mild cases of cold sores usually need no treatment. Applying an ice pack to cold sores for a few minutes at a time often relieves pain. Your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medication such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir for you to take by mouth before the blisters are fully formed. These drugs reduce the rate at which the herpes virus multiplies.

In rare cases, symptoms can include small, pale pimples that gradually join to form either a thin, white, lacy network or shiny, red patches of slightly raised tissue (usually on the inside of the cheeks and the sides of the tongue). You may also have a sore mouth and a dry, metallic taste in your mouth. Symptoms can develop suddenly. See your doctor about any sore or swelling in your mouth that recurs or that doesn't heal within 2 weeks.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nDoctors usually can diagnose oral lichen planus by its appearance. The doctor may take a sample of tissue from the affected area for examination under a microscope (biopsy) to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other disorders.\n\nThe treatment of oral lichen planus depends on the cause. The symptoms of the disorder can usually be relieved, but the condition itself cannot be cured. Your doctor may prescribe a topical or oral corticosteroid to reduce inflammation or a pain reliever. If the disorder is caused or worsened by a dental problem such as a jagged tooth or a poorly fitting denture, the doctor will recommend that you see your dentist.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Infections of the Salivary Glands**]\nThe most common cause of a salivary gland infection is the viral infection mumps (see page 440), but a salivary gland infection can also be caused by bacteria. A persistent salivary gland infection can cause extensive scarring in the affected gland and prevent the gland from producing saliva.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nSymptoms of a salivary gland infection include swelling and pain on each side of the neck below the jaw, or above the angle of the jaw. You may have a bad taste in your mouth from pus discharged by the infected gland. Eating spicy foods or citrus fruits increases the flow of saliva, which can cause swelling if the gland is completely or partially blocked. See your doctor about any swelling in your mouth that recurs or that doesn't heal within 2 weeks.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **The salivary glands**]\nThe mouth contains three pairs of salivary glands: the parotid glands, the submandibular glands, and the sublingual glands. All of the salivary glands secrete saliva, which contains a digestive enzyme that helps break down carbohydrates. Saliva also keeps the mouth moist and lubricates food for swallowing. The parotid glands, the largest salivary glands, are just below and in front of the ears. The sublingual glands lie just beneath the tongue toward the front of the mouth. The submandibular glands lie deeper than the sublingual glands at the back of the mouth and can be felt beneath the jaw.\n\n![Diagram showing the three pairs of salivary glands in the mouth: Sublingual glands, Submandibular glands, and Parotid glands.]()![](_page_1361_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have symptoms of a salivary gland infection, your doctor will look for swelling, tenderness, and redness in the glands and pus flowing from your salivary ducts. (He or she will massage the glands to see if pus comes out.) If the infection has persisted for a long time, your doctor may recommend a CT scan (see page 112) or order a sialogram, an X-ray of the salivary gland taken after injection of a contrast medium (dye). A sialogram will show the areas of obstruction on X-ray film.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nUnless the gland is completely blocked, the doctor will probably use lemon juice to stimulate the flow of saliva in the infected gland to flush out the bacteria. He or she will prescribe an antibiotic to treat the infection and may use probes to try to widen the ducts of the salivary gland to increase the flow of saliva and prevent further infection. If the salivary gland has been irreversibly damaged, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Stones in the Salivary Ducts or Glands**]\nSalivary duct stones are tiny particles that form when chemicals and salts in saliva collect around a tiny amount of solid material or mucus in the duct of a salivary gland. Stones inside the salivary gland itself are more rare. The stone blocks the duct, preventing saliva from getting through and causing the gland to swell. A persistently obstructed salivary gland duct can cause extensive scarring that reduces the gland's ability to produce saliva. The submandibular glands (on each side of the neck below the jaw) are the most susceptible to blockage. Salivary duct stones most frequently affect middle-aged or older people.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nThe main symptoms of a stone in the salivary duct are pain and swelling on each side of the neck below the jaw, above the angle of each jaw, or under the chin, particularly while eating.\n\nTo check for a stone in a salivary duct or gland, your doctor may recommend X-rays.

Geographic tongue is a specific inflammatory disorder of the tongue in which the papillae (tiny hairlike projections known as taste buds) are deformed and cover only part of the tongue.

The cause of geographic tongue is unknown.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Glossitis and Geographic Tongue > *Symptoms*]\nIn both glossitis and geographic tongue, the tongue is dark red, smooth (a healthy tongue is pink and bumpy) and sore (especially after eating spicy food).

Geographic tongue usually affects smaller areas of the tongue than glossitis, and the symptoms come and go.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Glossitis and Geographic Tongue > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA doctor can diagnose geographic tongue by its appearance, but there is no known treatment for the condition. Treating the underlying cause of glossitis, such as an infection or vitamin deficiency, may clear it up. To help relieve soreness, avoid eating hot or spicy food, drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, or chewing tobacco.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Glossitis and Geographic Tongue > **Geographic tongue**]\nIn geographic tongue, patches of the surface cells that coat the tongue break down, producing a maplike pattern.\n\n![Illustration of the human mouth showing the tongue with a map-like pattern, characteristic of geographic tongue.]()![](_page_1366_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Esophagus]\nThe esophagus is the muscular tube, about 10 inches long, that runs from the back of your throat to your stomach. As you swallow food, the back of your tongue pushes it into the esophagus, the soft palate closes off the passage to the nose, and the flap of tissue (the epiglottis) at the top of the windpipe shuts to prevent food from entering the windpipe and lungs. Contractions of the esophageal muscles move the food down to the base of the esophagus. Muscles at the entrance to the stomach relax to let the food pass through. The lower esophageal sphincter muscle then tightens to prevent food, stomach acid, and digestive enzymes from going back up into the esophagus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pharyngeal Pouch]\nA pharyngeal pouch, also called an esophageal diverticulum, is a rare disorder in which a bulge or sac develops at the back of the throat (pharynx). It usually develops when the upper esophageal sphincter muscle fails to relax. The bundles of muscles spread apart and the muscle lining pushes through, creating an area where food settles during swallowing. As it fills with food, this area stretches and forms a baglike pouch. For unknown reasons, pharyngeal pouches occur most often in middle-aged men. In some\n\ncases, a person can inhale fluid and undigested food that has settled in the pouch (especially while sleeping), leading to pneumonia (see page 660).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pharyngeal Pouch > **Pharyngeal pouch**]\nA pharyngeal pouch is an abnormal sac that bulges down from the back of the throat.\n\n![Diagram showing a sagittal view of the human head and neck, illustrating the Pharyngeal pouch, Esophagus, and Throat (pharynx).]()![](_page_1367_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pharyngeal Pouch > **Symptoms**]\nThe symptoms of a pharyngeal pouch include difficulty swallowing and a feeling of swelling in the throat. A person may also cough and have bad breath and a metallic taste in the mouth from regurgitated liquid or undigested food. Some people lose weight because very little food gets into the stomach.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pharyngeal Pouch > **Diagnosis**]\nYour doctor may be able to diagnose a pharyngeal pouch from your symptoms and a physical examination. He or she may recommend a barium X-ray (see page 767) of your throat and esophagus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pharyngeal Pouch > **Treatment**]\nSome people who have a pharyngeal pouch learn how to empty the pouch into their esophagus by manipulating it with their fingers, by getting into specific positions, or by\n\ncoughing. If the pouch continues to expand or if you lose weight, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the pouch.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Indigestion]\nIndigestion (often called heartburn) is a term used to describe discomfort in the upper abdomen. Some people get indigestion after consuming caffeine or high-fat or acidic foods. Drinking carbonated beverages or wine, beer, or liquor can cause indigestion in some people. Eating too fast or having an exceptionally large meal can also cause indigestion. Some people get indigestion when they are depressed, anxious, or nervous. Pregnant women, heavy smokers, and people who are overweight seem to be most susceptible.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nSymptoms of indigestion include a dull, burning, gnawing, ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Glossitis", "relation": "can result from", "tail": "an infection"}, {"head": "Glossitis", "relation": "can result from", "tail": "a vitamin deficiency"}, {"head": "Glossitis", "relation": "can result from", "tail": "an allergic reaction"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

The discomfort occurs regularly when your stomach is full or when you change position (such as when you bend over or lie flat). Other symptoms of GERD include belching and an acidic taste in your mouth. Some people may have difficulty swallowing.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose GERD, your doctor will probably perform a procedure called endoscopy (see page 766) to examine your esophagus. He or she may also recommend manometry (see next page) to measure changes in pressure in the esophagus that occur during swallowing, and tests to measure the amount of acid in the stomach over 24 hours.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > **Hiatal hernia**]\nNormally the stomach lies below the diaphragm, the sheet of muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen (right). A hiatal hernia (far right) occurs when part of the stomach protrudes up into the chest through an opening (hiatus) in the diaphragm.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the human digestive system. The left side shows a 'Healthy diaphragm and stomach'. The right side shows a 'Hiatal hernia', where the stomach is pushed through the diaphragm into the chest cavity, labeled as 'Hiatal hernia'.]()![](_page_1372_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > **Treatment**]\nThe treatment of GERD depends on the symptoms. Your doctor may recommend an over-the-counter antacid or prescribe one to neutralize the stomach acid or reduce the amount of acid in your stomach. He or she may also prescribe a medication that increases the speed at which food passes through the stomach and into the intestines. If a hiatal hernia is causing GERD, your doctor may recommend surgery to repair the hernia. Untreated GERD can lead to a rare condition called Barrett's esophagus (a change in the lining of the lower esophagus), which increases the risk of cancer of the esophagus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > **Manometry**]\nManometry is a measurement of pressure. Esophageal manometry measures contractions of the muscular wall of the esophagus to evaluate the functioning of the esophagus. The contractions of the esophagus propel food to the stomach during digestion. In esophageal manometry, a thin, flexible tube that contains pressure sensors is inserted into the nose or mouth, and down the throat into the esophagus. Pressure measurements of the esophagus and of the\n\nupper and lower esophageal sphincters are taken while the person swallows water.\n\nAnorectal manometry is used to measure contractions of the rectum and the anal sphincter. In this procedure, a  $\\frac{1}{4}$ -inch flexible tube is inserted 3 to 4 inches into the rectum. Pressure measurements are taken while the rectum and anus are stimulated in various ways such as by moving the tube around in the rectum, inflating a balloon attached to the tube with air or water, or withdrawing the tube.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Preventing Acid Reflux]\nIn addition to the steps recommended on the previous page to prevent indigestion, the following measures can help control GERD or prevent acid reflux:\n\n- Lose weight if you are overweight, which can help reduce abdominal pressure.\n- Eat small meals several times a day. When less food is in the stomach, less acid is produced.\n- Don't eat late at night or up to 2 hours before going to bed. The stomach produces more acid at night.\n- Avoid caffeine and tobacco, which relax the muscle at the bottom of the esophagus.\n- In bed, keep your head, neck, and shoulders propped up at a  $30^\\circ$  angle. Gravity helps acid flow down and out of the esophagus.\n- Don't wear constricting clothing or belts. They can increase pressure inside the abdomen.\n- Avoid positions such as lying down or activities such as jogging (especially right after a meal), which can cause acid reflux.\n\nIn severe cases, a doctor may recommend a surgical procedure called fundoplication. During this procedure, a section of the upper part of the stomach is pulled up and wrapped around the lower part of the esophagus to make it tighter, limiting the amount of acid that can flow back up into the esophagus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Esophageal Stricture]\nStricture (narrowing) of the esophagus is a common disorder that usually results from an accumulation of scar tissue in the esophagus. A stricture may be both the result and the cause of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD; see page 750). Even after treatment, an esophageal stricture caused by GERD can recur.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Esophageal Stricture > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nUsually the only symptom of an esophageal stricture is difficulty swallowing. To diagnose a stricture of the esophagus, a doctor will order a barium X-ray (see page 767).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Esophageal Stricture > *Treatment*]\nTo treat an esophageal stricture, your doctor will proba", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "GERD", "relation": "include", "tail": "belching"}, {"head": "GERD", "relation": "include", "tail": "acidic taste in your mouth"}, {"head": "GERD", "relation": "cause", "tail": "difficulty swallowing"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "perform", "tail": "[Event: endoscopy]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "recommend", "tail": "[Event: manometry]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

The increased pressure in the portal vein usually is caused by scarring of the liver from cirrhosis (see page 790). People who have liver damage from uncontrolled hereditary hemochromatosis (see page 961) or a disease such as Wilson's disease (see page 792) are also at increased risk of developing esophageal varices. The veins can widen to the point of rupture, causing bleeding into the esophagus or stomach, which can be fatal.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nSymptoms of bleeding from esophageal varices include vomiting blood and passing dark-colored or black stool. The stool is dark from partially digested blood. Some people who have esophageal varices may have other symptoms of liver disease, such as jaundice (yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes; see page 785). Bleeding can cause a sudden drop in blood pressure, which can lead to shock.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nTo diagnose esophageal varices, a doctor will perform a procedure called endoscopy (see page 766) to examine the veins at the lower end of the esophagus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Esophageal varices]\nEsophageal varices are bulging veins in the walls of the lower part of the esophagus that occur as a result of increased blood pressure in the portal vein, which carries blood from the stomach and intestines to the liver. The condition, which results from liver damage, can be life-threatening if the veins burst and bleed.\n\n![Diagram of the human torso showing the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and the location of swollen veins in the lower esophagus.]()![](_page_1377_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nIf you have esophageal varices, your doctor will prescribe a blood pressure medication such as a beta blocker to lower the pressure in the portal vein. If the varices rupture, you will immediately be admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital and given a synthetic hormone called octreotide intravenously (through a vein). The hormone decreases pressure in the portal vein and helps reduce the bleeding.\n\nTo evaluate the problem, a doctor will pass an endoscope (viewing tube) through your esophagus to the varices. To stop the bleeding, he or she will then either inject a chemical agent through the endoscope into the ruptured vein to cause it to scar or place a rubber band around the vein to seal it off.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > Esophageal Varices]\nBleeding from esophageal varices can be life-threatening. Call 911 or your local emergency number or go to the nearest hospital emergency department immediately if you have the following symptoms:\n\n- Vomiting or spitting up bright red or dark blood\n- Unusually pale skin\n- Dark stool\n\nWear a medical identification bracelet with the words “esophageal varices” on it (and that states your blood type) so that emergency personnel can treat you promptly and effectively in an emergency.\n\nIf the bleeding cannot be stopped with these measures, the doctor may try inserting an endoscope into the esophagus and passing a deflated balloon through the endoscope to the site of the varices. The balloon is then inflated, putting pressure on the veins in the esophagus and stopping the bleeding. Often, a procedure called transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) is performed to reroute the portal vein to connect directly to the hepatic vein (which drains blood from the liver), relieving some of the pressure inside the esophagus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Cancer of the Esophagus]\nCancer of the esophagus is rare. But when cancer develops in the lining of the esophagus, the cancer cells multiply rapidly and are likely to spread to other parts of the body. The tumor eventually blocks the passageway to the stomach. Esophageal cancer can be divided into two main types—squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma develops in the cells that line the esophagus. Because the entire esophagus is lined with squamous cells, squamous cell carcinoma can occur anywhere in the esophagus. Squamous cell carcinoma used to be responsible for 90 percent of all esophageal cancers but now makes up only 50 percent.\n\nAdenocarcinomas usually develop in glandular tissue in the lining of the lower part of the esophagus. Adenocarcinoma can result from tissue changes in the esophagus caused by chronic inflammation from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD; see page 750).\n\nCancer of the esophagus has been linked to long-term exposure to irritants such as tobacco smoke and alcohol. A person's risk of cancer of the esophagus increases even more when he or she both smokes and drinks. The cancer is more common in men than\n\nin women and usually develops after age 60.

The pain is often worse about 2 hours after a meal and at night and can usually be relieved by eating something or taking an antacid. Other possible symptoms include nausea, vomiting (the vomit may be tinged with blood), and black, tarry stool (from bleeding). A rare condition called pyloric stenosis can result if scarring from a peptic ulcer blocks the pylorus (the outlet from the stomach to the duodenum), preventing the stomach from emptying normally and sometimes causing projectile vomiting (forceful vomiting immediately after eating).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > **Duodenal ulcer**]\nA duodenal ulcer is a sore in the wall of the first part of the small intestine (the duodenum) caused by erosion of the lining of the duodenum.\n\n![Diagram illustrating a duodenal ulcer.

Your doctor may order tests to look for blood in the stool, or blood tests to check for H. pylori or an iron deficiency (anemia; see page 610). Anemia can be a sign of internal bleeding.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nReducing the amount of acid in the stomach is the usual treatment for peptic ulcers. Your doctor may recommend an over-the-counter antacid or may prescribe one. He or she may also prescribe a medication that coats the ulcer to protect it from stomach acid and allow it to heal. If your doctor detects H. pylori in the biopsy, he or she will prescribe antibiotics. Don't take over-the-counter antacids unless your doctor has diagnosed a peptic ulcer and has recommended them. Taking antacids can mask symptoms of more serious disorders such as stomach cancer. Stop smoking, because smoking can irritate the stomach lining and slow healing.\n\nIn rare cases, surgery is necessary to treat a peptic ulcer. A surgeon may close a severely bleeding perforated duodenal ulcer with stitches. In a procedure called vagotomy, the surgeon may cut the nerves responsible for controlling the production of stomach acid. Usually the stomach outlet is widened (in a procedure called pyloroplasty) at the same time to prevent tightening of the pyloric muscles that would normally follow vagotomy. For duodenal ulcers, a surgical procedure called gastrojejunostomy (see next page) is sometimes performed to create an opening from the stomach to the middle section of the small intestine (jejunum) and close the opening into the duodenum.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > **Helicobacter pylori in stomach lining**]\nHelicobacter pylori is a spiral-shaped bacterium that attaches itself to the surface of mucus-secreting cells of the stomach lining. About 50 percent of people over age 60 are infected with H. pylori, and most of them have no symptoms. But about 15 to 20 percent of people who have the bacterium develop a peptic ulcer.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the human digestive system, showing the Esophagus, Stomach, Duodenum, and Stomach lining.

However, sometimes a disorder can affect more than one digestive organ in the abdomen (such as the stomach and the intestines). This section discusses the disorders that affect multiple organs, including the stomach, the small intestine, the large intestine, and the peritoneum (the membrane that lines the entire abdominal cavity and encloses many organs). These disorders often involve signs and symptoms such as inflammation, blockage, and paralysis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > General Abdominal Disorders > The stomach, small intestine, and large intestine]\nSometimes a disorder of the digestive system can affect more than one organ, such as the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine.\n\n![Diagram of the human digestive system showing the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine.]()![](_page_1387_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Peritonitis]\nPeritonitis is inflammation of the peritoneum, the two-layered membrane that lines the abdominal cavity and covers the stomach, intestines, and other abdominal organs. Peritonitis almost always results from an underlying untreated inflammatory disorder. For example, it may occur as a complication of a disorder of the digestive tract such as a peptic ulcer (see page 755), diverticulitis (see page 772), appendicitis (see page 771), or Crohn's disease (see page 764). In women, peritonitis can be a complication of some disorders of the fallopian tubes such as a ruptured ectopic pregnancy (see page 523). Peritonitis also can be caused by an infection that results from an injury that pierces the abdominal wall.\n\nFull recovery from peritonitis is possible if treatment is started promptly. If untreated, peritonitis can lead to severe dehydration or a chemical imbalance (from repeated vomiting), paralysis of the intestines (ileus; see page 761), or shock (see page 579). Although peritonitis can be fatal, few people die of it because antibiotics can usually clear up the infection.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nThe main symptom of peritonitis is severe pain in the abdomen. The pain is most severe near the site of the initial disorder and increases when you move. For example, the pain from a ruptured peptic ulcer is worse in the upper midright side of the abdomen. A person usually has a fever. Other symptoms depend on the source of the inflammation or infection and can include nausea and vomiting. After a few hours the stomach becomes bloated and the pain more generalized.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have symptoms of peritonitis, go to the nearest hospital emergency department immediately. The doctor will ask you about your symptoms and feel your abdomen to find the most painful area and identify the source of the inflammation. He or she will also order blood tests and a CT scan (see page 112). If fluid is present in the abdominal cavity, the doctor may perform a procedure called paracentesis, in which he or she inserts a needle into the cavity and withdraws a sample of fluid for evaluation. If the doctor is unsure of the diagnosis, he or she may recommend a surgical procedure called exploratory laparotomy, in which the abdominal cavity is opened to look for the cause of the disorder.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Paracentesis**]\nIn abdominal paracentesis, a doctor uses a needle and syringe to draw fluid out of the abdominal cavity for analysis in a laboratory.\n\n![Diagram illustrating abdominal paracentesis.

For example, a surgeon may remove a damaged segment of intestine or repair a perforated ulcer. Before surgery you will be given antibiotics intravenously (through a\n\nvein) to treat the infection, and fluids if you are dehydrated. The surgeon will place soft rubber tubes in your abdominal cavity to drain the accumulated fluid.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Intestinal Obstruction**]\nAn intestinal obstruction is a partial or complete blockage of the intestines. The most common cause of an obstruction is a band of scar tissue (adhesion) that develops as a result of abdominal surgery. The band of scar tissue can wrap around the intestine, or the intestine can wrap around the scar tissue, squeezing the intestine. An intestinal blockage can also result from inflammation from an inflammatory bowel disease (see page 764), a cancerous tumor in the colon (see page 775), a strangulated hernia (see page 762), or an indigestible mass such as hardened bulk laxative.

The paralysis is caused by abnormal electrical activity of the intestinal muscles. The contractions that move food through the intestines slow down or stop entirely, causing gas, fluid, and stool to collect in the intestines. Ileus is usually the result of abdominal surgery, severe infections, or some medications. It can also result from digestive disorders such as an intestinal obstruction (see page 759), peritonitis (see page 759), pancreatitis (see page 799), or a perforated peptic ulcer (see page 755). People with some nervous system disorders such as multiple sclerosis (see page 696) or Parkinson's disease (see page 691) are at increased risk. Ileus can be fatal if the underlying disorder is not treated.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of ileus include pain and swelling in the abdomen, constipation, failure to pass gas, and vomiting. If you have these symptoms, see your doctor to determine the underlying cause. If you have these symptoms along with a fever, you could have a life-threatening infection that requires emergency medical attention.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > **WARNING!** > **Ileus**]\nParalysis of the intestine can be life-threatening if it causes an infection. If you have a fever with any of the following symptoms, call 911 or your local emergency number or go to the nearest hospital emergency department immediately:\n\n- Abdominal pain and swelling\n- Constipation\n- Inability to pass gas\n- Vomiting\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have symptoms of ileus, the doctor will examine you and will order an X-ray of your abdomen. To rule out other disorders, he or she will take a detailed health history and order blood tests to check the level of calcium and electrolytes (such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium) and evaluate the functioning of your thyroid gland. Abnormalities in any of these can slow the electrical activity of the intestines.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf you have symptoms of ileus, a doctor will pass a long tube down your nose or mouth into your stomach and intestines to remove fluid and air, which relieves pain by relieving the pressure the blocked intestine is putting on adjacent tissues and organs. Further treatment of ileus depends on the cause. Because some degree of intestinal\n\nparalysis is common after abdominal surgery, doctors try to avoid or minimize the use of narcotics for pain relief because the drugs can slow the movement of the intestines.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Carcinoid Tumors**]\nCarcinoid tumors are cancerous tumors that are most often found in the appendix but can also develop in the wall of the intestines or stomach. Although they are cancerous tumors, they develop so slowly that 50 percent of people who have them never have symptoms and the tumors are found during tests or surgery for another disorder. However, if the carcinoid tumor grows large enough, it can cause symptoms of an intestinal obstruction (see page 759). In 10 percent of cases, cells from the tumor spread through the bloodstream to the liver, where the cells multiply and form hormone-producing tumors. The hormones released by these tumors produce symptoms that are collectively called carcinoid syndrome.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Carcinoid Tumors** > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptom in carcinoid syndrome is flushing of the head and neck that lasts several hours and is usually triggered by exercise or drinking alcohol. If the cancer spreads to the liver, signs can include abdominal cramping, sudden episodes of watery diarrhea, symptoms of asthma (see page 640) such as wheezing, and symptoms of heart failure (see page 570) such as breathlessness.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Carcinoid Tumors** > *Diagnosis*]\nCarcinoid tumors can be difficult to diagnose. If you have symptoms of carcinoid syndrome, your doctor may order blood and urine tests to identify the hormone that the carcinoid tumor is secreting. He or she may also recommend a CT scan (see page 134), colonoscopy (see page 767), or endoscopy (see page 766) to examine your stomach and intestines. You may also have capsule video endoscopy (see page 767), in which you swallow a small pill containing a camera that takes a video of your small intestine.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Carcinoid Tumors** > *Treatment*]\nSurgery is the usual treatment for carcinoid tumors. However, all the tumors must be removed to eliminate the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome, which can be difficult.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are examples of inflammatory bowel disease. Crohn's disease can occur in any part of the digestive tract but usually occurs in the intestines. Ulcerative colitis usually affects the large intestine and the rectum (but sometimes just the rectum). The cause of inflammatory bowel disease is unknown, but doctors think the inflammation may be an immune system response to a viral or bacterial infection. Neither disorder results from stress or from eating specific foods, although these factors can trigger symptoms in some people who have the disorder.\n\nInflammatory bowel disease tends to run in families and affects men and women in equal numbers. The inflammation may produce ulcers in the intestine and colon and scar tissue that thickens and narrows the intestinal wall, possibly causing an intestinal obstruction (see page 759). In ulcerative colitis, sores form where inflammation has killed cells in the intestinal lining. About 20 percent of people who have Crohn's disease develop anal fistulas (abnormal channels from the intestine to the surface of the skin or other organs; see page 779). Fistulas can leak to the skin or other organs and cause peritonitis (see page 759). People who have inflammatory bowel disease, especially ulcerative colitis, have an increased risk of developing cancer of the intestine (see page 775).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Inflammatory Bowel Disease > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease can include diarrhea (that may contain blood or pus), abdominal pain, fatigue, fever, and, in children, failure to grow. In ulcerative colitis, or Crohn's disease that involves the colon, the stool may be especially bloody because of bleeding ulcers in the intestine. If inflammatory bowel disease persists for years, it can cause a gradual deterioration in bowel function. If you have fistulas that prevent digested food from being absorbed, you may lose weight. If a fistula connects to your skin, the contents of your intestines may leak out of your body. Inflammatory bowel disease can also cause symptoms such as red eyes, rashes, joint pain, or liver abnormalities in areas of the body other than the intestines.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Inflammatory Bowel Disease > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease, your doctor will perform a physical examination. He or she may perform a procedure called colonoscopy (see page 767) to examine your colon. If just the lower third of the colon is examined, the procedure is called sigmoidoscopy (see page 144). He or she may also order a barium X-ray (see page 767) of your intestines. You may also have capsule video endoscopy (see page 767), in which you swallow a small pill containing a camera that takes a video of your small intestine. Your doctor may also order blood tests and tests to look for blood, bacteria, or viruses in your stool to rule out cancer or a viral or bacterial infection. He or she will probably take samples of cells from your intestine for examination under a microscope (biopsy) to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTo treat Crohn's disease, a doctor may prescribe anti-inflammatory medications such as sulfasalazine or mesalamine, corticosteroids such as prednisone or budesonide, or drugs such as azathioprine or methotrexate that suppress the body's abnormal immune response. He or she may prescribe the corticosteroids in large doses for an initial, severe attack and then in gradually decreasing doses to prevent a recurrence. If Crohn's disease affects the colon, a doctor will also prescribe antibiotics such as metronidazole or ciprofloxacin.\n\nFor ulcerative colitis, the usual treatment is mesalamine taken both by mouth and by enemas or rectal suppositories. In some cases, corticosteroids or more powerful immune-suppressing drugs may be necessary.\n\nSurgical removal of part of the colon in a procedure called partial or total colectomy (see page 776) is sometimes necessary to treat Crohn's disease that does not respond to medication or to treat complications such as fistulas or scarring. A total colectomy may be done for ulcerative colitis that has not responded to other treatments.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Irritable Bowel Syndrome**]\nIrritable bowel syndrome (also called spastic or irritable colon) is a common disorder that can cause a number of symptoms in any organ in the gastrointestinal tract, including the esophagus, stomach, and small and large intestines. The cause of the disorder is unknown, but it may result from a dysfunction of the involuntary nerves or muscles in these organs. In irritable bowel syndrome, the waves of muscular contractions that normally move stool through the intestines become uncoordinated.

As the colonoscope is slowly withdrawn, the doctor examines the lining of the colon for abnormalities such as inflammation, polyps, or tumors. A tiny camera at the end of the colonoscope displays images of the inside of the colon on a video monitor. The procedure is painless but can be uncomfortable, so a person is given a sedative to relax him or her and to reduce any discomfort. Growths such as polyps can be shaved and removed through the endoscope. Bleeding blood vessels or ulcers can also be treated through the endoscope.\n\n![Diagram illustrating a procedure for capsule video endoscopy.

The so-called edible camera travels through the intestinal tract by way of peristalsis, the natural contractions of the intestines. Along the way, the camera captures video images of the inside of the intestinal tract and transmits the images to sensors on a belt worn around the person's abdomen. The sensors store the images on a recorder. The process takes about 8 hours. The person then returns the belt and recorder to the doctor's office, where the doctor can download the images and view them on a computer screen to check for any abnormalities in the intestinal tract. The disposable (flushable) camera passes out of the body naturally during bowel movement, usually within 24 hours.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Colonoscopy > Barium X-Ray Examinations]\nTests using a contrast medium (dye) called barium a", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "doctors", "relation": "use", "tail": "endoscopes"}, {"head": "endoscopes", "relation": "contain", "tail": "cameras"}, {"head": "endoscopes", "relation": "contain", "tail": "instruments"}, {"head": "endoscopes", "relation": "contain", "tail": "lights"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctors", "relation": "examine", "tail": "[Event: a body cavity]"}, {"head": "doctors", "relation": "perform", "tail": "[Event: medical procedures]"}, {"head": "patients", "relation": "participate in", "tail": "[Event: endoscopic procedure]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment]"}]}, "status": "success"}

He or she will try to rule out cancer or a viral or bacterial infection by testing stool samples for blood, viruses, or bacteria. A diagnosis of celiac disease can be confirmed with a biopsy (in which samples of cells are taken from the intestine and examined under a microscope) to check for damage to the villi.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe usual treatment for celiac disease is to eliminate all gluten-containing foods from the diet. Your doctor will advise you to avoid baked goods, cereals, pasta, and any other foods (or drinks such as beer, ale, vodka, gin, or whiskey) that contain wheat, barley, rye, or oats. Although oats may not cause symptoms in all people who have celiac disease, they should be avoided because gluten in oats can damage the villi without causing symptoms. Gluten can also be found in medications, mouthwashes, and some additives, preservatives, and stabilizers. Within a few days of following a gluten-free diet, most symptoms improve and the intestinal lining starts to heal. In rare cases, some people with celiac disease don't respond to a gluten-free diet and may need to take corticosteroids or other medications to reduce inflammation. Some people have to be fed intravenously (through a vein) to get adequate nutrition.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Tumors of the Small Intestine**]\nLike tumors elsewhere in the body, tumors of the small intestine can be malignant (cancerous) or benign (noncancerous). Most are benign (only 1 of 10 cases is malignant). Tumors of the small intestine may cause no symptoms and are often diagnosed by tests performed for another reason. In rare cases, they may be carcinoid tumors (see page 761).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nTumors in the small intestine can cause symptoms of anemia (see page 610) such as paleness, fatigue, or palpitations (heartbeats that you are aware of). You may have traces of blood in your stool or very dark, bloody stool. If a tumor is very large, it may cause abdominal pain and an intestinal obstruction (see page 759). If the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it may cause symptoms such as weight loss or fatigue.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nIf you have symptoms of an intestinal tumor, your doctor will perform a barium X-ray (see page 767) of your intestines or capsule video endoscopy (see page 767). Surgery is the usual treatment for both cancerous and noncancerous tumors of the small intestine. Radiation therapy (see page 23) and chemotherapy (see page 23) may be used alone or in combination to destroy cancer cells.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Constipation and Diarrhea]\nConstipation is generally defined as having hard, dry, difficult-to-pass stools and infrequent bowel movements. Usually constipation is the result of not drinking enough water, not eating enough fiber-containing food, lack of exercise, stress, or delaying bowel movements. Some medications (such as cough suppressants and antianxiety medications) can cause constipation. Overusing laxatives can lead to constipation by overemptying the bowel and making a person dependent on them to have a bowel movement. (Also, the effect of laxatives diminishes when used repeatedly.) A number of conditions, such as hypothyroidism (see page 903) or a high level of calcium in the blood, can cause constipation. If constipation persists for more than 2 weeks, see your doctor.\n\nDiarrhea is usually considered to be an abnormal increase in the looseness and amount of stool and very frequent bowel movements. In general, the more frequent the bowel movements, the looser the stool. Sometimes diarrhea can be brought on by stress or as a side effect of some medications (such as antacids or antibiotics), but it is usually the result of a viral or bacterial infection or food poisoning. Some foods (such as some fruits and dairy products) can cause diarrhea. If diarrhea persists for more than 3 days or if you see blood in your stool, see your doctor. Also call your doctor if you have diarrhea and your stool is bloody or contains pus or if you are extremely thirsty or weak, have a fever, or have pain in your abdomen.\n\nPeople differ markedly in the pattern and consistency of their bowel movements. See your doctor about any change in your normal pattern; you could have a serious disorder.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Lactose Intolerance]\nLactose intolerance results from the body's inability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. In lactose intolerance, the body produces little or no lactase, an enzyme in the small intestine needed to break down lactose. Lactose intolerance can cause gastrointestinal disturbances such as bloating, cramping, and diarrhea.\n\nMany of the world's people—especially those of A", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "celiac disease", "relation": "can be confirmed by", "tail": "biopsy"}, {"head": "gluten-containing foods", "relation": "should be avoided", "tail": "diet"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "will perform", "tail": "[Event: physical examination]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "may order", "tail": "[Event: blood tests]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "will try to rule out", "tail": "[Event: cancer or viral or bacterial infection]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "will advise", "tail": "[Event: eliminate gluten-containing foods from diet]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: testing stool samples for blood, viruses, or bacteria]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: diagnosis of celiac disease]"}, {"head": "[Event: physical examination]", "relation": "is part of", "tail": "[Event: diagnosis of celiac disease]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Usually the pain begins around the navel and then moves to a small area in the lower right abdomen. Slight pressure on the area will increase the pain. Other symptoms can include fever, nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Some people notice that they have not had a bowel movement for a day or two before the attack, while others have bouts of diarrhea. Do not take a laxative if you have symptoms of appendicitis; it can cause an inflamed appendix to rupture.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosis]\nAppendicitis is sometimes difficult to diagnose because other disorders have similar symptoms. If you have symptoms of appendicitis, your doctor will perform a physical examination and press on your abdomen to locate the site of the pain. If your doctor thinks you have appendicitis, he or she will admit you to a hospital and order a number of tests, such as blood tests, a CT scan (see page 112), and ultrasound (see page 111), to rule out other disorders. If a diagnosis of appendicitis is uncertain, your doctor will recommend a surgical procedure called exploratory laparotomy in which the abdominal cavity is opened to look for the cause of the disorder.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Appendix]\nThe appendix projects from the cecum (the first part of the large intestine) in the lower right side of the abdomen, where the small intestine and the large intestine meet. The appendix is part of the immune system.\n\n![Diagram of the human abdomen showing the location of the appendix relative to the large intestine, small intestine, and cecum.]()![](_page_1411_Picture_6.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTo treat appendicitis, doctors remove the appendix immediately in a surgical procedure called appendectomy. If ultrasound shows that the appendix is severely abscessed (filled with pus), the appendectomy may be delayed for a few days or weeks until the infection has cleared up with antibiotics and the abscess drained with surgery or by inserting a tube. Because appendicitis is likely to flare up again, the appendix is removed as soon as tests show that the infection has cleared up. Even if the appendix looks normal, the surgeon still removes it because, if the appendix were not removed and the person later develops appendicitis and comes into an emergency department, doctors would recognize the characteristic appendectomy scar and would incorrectly rule out appendicitis as the cause.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Appendectomy**]\nA surgeon can remove an inflamed appendix in a procedure called appendectomy. While the person is under a general anesthetic, the surgeon makes a diagonal incision in the lower right side of the abdomen. He or she clamps the appendix at its base, cuts it off, and sews up the remaining stump.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the site of appendectomy incision. A line points to the lower right side of the abdomen, indicating the location where the incision is made for the procedure.]()![](_page_1412_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Diverticulosis and Diverticulitis**]\nDiverticulosis is a common disorder in which small, saclike swellings (called diverticula) develop in the walls of the lowest part of the colon (the longest section of\n\nthe large intestine). In rare cases, diverticula can develop in other parts of the digestive tract such as the esophagus (pharyngeal pouch; see page 748), stomach, or small intestine. The cause of diverticulosis is unknown. Some doctors think that the condition may result from chronic constipation. Straining during bowel movements increases pressure on the wall of the colon, possibly causing a weak point in the wall to swell. Diverticulosis usually causes no symptoms and is often diagnosed by chance during tests done for another reason.\n\nWhen one or more of the diverticula become inflamed, the condition is called diverticulitis. Only 10 percent of people with diverticulosis develop diverticulitis. If untreated, diverticulitis can cause an abscess (pus-filled cavity) to form in the intestine. The abscess can rupture, causing inflammation of the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity (peritonitis; see page 759).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nDiverticulosis usually causes no symptoms. However, you may have mild abdominal tenderness, cramping in the lower left side of the abdomen (that is relieved after you pass gas or have a bowel movement), constipation, or occasional attacks of diarrhea. The diverticula may bleed, producing blood in the stool or significant bleeding from the rectum.\n\nIf you have diverticulitis, you will probably have severe abdominal pain and tenderness in the lower left side of your abdomen that gets worse when you press on the area, although diverticula can sometimes develop on the right side.

You should have a diagnostic procedure called colonoscopy (see page 767) on the following schedule:\n\n- Every 5 years if you have been diagnosed with adenomatous intestinal polyps.\n- Every 10 years starting at age 40, or 10 years younger than the age at which colon cancer in a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) was diagnosed.\n- Every 10 years starting at age 50 if you have no history of polyps or colon cancer.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Noncancerous and cancerous polyps]\nPolyps are growths in the inner lining (mucosa) of the wall of the colon and are usually made up of normal cells. When a polyp becomes cancerous, its cells grow and multiply abnormally. The abnormal cells may grow into the next layer of the wall of the colon (the submucosa). If the cancerous cells continue to multiply unchecked, the cells may invade blood vessels and metastasize (spread) throughout the body.\n\nDiagram illustrating a Noncancerous polyp.

A doctor may also order a barium X-ray (see page 767) of the colon.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIntestinal polyps are usually removed through the colonoscope during a colonoscopy. If the polyp is very large, your doctor may be able to remove part of it at that time or may refer you to a surgeon. If the polyp is an adenoma, the larger it is, the greater the risk that it is cancerous. However, sometimes the cancer cells are contained entirely within the polyp, and removal of the polyp is the only procedure necessary.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Familial Polyposis**]\nFamilial polyposis (also called familial adenomatous polyposis or polyposis coli) is a relatively rare genetic disorder in which hundreds or thousands of growths—polyps or cysts—form in the colon (the longest part of the large intestine) and sometimes in the stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). The polyps usually begin to form during puberty; 95 percent of people with familial polyposis have polyps by age 35.\n\nMost people with familial polyposis inherit the disorder from an affected parent. About 30 percent of cases result from a spontaneous change (mutation) in a gene that occurs during conception, which causes the disease to appear for the first time in a family. Because the abnormal gene is dominant (which means that it takes only one copy of the gene to cause the disease), each child of an affected person will have a 50 percent chance of inheriting the abnormal gene and having the disorder. Familial polyposis affects males and females equally and occurs in all racial and ethnic groups.\n\nThe polyps eventually become cancerous if they are not removed. However, familial polyposis is responsible for only 1 percent of cases of colon cancer (see next page). The average age at which colon cancer develops in people with untreated familial polyposis is 39 years. If you have familial polyposis, a genetic counselor (see page 952) can help you understand the disorder and evaluate your risk of passing it on to your children.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nAlthough the polyps begin to grow at puberty, most adolescents with familial polyposis have no symptoms. As the disease progresses, symptoms may include blood and mucus in the stool, bleeding from the rectum, a change in bowel habits, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or weight loss. People with some types of familial polyposis tend to produce extra tissue in the form of cysts or bony growths in other parts of the body, including the skin, bones, eyes, thyroid gland, and abdomen.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose familial polyposis, your doctor will ask you if anyone in your family has ever been diagnosed with intestinal polyps or colon cancer. He or she will recommend a genetic test that detects the gene mutation that causes familial polyposis.

If possible, the two severed ends of the colon are sewn or stapled together to maintain a passageway for stool. When it is not possible to maintain this passageway, an opening called a stoma is made in the abdominal wall, through which stool can pass into a bag. The procedure is called a colostomy when the colon opens through the stoma and an ileostomy when the small intestine opens through the stoma.\n\nA colectomy is surgical removal of part or all of the colon. In a partial colectomy, the diseased part of the colon is removed and the two severed ends of the colon are joined together. The surgeon makes a temporary or permanent opening called a colostomy to allow stool to pass directly outside the body through an artificial opening in the abdominal wall (instead of the normal route through the large intestine and rectum). If the colostomy is temporary, the stoma will be closed after the surgically severed ends of the colon heal and fuse together.\n\nIn a total colectomy, which is sometimes done for inflammatory bowel disease (see page 764), the entire colon is removed. The rectum may or may not be removed. If the rectum is removed, the doctor may perform an ileostomy.\n\n**Colostomy and ileostomy** In a colostomy, a surgeon creates an artificial connection between the interior passageway of the colon and the outside of the body. In an ileostomy, the artificial connection is between the ileum of the small intestine and the outside of the body. The surgically created opening is called a stoma.\n\nDiagram illustrating the preparation for a colostomy. The figure shows a male torso with the site of incision marked.

He or she then creates an artificial opening called a stoma, through which stool can be eliminated. He or she makes an incision in the abdomen and brings part of the colon through the incision in a procedure called a colostomy. The severed edges of the colon are then stitched to the skin at the edge of the incision to make the stoma. A bag to collect stool can be attached to the skin around the stoma with an adhesive. The bag is replaced after each bowel movement.\n\nDiagram illustrating the anatomy before a partial colostomy. The figure shows the stomach, duodenum, colon, and small intestine.

The cancer is described in terms of how large the primary tumor is, the degree to which the tumor has invaded surrounding tissue, and the extent to which it has spread to lymph glands or other areas of the body. Staging helps a doctor determine the most appropriate treatment. Doctors stage colon cancer in the following way:\n\n- **Stage 0** The cancer is limited to the innermost lining of the colon or rectum.\n- **Stage I** The cancer has spread to the outer part of the lining of the colon or rectum.\n- **Stage II** The cancer has spread from the intestine to nearby organs or tissues but not to the lymph nodes.\n- **Stage III** The cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes.\n- **Stage IV** The cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the liver or lungs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nFor colon cancer that has not spread to other organs, surgery is the most effective treatment. If the cancer is confined to the colon, the surgeon will remove the growth and the surrounding areas of the colon on either side of the tumor in a procedure called colectomy (see previous page", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "colectomy", "relation": "treats", "tail": "diverticulitis"}, {"head": "colectomy", "relation": "treats", "tail": "ulcerative colitis"}, {"head": "colectomy", "relation": "treats", "tail": "cancer of the large intestine (colon)"}, {"head": "colostomy", "relation": "is a type of", "tail": "colectomy"}, {"head": "ileostomy", "relation": "is a type of", "tail": "colectomy"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "colon", "relation": "removed by", "tail": "[Event: colectomy]"}, {"head": "stoma", "relation": "created for", "tail": "[Event: colostomy or ileostomy]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

If a blood clot has developed in a hemorrhoid and is causing extreme pain, your doctor may remove the clot. If a hemorrhoid does not heal, the doctor may wrap a rubber band around its base to cut off its blood supply; without a supply of blood, the hemorrhoid withers and falls off. Other techniques used to remove hemorrhoids include destroying tissue by freezing (cryosurgery), injecting a chemical to shrink the hemorrhoid, or using heat (infrared coagulation) to seal the hemorrhoid and prevent it from bleeding. Only in rare cases are hemorrhoids removed surgically (called a hemorrhoidectomy). In this procedure, a\n\nsurgeon stretches the hemorrhoid, ties it off at the base, and slices it off using a scalpel or laser. The laser seals the blood vessels as it cuts.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > Self-Help for Anal Itching]\nAnal itching (also called pruritus ani) is a common problem, usually caused by hemorrhoids or irritation. In children, the itching may be caused by pinworms (see page 444), especially if the itching is worse at night. Anal itching is more prevalent in older people because the skin becomes drier and less elastic with age.\n\nIf you have anal itching, your doctor may recommend the following tips to help heal irritated tissue and relieve the itching:\n\n- Soak in a warm bath once or twice a day.\n- Cleanse the anal area with mild soap and water (or just water) and dry the area gently but thoroughly.\n- Use unscented soaps, lotions, and toilet paper to avoid irritation.\n- When you are away from home, carry with you prepackaged pads that contain soothing lotions or oils to clean the anal area.\n- Don't scratch or rub the inflamed area.\n- Wear cotton underwear to keep the area dry.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > Self-Help for Hemorrhoids]\nIf you have hemorrhoids:\n\n- Don't delay having a bowel movement, or strain or sit too long on the toilet.\n- Eat plenty of high-fiber foods (such as fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain or bran cereals or breads) and drink lots of fluids (especially water) to make your stool soft and easy to pass.\n- To increase the water content of your stool, which makes it softer and easier to pass, take a psyllium-based fiber supplement (not a laxative) with a large glass of water.\n- Exercise regularly to stimulate bowel movements to help relieve constipation.\n\n- If you have protruding hemorrhoids, push them back in with your finger after every bowel movement.\n- Apply an ice compress to the anal area to help relieve swelling.\n- Sit on a doughnut-shaped pillow to ease pressure on sore areas.\n- If you are having a painful attack, rest in bed.\n- To relieve anal itching and irritation, use the self-help tips in the box above.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Rectal Abscesses]\nRectal abscesses are pus-filled cavities surrounded by inflamed tissue that can develop in the tissue surrounding the anus, deeper in the rectum (between the muscles of the anal sphincter), or in tissues higher up in the rectum. People who have an inflammatory bowel disease (see page 764), leukemia (see page 621), or diabetes (see page 889), or who engage in anal sex are at increased risk of developing rectal abscesses. If a rectal abscess is untreated, it can lead to an anal fistula (an abnormal channel from the anal canal to the skin's surface; see right).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Rectal Abscesses > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of rectal abscesses include intense pain in the rectal area (especially during a bowel movement), and bleeding and a discharge of pus-filled mucus from the rectum. A rectal abscess outside the body may be swollen and feel warm. You also may have a fever with chills.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Rectal Abscesses > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nTo diagnose a rectal abscess, a doctor performs a digital rectal examination (see page 144) to feel for the abscess. He or she may also perform a procedure called anoscopy (see page 766) to examine the anus and rectum to look for an abscess. Ultrasound (see page 111) may also be used to help detect an abscess in the rectum. An abscess in the rectum is usually drained surgically. If the abscess is deep, general anesthesia may be necessary. The doctor will prescribe antibiotics to kill the bacteria.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Anal Fissures]\nAn anal fissure is an elongated ulcer (sore) that extends upward into the anal canal from the anal opening. The cause is not known, but it may result from passing a large, hard stool. An anal fissure can also occur from injury to the delicate tissues of the anal canal during anal sex.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Anal Fissures > *Symptoms*]\nAn anal fissure is easily irritated during a bowel movement.

Fecal incontinence may be caused by damage to the muscles or nerves of the anal sphincter or rectum, diarrhea, lack of elasticity of the walls of the rectum, or dysfunction of the pelvic floor. Damage to the muscles or nerves can occur during childbirth, especially if the doctor uses forceps or does an episiotomy (see page 533). Surgery of the anus or rectum (such as to treat hemorrhoids; see page 778) can also damage the sphincter. Straining during a bowel movement or having a stroke (see page 669) or another disorder that affects the nerves, such as diabetes (see page 889) or multiple sclerosis (see page 696), can also cause fecal incontinence. Having rectal surgery, radiation therapy (see page 23), or an inflammatory bowel disease (see page 764) can cause scarring that makes the walls of the rectum stiff—the rectum can't stretch and hold the usual amount of stool. Fecal incontinence can also be a consequence of rectal prolapse (see left).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have fecal incontinence, your doctor will perform a physical examination. He or she may also order a series of tests such as manometry (see page 751) to check the tightness of your anal sphincter and the function of your rectum, an ultrasound (see page 111) to evaluate the structure of the anal sphincter, and electromyography to test for nerve damage. The doctor may perform a procedure that measures how much stool your rectum can hold and how well it holds and eliminates stool. During a procedure called sigmoidoscopy (see page 144), the doctor will examine your lower intestine and rectum to look for signs of disease such as inflammation, growths, or scarring.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe treatment of fecal incontinence depends on the cause. Your doctor may recommend changes in your diet and eating habits such as avoiding particular foods (for example, caffeine relaxes the anal sphincter muscle), eating small meals more frequently, eating foods with more fiber, and drinking lots of water to avoid dehydration. Your doctor also may prescribe medications such as vitamin supplements and antidiarrheals. Exercises to strengthen the pelvic muscles (Kegel exercises; see page 874) or training the bowels to empty at a particular time of day can be helpful. Because constant contact with stool can cause anal skin inflammation, use the tips on page 778 to soothe irritated anal tissue. If fecal incontinence is the result of injury to the pelvic floor, rectum, or anal sphincter, surgery may be necessary to repair the damage. Some people who have chronic fecal incontinence decide, after discussing it with their doctor, to have a colostomy (see page 776).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Infections of the Digestive Tract**]\nThe intestines normally contain harmless bacteria; some bacteria that inhabit the intestines have beneficial functions such as manufacturing vitamins. An infection of the digestive tract occurs when infectious agents, such as viruses or bacteria, multiply rapidly in the stomach or intestines. The presence of microorganisms in the digestive tract is not considered an infection unless the microorganisms exist in large numbers and cause symptoms.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Gastroenteritis]\nGastroenteritis is a general term that refers to irritation and inflammation of the digestive tract, especially the stomach and intestines. It is most often caused by a viral infection that spreads easily from person to person—even without having direct contact or consuming contaminated food or water. Viral infections are the most common cause of the 24- to 48-hour attacks of vomiting and diarrhea that are commonly called stomach or intestinal flu.\n\nEating or drinking contaminated food or water (food poisoning; see page 783) can also cause gastroenteritis. Gastroenteritis that occurs after eating something that contains a toxic substance, such as a nonedible mushroom or a rhubarb leaf, is not actually food poisoning but can cause a severe attack. Eggs, milk products, and shellfish can cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to those foods (see page 915).\n\nAnother possible cause of gastroenteritis is a change in the population of bacteria that normally live in the digestive tract. If you have an illness that weakens your immune system, or if you suddenly make changes in your diet (such as when visiting another country), the balance of bacteria in your digestive tract can become disturbed. When some strains of bacteria become stronger and multiply at the expense of others, the result can be an upset stomach and irritated intestines. Antibiotic drugs also can disturb the bacterial equilibrium in the intestines, permitting unchecked growth of bacteria that can lead to infections such as the common yeast infection candidiasis (see page 880).\n\nThe severity of an attack of gastroenteritis depe", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "diabetes", "relation": "causes", "tail": "damage to the muscles or nerves"}, {"head": "forceps", "relation": "causes", "tail": "damage to the muscles or nerves"}, {"head": "episiotomy", "relation": "causes", "tail": "damage to the muscles or nerves"}, {"head": "surgery of the anus or rectum", "relation": "causes", "tail": "damage to the sphincter"}, {"head": "straining during a bowel movement", "relation": "causes", "tail": "damage to the muscles or nerves"}, {"head": "stroke", "relation": "causes", "tail": "damage to the muscles or nerves"}, {"head": "diabetes", "relation": "causes", "tail": "multiple sclerosis"}, {"head": "multiple sclerosis", "relation": "causes", "tail": "damage to the muscles or nerves"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "uses", "tail": "[Event: forceps]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "performs", "tail": "[Event: episiotomy]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "experiences", "tail": "[Event: damage to the muscles or nerves]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "undergoes", "tail": "[Event: surgery of the anus or rectum]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "participates in", "tail": "[Event: straining during a bowel movement]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "experiences", "tail": "[Event: stroke]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: damage to the muscles or nerves]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: fecal incontinence]"}, {"head": "[Event: surgery of the anus or rectum]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: damage to the sphincter]"}, {"head": "[Event: straining during a bowel movement]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: damage to the muscles or nerves]"}, {"head": "[Event: stroke]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: damage to the muscles or nerves]"}]}, "status": "success"}

The liver is the heaviest organ in the body, spreading across the upper right part of the abdomen behind the lower ribs. The liver is the body's chemical factory, performing vital functions such as converting food into nutrients the body can use; storing nutrients including fats, vitamins, sugars, and iron until the body needs them; producing proteins necessary for blood clotting; and removing or neutralizing potentially harmful substances such as alcohol. Most of the cholesterol in your body is made by your liver from saturated fats in foods that you eat (such as whole-milk dairy products and red meat).\n\nTo aid digestion, the liver secretes a fluid called bile, which helps neutralize stomach acid and break down fat. Bile trickles through tiny tubes (called bile ducts) into the gallbladder, a baglike collecting organ that rests against the lower back of the liver to absorb water and store bile. During digestion, the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine, from the stomach) releases a hormone that stimulates the gallbladder to contract and release bile into the duodenum through the common bile duct.\n\nThe pancreas lies just behind the lower part of the stomach. The pancreas makes insulin, a hormone that controls the body's use of sugar for energy and regulates the body's use of fat and amino acids, which are essential for storing energy and building proteins. The pancreas also makes enzymes, digestive juices that flow down the pancreatic duct into the duodenum, where they break food down into particles small enough to be absorbed and used by the body.\n\n**Liver, gallbladder, and pancreas** Although the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas are not actually considered organs of the digestive system, each plays an important role in digestion and in enabling the body to use nutrients for energy. The liver spreads across the upper right abdomen behind the lower ribs. The gallbladder rests against the lower back of the liver. The pancreas lies just behind the lower part of the stomach. The pancreas is connected to the duodenum (the upper part of the small intestine at the exit from the stomach) by the common bile duct. The bile duct transports the digestive fluid bile from the gallbladder to the intestines to help in the digestion of fats.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the human digestive system. The main diagram shows the liver, stomach, gallbladder, duodenum, and pancreas. An inset magnifies the liver, stomach, gallbladder, and common bile duct, showing the liver filtering bilirubin into the bile ducts, which carry it to the gallbladder, where it is stored and eventually excreted into the small intestine.]()![](_page_1439_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Jaundice]\nJaundice is a condition that results from excess bilirubin in the blood; bilirubin is a yellow pigment by-product of the breakdown of aging red blood cells. An excess of the yellow pigment discolors the skin and the whites of the eyes (see pages 118 and 127). Normally, the liver filters bilirubin from the bloodstream and excretes it into the bile ducts, which carry it to the gallbladder. From the gallbladder, bilirubin eventually flows into the small intestine, where most of it is broken down by bacteria that are normally present in the intestine. Bilirubin is eliminated from the body as pigmented compounds in stool.\n\nJaundice usually occurs as a result of liver diseases, including the viral infection hepatitis (see next page), cirrhosis (see page 790), cancers that spread to the liver, or blockage of a bile duct, or as a reaction to a medication. Jaundice can also result from an obstruction of the bile ducts—such as gallstones (see page 793) or pancreatic tumors (see page 800)—\n\nwhich can prevent bilirubin from entering the intestines, causing it to build up in the blood. Jaundice can occur in hemolytic anemia (see page 616), in which red blood cells are destroyed at an excessive rate, releasing bilirubin into the blood. In hemolytic anemia, the liver functions normally but is unable to remove bilirubin from the blood rapidly enough.\n\nIf you notice that the whites of your eyes are yellow and your skin tone is yellowish, see your doctor right away.

If you have hepatitis, your doctor will recommend that you avoid alcohol altogether. But even people without liver disease should avoid taking acetaminophen if they drink alcohol regularly (especially if they consume more than two or three drinks a day).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > Hepatitis C]\nHepatitis C is inflammation of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus, which is more likely than the other hepatitis viruses to become chronic. The disease can progress slowly for 10 to 40 years, eventually causing liver damage in some people. The infection is transmitted through contact with an infected person's blood. Those most at risk of contracting hepatitis C are intravenous drug users who share needles with an infected person, or people who have unsanitary tattooings or body piercings. Less commonly, the infection can be transmitted sexually.\n\nThe virus used to be spread primarily through blood transfusions, but all donor blood in the United States is now screened for the virus. However, you could have hepatitis C if you received a blood transfusion or organ transplant before 1992 or blood products (such as clotting factors used for treating hemophilia; see page 618) before 1987. Nearly 4 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C and, because it seldom causes symptoms, most do not know they have it. Some doctors recommend being tested for the virus even if you don't have symptoms. If the test shows that you are infected, you can take antiviral medications such as interferon and ribavirin to slow progression of the disease and prevent liver damage. Ask your doctor about being tested for hepatitis C.\n\nHepatitis C is diagnosed with a simple blood test that detects antibodies that the body produces to fight the virus. The antibodies can be detected as early as 5 weeks or up to 16 weeks after exposure to the virus. If the test result is positive, the test is repeated to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf your doctor thinks you may have viral hepatitis, he or she will ask you about your risk factors, perform a physical examination, and order a blood test to look for one of the viruses. He or she will want to determine which hepatitis virus you are infected with and whether you have any liver damage or liver function problems, and evaluate the severity of the illness. Blood tests may be repeated at regular intervals to monitor the health of your liver and to watch for any signs of liver damage.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf you have hepatitis and your symptoms are mild, your doctor will probably recommend that you stay home and rest for a week or two, avoid spreading the infection to others, eat a nutritious diet, and avoid alcohol (which can promote liver damage). If your symptoms are more severe or if laboratory tests indicate that you have liver damage, you may be admitted to the hospital for evaluation and treatment. You may have a liver biopsy (in which a sample of tissue is withdrawn from your liver through a needle for study under a microscope). If you have hepatitis C, you will probably be given antiviral medications such as interferon and ribavirin; for hepatitis B, you will be given lamivudine.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > **Hepatitis Vaccinations**]\nHepatitis B vaccinations are required for all American children and recommended for adults who are at risk of exposure to the virus, such as people who have several sex partners, health care workers, college students who live in dormitories, or people who live with an infected person. Ask your doctor about having a hepatitis B vaccination.\n\nIf you are planning a trip to a developing country, where hepatitis A is often widespread, ask your doctor about having a vaccination for hepatitis A. An injection of immune globulin (infection-fighting proteins) can provide immunity to the virus for 2 to 3 months. The two-shot vaccination against hepatitis A provides even more protection after the second shot, although exactly how long the protection lasts is unknown.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Preventing Hepatitis B and C*]\nYou can avoid becoming infected with hepatitis B or C or transmitting the virus to other people if you are already infected by taking the following steps:\n\n- If you have hepatitis B, have everyone in your household get tested for the virus. If the test shows that someone is not immune to the virus (and does not already have it), he or she should be vaccinated against hepatitis B.\n- Practice safer sex (see page 477) because hepatitis B is a common sexually transmitted disease.\n- Tell your sex partners that you have hepatitis B.

Your doctor will diagnose a form of chronic hepatitis if your health does not return to normal after an acute attack of jaundice and if liver function tests continue to be abnormal. If you are diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C, the doctor will test the levels of two liver enzymes—alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)—that are released when liver cells are injured or die. These levels can fluctuate from elevated to normal during the illness. If your liver enzyme levels are normal, your doctor will test them regularly over a 6- to 12-month period. If your enzyme levels continue to be normal during this time, he or she may recommend blood tests less frequently, such as once a year. Your doctor may order a liver biopsy (examination of a small sample of tissue taken from the liver for examination under a microscope) to help evaluate your condition and determine appropriate treatment.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nDepending on your general health and the results of the liver biopsy, your doctor may be able to determine if the disease is likely to clear up without treatment. If the results of blood tests and a liver biopsy show that the disease could progress to cirrhosis, your doctor will recommend treatment based on whether you have hepatitis B or C. In either case, the doctor will recommend that you have a vaccination against pneumonia (see page 660), hepatitis A, and hepatitis B (if you have hepatitis C) to prevent further strain on your liver. (There is no vaccination for hepatitis C.)\n\nTo treat chronic active hepatitis B, a doctor will prescribe an antiviral medication such as interferon alfa-2b or lamivudine. Injections of interferon are usually given for 4 to 6 months. Interferon can cause a number of side effects including fatigue, headache, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, depression, and thinning hair. Because interferon can depress the blood cell-producing bone marrow, you will have regular blood tests to measure your blood cell levels. Lamivudine is taken by mouth for at least a year. Lamivudine is not quite as effective in eliminating hepatitis B as interferon and, in some cases, the virus becomes resistant to lamivudine.\n\nTo treat chronic hepatitis C, a doctor may prescribe an antiviral medication such as interferon or ribavirin, often in combination. Interferon is given by injection; ribavirin is taken by mouth. The side effects of ribavirin include sudden, severe anemia (see page 610) and birth defects; for this reason you should not get pregnant or get anyone pregnant while you are taking ribavirin and for 6 months after your treatment ends.\n\nMany people with chronic hepatitis C respond to treatment at least temporarily, and some of them become virus-free after 6 months of therapy. In others, however, the disease progresses over a period of 30 to 40 years to cirrhosis and eventually liver failure. A liver transplant (see next page) is frequently recommended for people who have end-stage hepatitis C.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Liver Transplants]\nIn liver transplantation, a diseased liver is removed and replaced with a healthy liver (or part of a liver) from a donor. About 80 to 90 percent of people survive liver transplant surgery. Survival rates have improved over the past several years thanks to drugs such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, which suppress the immune system to prevent it from attacking and damaging the donor liver.\n\nTransplants are usually recommended for people whose liver has been severely damaged by chronic cirrhosis or for children who have congenital\n\n(present at birth) abnormalities of the bile ducts. Transplants can be successful in people who stop drinking alcohol permanently. However, a transplant is not recommended for people who have advanced cirrhosis caused by drinking alcohol if alcohol has already damaged other organs, such as the heart.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Liver Transplants > *The procedure*]\nFor a liver transplant, a person receiving the transplant is given general anesthesia, and the transplant surgeon makes an incision in the upper part of the abdomen. The surgeon then cuts the major blood vessels—the vena cava, the hepatic artery, and the portal vein—and the bile duct to remove the diseased liver. The donor liver is put in place and connected to the blood vessels and bile duct. In some cases, a small tube is inserted into the bile duct to allow bile to drain out of the body into a small bag.\n\nThe transplant recipient is connected to a ventilator to assist with breathing until his or her condition stabilizes. The new liver starts to function immediately. The bile-collecting bag may remain attached to the tube for a week or more. Once the bag is removed, the tube may be capped but will remain in place for several months to enable the doctor to perform tests to monitor the transplant.

He or she will press on your abdomen to feel your liver and, if it feels harder or larger than normal, the doctor will order blood tests to see if you have liver damage. The doctor may also want to examine your liver on an image such as a CT scan (see page 112), an ultrasound (see page 111), or a radioisotope scan (which highlights the liver using a harmless radioactive substance). In some cases, a doctor will want to look at the liver directly using laparoscopy, in which a viewing tube (laparoscope) is inserted through a small incision in the abdomen to transmit pictures to a computer screen. To confirm a diagnosis of cirrhosis, a liver biopsy may be done. During a liver biopsy, a doctor inserts a needle through the abdomen into the liver to remove a small sample of tissue to examine for signs of scarring or disease.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe treatment of cirrhosis depends on the underlying cause. For example, if it is caused by alcohol dependence, your doctor will ask you to avoid drinking alcohol. Abstaining from alcohol can help prevent cirrhosis from getting worse and should enable you to lead a relatively active life. If the cirrhosis arose from hepatitis (see page 786), your doctor will prescribe medications such as interferon to treat a hepatitis infection or corticosteroids to suppress the abnormal immune response in autoimmune hepatitis.\n\nIf you have nausea, your doctor can prescribe medication to relieve it. He or she will recommend that you eat frequent small meals or snacks during the day rather than three large meals. Don't take any over-the-counter medications, including vitamin supplements and herbal remedies, without talking to your doctor, because your liver cannot filter substances normally.\n\nAny complications of cirrhosis will also be treated. For example, if you have fluid buildup, your doctor will recommend a low-sodium diet and diuretics (drugs that remove fluid from the body). He or she may recommend removing fluid from your abdomen through a needle in a procedure called paracentesis (see page 759). For portal hypertension, your doctor may prescribe a blood pressure medication such as a beta blocker. A low-protein diet can help decrease the buildup of toxins in the blood and brain that can occur when the liver is not filtering normally. If complications cannot be controlled, or if the liver is so damaged that it stops functioning, a liver transplant (see previous page) can be lifesaving.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Tumors of the Liver]\nLiver tumors can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Benign tumors in the liver are extremely rare; if they are detected, they can usually be removed safely and completely.\n\nTwo types of cancerous tumors develop in the liver—those that have spread there from another part of the body (metastases) and those that originate in the liver (primary cancers). About one third of all cancers in the body eventually spread to the liver. Once a cancer has spread to the liver, the outlook is poor. Cancers that originate in the liver are rare. These tumors often result from infection with the hepatitis B or C virus or from cirrhosis (see page 790).\n\nLiver cancer is twice as common in men as in women and usually is diagnosed after age 60. People who have a family history of this cancer are at increased risk.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nIf a person has liver cancer that has spread from elsewhere in the body, he or she may first experience symptoms from the primary cancer, most frequently the breast (see page 857), lung (see page 646), or gastrointestinal tract (see page 775). As liver cancer develops, it causes loss of weight and appetite, feelings of fullness, pain in the upper abdomen on the right side (possibly extending to the back and shoulder), bloating, weakness, fatigue, and nausea and vomiting. A person may eventually develop jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes; see page 785) as the liver is damaged.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf your doctor thinks that you may have liver cancer, he or she will perform a physical examination and feel your abdomen for lumps in the liver or nearby organs or changes in the shape or size of organs. He or she also will feel your abdomen for an abnormal buildup of fluid and will examine your skin and eyes to look for jaundice. You may have blood tests to detect any problems and to evaluate liver function.\n\nYour doctor may examine your liver using an imaging procedure such as a CT scan (see page 112), ultrasound (see page 111), MRI (see page 113), or angiogram (see page 110).

The doctor will feel your abdomen for signs of swelling of the liver or spleen or fluid buildup in the lining of the abdomen. He or she will also order tests to measure the level of copper in your blood, urine, and liver. An eye examination may be done to look for a rusty-brown ring around the cornea (called the Kayser-Fleischer ring) that is characteristic of Wilson's disease. The earlier the diagnosis is made, the less damage to the liver and brain and the better the outcome.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nWilson's disease is treated with zinc (which blocks the absorption of copper) or penicillamine or trientine (which help remove copper from tissues). You will need to take the medication throughout your life. You will also need to avoid eating copper-rich foods such as mushrooms, nuts, chocolate, dried fruit, liver, and shellfish. Ask your doctor if you should take a zinc supplement to help prevent your intestines from absorbing copper.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Gallstones]\nStones of varying composition sometimes form in the gallbladder, the reservoir in which the digestive substance bile collects. Bile flows from the liver to the gallbladder, which excretes bile into the intestines to help neutralize stomach acid and aid in the digestion of fat. Bile is rich in cholesterol (a fat that is manufactured and excreted by the liver) and bilirubin (a substance formed from the breakdown of old red blood cells). Sometimes, if the balance of the cholesterol and bilirubin in the bile is upset, a tiny solid particle can form in the gallbladder. The particle may grow to become a gallstone as more cholesterol or, less often, bilirubin builds up around it. Some people may have only one gallstone, while others have several.\n\nAn estimated 20 million people in the United States have gallstones, with 1 million new cases diagnosed each year. Autopsy studies have shown that 80 percent of all people who reach 90 years of age have gallstones when they die.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Gallstones > Common sites of gallstones]\nGallstones may remain in the gallbladder or pass easily through the bile duct into the upper part of the small intestine (the duodenum) without causing symptoms. However, problems can develop if a gallstone gets trapped in the cystic duct or in a bile duct.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the anatomy of the gallbladder and bile ducts. The Gallbladder is shown connected to the Common hepatic duct and the Cystic duct. The Common bile duct is shown connecting to the Common hepatic duct.

However, some gallstones flow out of the liver in bile and get stuck in the common bile duct. A stone in the bile duct causes severe pain in the right side or in the center of the upper abdomen, which can radiate around the ribs or through to the back; this pain is called biliary colic. Biliary colic results when the gallbladder and the muscle of the bile duct clamp down and try to empty the stone into the intestines. If the stone falls back into the gallbladder, or is forced along the bile duct into the intestines, the blockage goes away and the pain quickly subsides. For this reason, the pain tends to build to a peak over a period of a few hours and then fade. A person usually has nausea and vomiting. If you have severe pain on your right side or in your upper abdomen, call your doctor immediately or go to the nearest hospital emergency department.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Gallstones > Biliary colic]\nA gallstone can sometimes get stuck in the common bile duct, causing pain in the right side or in the center of the upper abdomen.

In some cases, a blockage in the common bile duct is opened using ERCP (see above), in which a wire coil (stent) is inserted into the blockage and expanded; the stent remains in place to keep the duct open. If the liver starts to fail, the doctor may recommend a liver transplant (see page 790).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > ERCP]\nTo diagnose and treat various problems in the bile ducts including tumors, cysts, and narrowing, doctors use a procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). It is also used to help evaluate jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes; see page 785). In ERCP, an endoscope (a flexible viewing tube) is passed down the esophagus, through the stomach, and into the duodenum. After introducing a dye into the bile and pancreatic ducts, the doctor can see any stones or other abnormalities in the duct on an X-ray image. If a stone is found, a tiny device can be passed through the endoscope to grab the stone (or stones) and pull it out or to dislodge it and allow it to pass through the newly enlarged opening to the duodenum.\n\nThe procedure takes from 30 minutes to 2 hours. If the procedure is done for diagnosis only, you will be able to leave the hospital after the sedative wears off, probably after about 1 to 2 hours. If a gallstone was removed or other treatment given, you may need to stay overnight in the hospital.

Cholangiocarcinomas, which can develop anywhere along a bile duct, are usually slow-growing and don't cause symptoms until they block the duct. The tumors occur in people of both sexes equally and are usually diagnosed after age 65. People who have primary sclerosing cholangitis (see page 794) or another disorder that causes chronic\n\ninflammation in the bile ducts have an increased risk of developing cholangiocarcinomas.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of a cholangiocarcinoma include clay-colored stool, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes; see page 785), itching of the skin, pain in the right upper abdomen that may radiate to the back, loss of appetite, weight loss, and fever and chills.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have symptoms of a cholangiocarcinoma, your doctor will order tests to look for a tumor or obstruction in a bile duct. You may have an imaging procedure such as a CT scan (see page 112) or ultrasound (see page 111) of your abdomen, or ERCP (see above). In ERCP, the doctor passes a flexible viewing tube (called an endoscope) down your esophagus, through the stomach, and into the small intestine, and introduces a dye into the bile duct. Another diagnostic imaging test is a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTCA), in which a thin, flexible needle is inserted through the skin of the upper right side of your abdomen into the liver. An X-ray machine called a fluoroscope transmits images onto a monitor, guiding the doctor as he or she inserts the needle into the bile duct and injects a dye that will show up on the monitor and reveal any abnormalities in the bile duct. If a tumor shows up on an image, the doctor will take a sample of cells during the ERCP or PTCA for examination in the laboratory to look for cancer cells and to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe treatment for cholangiocarcinoma is to surgically remove the tumor, if possible, which can result in a cure if the cancer is found early and has not spread from the bile duct.

If gallbladder cancer has been found on a biopsy or during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the gallbladder will be removed through a larger incision in the abdomen to avoid releasing cancer cells into the abdominal cavity while removing the gallbladder. Part of the liver near the gallbladder and lymph nodes in the abdomen may also be removed.\n\nRadiation therapy (see page 23) may be used alone or before or after surgery. Chemotherapy (see page 23) may be given in combination with radiation therapy to make cancer cells more sensitive to the radiation. These therapies are sometimes used to help shrink a tumor before surgery.\n\nIf your cancer is detected at a later stage, or if it recurs after treatment, your doctor may talk to you about participating in a clinical trial that evaluates experimental treatments for gallbladder cancer.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Acute Pancreatitis]\nAcute pancreatitis is a condition characterized by sudden, severe inflammation of the pancreas. Worldwide, about half of people who develop acute pancreatitis have gallstones. Most cases of acute pancreatitis in the United States are caused by alcohol abuse. Other possible causes include reactions to medications such as acetaminophen, sulfa drugs, thiazide diuretics, some antibiotics, zidovudine (an AIDS drug), or mercaptopurine (an immune-suppressing drug); a penetrating duodenal ulcer (see page 755); hyperparathyroidism (see page 904); or an abdominal injury. The condition can also result from pancreatic cancer (see page 800), elevated levels of triglycerides or calcium in the blood, or anatomical abnormalities.\n\nMost people recover completely after their first attack of pancreatitis. The major danger is shock (see page 579), which can result from internal bleeding around the pancreas and can be fatal. Acute pancreatitis can sometimes lead to chronic, recurring attacks.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe primary symptom of acute pancreatitis is severe pain in the center of the upper abdomen. It often begins 12 to 24 hours after eating a large meal or drinking an excessive amount of alcohol. The pain seems to bore through to the back and is accompanied by vomiting. In severe cases, a person can become extremely ill and feverish and have bruise marks on his or her abdomen from internal bleeding around the pancreas. Cystlike blisters (pseudocysts) sometimes form on the pancreas after an attack. If they cause symptoms such as pain, they may need to be removed surgically or drained.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have symptoms of acute pancreatitis, your doctor will admit you to the hospital. To make a diagnosis, the doctor will order a CT scan (see page 112) to examine the pancreas and blood tests to measure levels of some pancreatic enzymes and other proteins that are linked to acute pancreatitis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf you have acute pancreatitis, you will probably be given a pain reliever and should not eat or drink (fasting reduces the levels of pancreatic juices). Shock is treated with fluids given intravenously (through a vein). If you have a bacterial infection, you will be given antibiotics. As you recover, you can gradually start eating and drinking again. Your doctor will tell you to avoid alcohol to prevent chronic pancreatitis (see below). After you have recovered from the attack of acute pancreatitis, your doctor will recommend an ultrasound scan (see page 111) to look for gallstones to determine if they were the cause of the attack. If you have gallstones, the doctor may recommend having them removed (see page 795). If pancreatitis is severe, debridement (removal) of part of the inflamed tissue of the pancreas may be required.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Chronic Pancreatitis]\nChronic pancreatitis is a disease of the pancreas that develops gradually, usually after several years of alcohol abuse (see page 733). Chronic pancreatitis occurs when digestive enzymes attack and destroy the pancreas and nearby tissues, causing scarring. As the disease progresses, the pancreas eventually loses its ability to supply digestive juices and hormones (such as insulin). The resulting lack of digestive fluids can reduce the body's ability to absorb nutrients from food. If insulin is not available to push glucose into cells, glucose can build up in the blood, causing diabetes (see page 894).\n\nAlcohol-related chronic pancreatitis is more common in men than in women and usually develops between ages 30 and 40. The condition can sometimes be triggered by one attack of acute pancreatitis (see previous page), especially if the pancreatic ducts are damaged; this damage can cause inflammation in the pancreas that can kill pancreatic cells and lead to scarring. The pancreatic ducts can be damaged or blocked by an injury or by pseudocysts", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "chemotherapy", "relation": "treats", "tail": "cancer cells"}, {"head": "radiation therapy", "relation": "treats", "tail": "cancer cells"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "gallbladder", "relation": "removed through", "tail": "[Event: larger incision in the abdomen]"}, {"head": "part of liver near gallbladder", "relation": "removed", "tail": "[Event: during surgery]"}, {"head": "lymph nodes in abdomen", "relation": "removed", "tail": "[Event: during surgery]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment]"}]}, "status": "success"}

As the cancer progresses, symptoms can include loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea and vomiting, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes; see page 785). If the cancer affects the body and tail of the pancreas, a person will experience pain in the upper abdomen that may spread to the back. Cancer in the head of the pancreas often causes no symptoms until the tumor has become incurable.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have symptoms of pancreatic cancer, your doctor will want to rule out other possible causes, such as gallstones (see page 793). He or she will perform a physical examination to look for jaundice and feel your abdomen for any changes in the pancreas or surrounding organs and for a buildup of fluid. You will probably have blood, urine, and stool tests to look for abnormalities in substances such as the liver protein bilirubin, which can build up in the blood, urine, or stool if the common bile duct is blocked by a tumor.\n\nTo examine the pancreas, your doctor may also recommend an imaging procedure such as a CT scan (see page 112), an endoscopic ultrasound or MRI (see page 113), or ERCP (see page 796). In ERCP, the doctor can examine the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder ducts to look for narrowing or blockage of the ducts, which can be a sign of pancreatic cancer in some people. A doctor may take a sample of tissue from the pancreas during ERCP for examination under a microscope to look for cancer cells (biopsy).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nPancreatic cancer is difficult to control with available treatments. If pancreatic cancer is detected at an early stage, surgery to remove part or all of the pancreas may provide a cure. In one surgical procedure, part of the pancreas and part of the small intestine and\n\nsome of the tissue around the small intestine are removed. Enough of the pancreas remains to produce insulin and aid in digestion.\n\nAfter surgery for pancreatic cancer, chemotherapy (see page 23) and radiation therapy (see page 23) may be used alone or together, but they are generally not very effective for this type of cancer. When pancreatic cancer is detected at an advanced stage, the outlook is poor and treatment focuses on reducing the person's discomfort and the risk of complications. For example, if a tumor blocks the bile duct or duodenum (upper part of the small intestine), a doctor can create a bypass to allow fluids to flow through the digestive tract. Alternatively, a stent (a mesh tube) may be inserted into the duct or intestine to relieve the blockage and reduce the discomfort. Your doctor may talk with you about participating in a clinical trial of an experimental new treatment for pancreatic cancer.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Urinary Tract]\nAs your body uses up the nutrients from the food you eat, it produces toxic waste products that the blood carries to the kidneys and liver for removal. The kidneys filter the waste products from the blood, combine them with water, and excrete them from the body as urine. The production and excretion of urine are essential to maintain life.\n\nThe kidneys are bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist, at the back of the abdominal cavity, just above the waist and on each side of the spine. The functions of the kidneys include regulating blood pressure, maintaining the balance of body fluids and electrolytes (essential minerals that help regulate various body processes), eliminating waste products, and stimulating bone marrow to produce red blood cells.\n\nEach kidney contains more than 1 million tiny filtering units called nephrons, which allow amino acids, glucose, mineral salts, and waste products to pass from the blood into a series of microscopic tubes (tubules). The tubules reabsorb the essential nutrients (such as glucose, sodium, and potassium) and secrete waste products and excess water as urine. A steady stream of urine flows from the kidneys down to the bladder (a hollow, muscular organ in the pelvis that serves as a reservoir for urine) through a pair of narrow muscular tubes called ureters.\n\nDuring urination, the bladder contracts and expels urine through a larger muscular tube called the urethra. In males, the opening of the urethra is in the tip of the head of the penis; in females, the opening is directly in front of the vagina. The system that runs from the kidneys to the urethra is called the urinary tract.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Urinary Tract > The urinary tract]\nThe kidneys are at the back of the abdominal cavity, just above the waist and on each side of the spine. The ureters carry a steady stream of urine from the kidneys to the bladder, which is in the pelvis just behind the pubic bone. The bladder expels urine from the body through the urethra.\n\n![Diagram of the human urinary system showing the kid", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "cancer", "relation": "affects", "tail": "body"}, {"head": "cancer", "relation": "causes", "tail": "pain"}, {"head": "tumor", "relation": "becomes", "tail": "incurable"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "will perform", "tail": "[Event: physical examination]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "will want to rule out", "tail": "[Event: other possible causes]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

The male urethra is about 10 inches long and provides an outlet for semen as well as urine. The female urethra is about 1½ inches long and lies, with the bladder, just in front of the reproductive organs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The female urinary tract > Infections, Inflammation, and Injury]\nIn a healthy person, there are usually no microorganisms in the urinary tract and urine is sterile. However, infectious agents, especially bacteria, can enter the urinary tract from outside the body by moving up the urethra into the bladder. Microorganisms can also travel through the bloodstream to the urinary tract from other parts of the body. Once the infectious agents enter the urinary tract, they can multiply and spread, causing inflammation and disrupting normal functioning. Infections of the urinary tract can be acute (short term, usually severe) or chronic (long-lasting).\n\nInfection of the kidney is called pyelonephritis. Infection of the bladder is called cystitis. Kidney inflammation (nephritis) can occur without an infection, such as when it is caused by medication. Glomerulonephritis, inflammation of the glomeruli (the\n\nnetwork of tiny blood vessels inside the nephrons, the basic filtering units of the kidneys), can also occur without infection.\n\nDirect injury to the kidneys from a blow is rare because the kidneys are located at the back of the abdominal cavity and are protected by the rib cage and the fat and muscles of the back. The bladder is also well protected inside the pelvis. Direct injury to the urinary tract usually occurs along with severe injuries that require hospitalization, such as from a motor vehicle collision or a bullet wound.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Acute Pyelonephritis]\nAcute pyelonephritis is an infection of the kidneys that develops suddenly. The infection and the inflammation it causes affect mainly the tissue in the kidneys that contains tiny filtering units (nephrons). In most cases, the bacteria causing the infection come from the tissues surrounding the opening of the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body). If the bacteria multiply, they can enter the urethra and move up through the bladder and ureter to the kidneys. Acute pyelonephritis occurs more frequently in women than in men because the rectum is closer to the urethra in women and the urethra is shorter in women, increasing the likelihood that bacteria will enter the urinary tract.\n\nAcute pyelonephritis is more likely to occur when the normal flow of urine is partially blocked as a result of a condition such as pregnancy, kidney stones (see page 814), a tumor of the bladder (see page 813), or an enlarged prostate gland (see page 832). In these conditions, urine can collect and become stagnant, encouraging bacteria to multiply; the reduced urine flow prevents the bacteria from being easily eliminated from the urinary tract.\n\nAcute pyelonephritis can also develop when bacteria from an infection in another part of the body are carried through the bloodstream to the kidneys. The condition also sometimes occurs for unknown reasons in otherwise healthy people.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nOften the first symptom of acute pyelonephritis is sudden, intense pain in the back just above the waist. Although both kidneys may be affected, the pain is usually worse on one side of the body and spreads around that side and down into the groin. A person with acute pyelonephritis quickly develops a fever (often reaching 102°F to 104°F), which may produce chills or trembling and may be accompanied by nausea and\n\nvomiting. He or she may also experience difficult or painful urination and is likely to feel a constant urge to urinate, even when the bladder is empty. The urine is often cloudy and may appear reddish if blood has leaked into it. Rarely, this condition can lead to blood poisoning (see page 937) or shock (see page 579), or can be fatal.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nThe diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis is based on the symptoms. Your doctor will probably order blood tests or urine tests to determine the type of bacteria causing the infection. To check for conditions that may be obstructing the flow of urine through the urinary tract, your doctor may order an ultrasound (see page 111) or CT scan (see page 112) to evaluate your kidneys, or cystoscopy (see next page) to examine your bladder. He or she may order a voiding cystourethrogram (see next page) to check for vesicoureteral reflux, a condition in which urine flows backward from the bladder to the kidneys.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTreatment for acute pyelonep", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "male urethra", "relation": "is about", "tail": "10 inches long"}, {"head": "female urethra", "relation": "is about", "tail": "1½ inches long"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

Your doctor may also recommend that you have blood tests every 6 to 12 months to monitor your condition and watch for infections.\n\nTreatment for chronic pyelonephritis depends on how advanced the condition is when it is diagnosed. Surgery to repair the faulty valvelike action at the openings of the ureters into the bladder may be performed on a child, but the procedure is usually not performed on adults. Your doctor will treat any underlying cause of the chronic infections, such as kidney stones. He or she will probably prescribe an antibiotic to take for a specified amount of time whenever you have a urinary tract infection. Alternatively, a doctor may prescribe a low dose of an antibiotic to take for 3 to 6 months to try to keep the urine free of bacteria.\n\nBecause chronic pyelonephritis progresses slowly, your doctor may recommend that you watch for symptoms of kidney disease (such as frequent urination, abnormal-looking urine, pain in your side or back between the rib cage and hip, or puffiness in your face) and have regular checkups.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Glomerulonephritis]\nGlomerulonephritis refers to several related diseases that damage the kidneys. Some types of glomerulonephritis are linked to disorders in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the glomeruli (the network of tiny blood vessels inside the nephrons, the basic filtering units of the kidneys).\n\nIn a healthy kidney, blood passes through the glomeruli, which filter out chemicals including waste products. Most of the water and essential chemicals (such as glucose,\n\nsodium, and potassium) are reabsorbed into the bloodstream. The remaining waste materials collect as urine and pass down the ureters to the bladder for storage until you urinate.\n\nIf the glomeruli are damaged, red blood cells can leak through them into the urine, and protein can pass from the blood into the urine. If the loss of protein is excessive, it can cause a condition called nephrotic syndrome (see page 429). As more of the glomeruli are damaged, the kidneys become less efficient as filters and regulators of the chemical content of the blood. Waste products accumulate in the blood and can damage the kidneys.\n\nGlomerulonephritis can be mild or severe, and it may be acute, flaring up over a few days, or chronic, taking months or years to develop. The condition is not common, but approximately 60 percent of people who have end-stage kidney failure (see page 819) first have signs and symptoms of chronic glomerulonephritis. Acute glomerulonephritis can result from infections such as HIV (see page 909), hepatitis (see page 786), or endocarditis (see page 593). It also can occur as a result of inflammation or cancer anywhere in the body. Because the kidneys have a major role in regulating blood pressure, glomerulonephritis can eventually lead to high blood pressure (see page 574). Glomerulonephritis also may lead to chronic kidney failure (see page 817).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nMild, chronic glomerulonephritis produces no symptoms. In many cases, a doctor detects the condition with blood or urine tests performed for another purpose. In some cases, small amounts of blood in the urine may cause it to look smoky; larger amounts of blood make the urine look bright red.\n\nIn severe, acute glomerulonephritis, you may feel generally ill, with drowsiness, nausea, and vomiting—all symptoms of impending kidney failure. You will probably be producing very small amounts of urine. You may urinate less frequently during the day and wake up at night to urinate. Fluid may accumulate in your body tissues, causing a condition called edema, which makes your skin, particularly around the ankles, look puffy. You may notice swelling around your eyes in the morning. If fluid accumulates in your chest, you may become short of breath.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have symptoms of glomerulonephritis, your doctor will order a urine test to check for protein and red blood cells. If the test results indicate that you could have glomerulonephritis, the doctor will probably order additional tests, such as blood tests, an ultrasound (see page 111) or a CT scan (see page 112), or a kidney biopsy, in which a small sample of kidney cells is removed through a hollow needle and examined under a microscope.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nMany forms of glomerulonephritis require no treatment other than rest. Other forms of the disease can be treated with corticosteroids or immune-suppressing drugs to relieve inflammation or dampen the errant immune response.

Your doctor will probably recommend that you stay in the hospital for several days to allow him or her to monitor your pulse, blood pressure, and blood count, and to check your urine frequently for signs of severe internal bleeding.\n\nSurgery to repair a damaged ureter is usually performed immediately. If your kidney does not heal on its own after a period of bed rest, the doctor may perform surgery to remove it. The remaining healthy kidney may increase in size and level of function and do the work of both kidneys.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > ***Treatment*** > **Injury to the Bladder or the Urethra**]\nBecause the bladder is low inside the pelvis, it is usually protected from injury. When an injury does occur, it generally results from a direct blow to the pelvis that fractures a pelvic bone and causes a sharp fragment of the bone to pierce the bladder wall, or from a direct, forceful blow to a full bladder that causes the bladder to rupture. The bladder can occasionally be damaged during abdominal surgical procedures such as a cesarean section (see page 534) or laparoscopy. These injuries can be serious if urine leaks from the bladder into the abdominal cavity.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > ***Treatment*** > **Injury to the Bladder or the Urethra** > **Location of the bladder**]\nThe bladder is a hollow organ that serves as the temporary storage site for urine. It lies behind the pubic bone and is protected by the circle of bones that form the pelvis.\n\n![Diagram showing a sagittal view of the human pelvis and lower abdomen. The label 'Pelvis' points to the bony structure surrounding the bladder. The label 'Full bladder' points to the enlarged bladder area.]()![](_page_1486_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nBecause the male urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body) is longer than the female urethra, rupture of the urethra occurs more frequently in men than in women. A ruptured urethra can result from a fall or any other kind of serious injury to the pelvis. This type of injury usually occurs in a motor vehicle collision that fractures the pelvis.\n\nRupture of the bladder is dangerous because urine can leak into the abdominal cavity and cause peritonitis (see page 759). This condition requires prompt treatment in a hospital. Damage to the urethra, however, usually does not lead to peritonitis. For a man, the major risks of damage to the urethra are narrowing of the urethra from scarring or inflammation (urethral stricture; see page 837) and erection problems (see page 486).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > ***Treatment*** > *Symptoms*]\nA ruptured bladder causes severe abdominal pain. The condition also may produce symptoms of peritonitis—such as fever, bloating, or nausea and vomiting—and of shock (see page 579)—such as sweating, faintness, shallow breathing, rapid pulse, or pale, cold, clammy skin. A ruptured bladder usually results in the inability to urinate. An injury to the urethra causes extreme pain and an inability to urinate. In some cases, a person has a bloody discharge from the urethra.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > ***Treatment*** > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have an injury to the bladder, urethra, lower abdomen, or urinary tract, see your doctor immediately. He or she may order X-rays of your abdomen and bladder, a CT scan (see page 112) to examine the abdomen and pelvis, and cystoscopy (see page 805) to examine the bladder.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Treatment]\nIf you have an injury to your bladder or urethra, you will be hospitalized and probably given antibiotics to prevent infection. If your bladder is ruptured but urine does not leak into the abdominal cavity, you may need to have a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) placed inside the bladder to allow urine to drain from your body and to prevent urine from leaking into your abdomen. Use of the catheter allows the rupture to heal while preventing the bladder from filling with urine and stretching. If urine leaks from the bladder into the abdominal cavity, the doctor will perform surgery to drain the leaking urine and, if possible, repair the injured bladder. If the urethra is damaged, the doctor will probably insert a catheter into the bladder through the abdominal wall for several days to drain urine. Although the urethra usually heals on its own, surgery is performed occasionally to repair an injured urethra that has not healed within 3 to 6 months.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Treatment > Urinary catheter]\nA urinary catheter is a long, flexible tube that is inserted through the urethra into the bladder to allow urine to drain from the body.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the urinary system.

The age at which symptoms first appear varies from person to person, but most people begin to notice signs of the disease between ages 30 and 40. Common symptoms include pain in the back and in the sides between the ribs and hips, headaches, blood in the urine, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and an enlarged abdomen. High blood pressure is common.\n\nThe disorder can affect the entire body, causing liver, pancreas, and intestinal problems. It can also weaken blood vessels, producing an aneurysm (a balloonlike swelling) that can rupture in a blood vessel of the abdomen or brain. Blood vessels in the walls of the intestine or abdomen can also be affected, producing a hernia (see page 762). One quarter of people with polycystic kidney disease have an abnormality in a heart valve, called mitral valve prolapse (see page 591), that causes a fluttering feeling or pounding in the chest, along with possible chest pain. Cysts can also form in the ovaries, testicles, pancreas, spleen, central nervous system, and liver. By age 60 the disease advances to kidney failure in more than half of all affected people. The risk of kidney failure increases in people who have high blood pressure or blood or protein in their urine.\n\nInfants and children who have the rare recessive form of polycystic kidney disease have the above symptoms along with high blood pressure and frequent urinary tract infections. They usually develop kidney failure within a few years of birth; in rare, severe cases, a baby dies within a few hours or days of birth. Children who live into adolescence or early adulthood are small for their age because the abnormal kidney function inhibits growth.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nDoctors use ultrasound imaging (see page 111), along with a family health history (see page 130), to diagnose both forms of inherited polycystic kidney disease. Kidney cysts are usually clearly visible on an ultrasound. Sometimes doctors detect the first signs of the disorder when an affected adult discovers blood in his or her urine or during a routine examination when high blood pressure is detected. Scientists are working on\n\ndeveloping a genetic test (see page 953) that can screen for polycystic kidney disease before cysts begin to develop.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nCurrently there is no cure for polycystic kidney disease, but treatment of the symptoms can relieve pain and prolong life. Over-the-counter pain medication may help reduce back or headache pain. Severe pain may require surgery to drain and remove the cysts that are causing the pain, but surgery cannot prevent the disease from getting worse. Doctors prescribe antibiotics to treat the frequent urinary tract infections that develop. High blood pressure can be controlled with medication, diet, and exercise. Eventually, if the kidneys fail, the person must begin dialysis or have a kidney transplant (see page 820).\n\nKidney transplantation is a relatively common and successful treatment for kidney failure caused by polycystic kidney disease. Healthy transplanted kidneys do not develop cysts, and donor kidneys are slightly more available than other organs because a person can donate one of his or her kidneys to an affected person and still function normally with the remaining kidney.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Kidney Tumors**]\nA tumor is an abnormal mass of tissue that forms when cells reproduce at an increased rate. There are two major types of kidney tumors, both of which are cancerous. One type, called renal cell carcinoma, occurs only in adults. The other type, called Wil'm's tumor (see page 430), affects mainly children.\n\nRenal cell carcinoma occurs most often in men over age 40. Renal cell carcinomas are highly malignant tumors whose cells can enter the bloodstream and spread to other parts of the body, particularly the lungs or bones. Because these tumors can grow for years without causing symptoms, they may go undetected until they are at an advanced stage. As the tumor enlarges, it can grow into healthy kidney tissue, gradually diminishing the ability of the kidney to filter blood.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nA kidney tumor often causes symptoms such as pain in the side, loss of appetite, weight loss, anemia (see page 610), or blood in the urine, and can cause a variety of symptoms throughout the body.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > **Kidney tumor**]\nA kidney tumor can grow for many years without causing symptoms.

Tumors in the lining of the bladder are often removed with instruments passed through a cystoscope. At some stages of bladder cancer, a doctor may insert a catheter through the urethra into the bladder to deliver a solution containing anticancer medications or an immune system stimulator, such as tuberculosis vaccine. You will be asked to hold the solution in the bladder for 1 or 2 hours before urinating. The medication causes the bladder to shed its\n\nlining, which is then replaced by healthy cells. Although these treatments may effectively destroy the tumor and prevent its recurrence, the doctor will recommend regular checkups to monitor the condition.\n\nIf a tumor has affected a large area of the bladder, or if it has grown into nearby tissue, the doctor may recommend surgical removal of part, or all, of the bladder. After removing the bladder, the surgeon may connect the ureters to a portion of the intestine that he or she has formed into a pouch. The surgeon then attaches the pouch to the urethra, creating a new bladder, which allows you to urinate normally. Alternatively, the surgeon may attach the ureters to a disconnected section of the small intestine, the end of which is sewn to an opening in the skin; urine flows through the opening into a removable external pouch, which you must empty from time to time. After surgery, the doctor may prescribe chemotherapy to destroy any remaining abnormal cells.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Kidney Stones]\nA kidney stone usually begins as a tiny speck of solid material deposited in the renal pelvis, the tissues in the kidney where urine collects before flowing into the ureter (the tube that connects the kidney and the bladder). As additional material adheres to the first speck, it gradually increases in size. This process can occur in one or both kidneys. Over time, a stone that is 1 inch or more in diameter can develop. Most kidney stones contain calcium. Other substances, such as uric acid or amino acids, can crystallize in the urine and form a stone.\n\nTiny stones seldom cause problems because they are easily carried in the ureters and urethra and passed in urine. Any stone with a diameter of about 1/5 inch or more, however, can cause severe pain if it enters the ureter. Passage of a kidney stone is a frequent cause of brief hospital admissions for pain control and administration of fluids.\n\nKidney stones run in families. Men are more susceptible to developing kidney stones than women, and the risk increases after age 30. Kidney stones occur more frequently in people who live in hot climates because of increased loss of body water in very warm weather. Also, unless their fluid intake is substantial, people in hot climates produce a smaller, more concentrated volume of urine, which contains a higher proportion of stone-forming material. In rare cases, children develop a type of kidney stone caused by a chemical abnormality in the blood.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Kidney Stones > Kidney stone]\nA kidney stone is a hardened accumulation of mineral salts or other substances that forms in a kidney. A stone that is smaller than 1/5 inch in diameter can usually pass\n\nthrough a ureter and urethra without difficulty. However, a larger stone can become lodged in the ureter, blocking the flow of urine and causing severe pain.\n\n![Diagram of a kidney cross-section showing the Kidney, Kidney stone, and Ureter.]()![](_page_1496_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nMost kidney stones are eventually passed in the urine. An occasional stone may get stuck in a ureter and block the flow of urine on one side; surgery may be required to remove the stone because of the risk of severe kidney infection and kidney damage.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Symptoms**]\nIf a kidney stone is too large to pass from the kidney into the ureter, it may not cause any symptoms or may cause only occasional pain as small pieces break off and are carried down the ureter. The most common symptom of a kidney stone is renal colic, a severe, stabbing pain that tends to come in waves, often a few minutes apart. Renal colic can develop when a stone passes from a kidney down one of the ureters, blocking the flow of urine. The pain will subside if the stone moves into the bladder. The pain usually occurs on one side of the body, but if you have stones in both kidneys, a subsequent attack of pain can occur on the other side.\n\nPain from a kidney stone usually occurs first in the back, just below the ribs on one side of the spinal column. Over the next few hours or days, the pain may follow the course of the stone as it travels through the ureter—from the back around to the front of the body and down toward the groin. In men, the pain may radiate to the testicles; in women, the pain may radiate to the labia. You may feel nauseated, and notice traces of blood in your urine. After the stone reaches the bladder, it usually passes more easily th", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "anticancer", "relation": "treats", "tail": "bladder cancer"}, {"head": "medications", "relation": "deliver", "tail": "solution containing anticancer medications or an immune system stimulator"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "insert", "tail": "[Event: catheter through the urethra into the bladder]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "hold", "tail": "[Event: solution in the bladder for 1 or 2 hours before urinating]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: insertion of catheter]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: delivery of solution containing anticancer medications or an immune system stimulator]"}, {"head": "[Event: holding solution in the bladder for 1 or 2 hours before urinating]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: shedding of bladder lining and replacement by healthy cells]"}]}, "status": "success"}

A machine called a lithotriptor, which is placed against the abdomen, generates a shock wave that passes through the body to the stone, causing it to disintegrate into a powder that passes from the body in urine.\n\n![Diagram illustrating Extracorporeal Lithotripsy.

Stones that form inside the bladder, however, tend to be larger than kidney stones and may remain in the bladder. These stones form when the bladder does not empty properly, such as when the opening into the urethra is obstructed by an enlarged prostate gland (see page 832).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Extracorporeal lithotripsy** > *Symptoms*]\nA bladder stone may cause symptoms such as a frequent urge to urinate, pain when you pass urine, an intermittent stream of urine, or blood in the urine. Often the blood seems to be squeezed out in the last few drops of urine.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Extracorporeal lithotripsy** > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have symptoms of a bladder stone, your doctor will examine you and order a urine test to check for bacteria and white blood cells, which are signs of infection. He or she may also order an abdominal X-ray (see page 109), a CT scan (see page 112), or an ultrasound scan (see page 111) to examine your bladder.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Extracorporeal lithotripsy** > *Treatment*]\nIf you have bladder stones that are too large to pass naturally through the urethra, the doctor must remove them. This is usually performed by passing a cystoscope (viewing tube) up the urethra into the bladder. The stones are then either crushed and removed, or they are removed in one piece through the cystoscope. To crush the stones, a doctor may use a laser (a highly concentrated beam of light) or an ultrasonic probe passed through a cystoscope, or shock waves in a technique called extracorporeal lithotripsy (see illustration at left). In some cases, very large stones may need to be removed with surgery in which the bladder is opened. After the stone is removed, the doctor will try to find the cause of the stone and recommend treatment to prevent additional stones from forming.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Kidney Failure**]\nKidney failure, also called renal failure, occurs in one of three forms: acute, chronic, or end stage. Acute kidney failure is a condition in which the kidneys suddenly stop functioning, sometimes within a few days or even hours. Acute kidney failure is often reversible. Chronic kidney failure develops undetected over many years and can ultimately lead to end-stage kidney failure. In end-stage kidney failure, the kidneys are severely damaged and can no longer function properly.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Kidney Failure** > **Acute Kidney Failure**]\nIf a person's kidneys suddenly stop functioning, it is usually for one of three reasons: exposure to toxic agents, an immune reaction to a drug, or the result of an infection or disease that affects the kidneys, such as acute glomerulonephritis (see page 807). A\n\nsudden drop in blood pressure from a serious burn, severe bleeding, or a major heart attack can deprive the kidneys of an adequate supply of oxygen-rich blood, damaging them. The flow of urine may be suddenly and completely obstructed by a blockage in the urinary tract, such as in the urethra from an enlarged prostate gland (see page 832) or from a crushing injury in which myoglobin (the oxygen-carrying pigment of muscle) filters through the network of tiny blood vessels inside the kidneys and blocks the kidney's microscopic filtering tubes.\n\nIf the kidneys cannot produce urine, waste products build up in the bloodstream, and water accumulates in the body. A dangerous imbalance of essential body chemicals that are normally regulated by the kidneys may develop.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nIn acute kidney failure, you may pass significantly less urine than usual, possibly less than a cup a day. Almost immediately, you will lose your appetite, feel increasingly nauseated, and begin to vomit. Delaying treatment can lead to drowsiness, confusion, seizures, coma, and death.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nAcute kidney failure is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment in a hospital.

People\n\nwho take several analgesic pills every day for several years are at risk of developing analgesic nephropathy. Analgesics most likely to cause the problem are nonprescription combination medications that mix several pain-relieving ingredients in a single tablet—such as aspirin and acetaminophen combined with caffeine or codeine. To help avoid this potentially serious condition, tell your doctor about any pain-relief medication you are using, especially combination drugs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nSymptoms of chronic kidney failure develop gradually. At first you may notice that you are urinating less often than usual, because your kidneys are not functioning efficiently. If you are urinating less often during the day, you may awaken at night to urinate. You may also feel increasingly tired and lethargic. If chronic kidney failure continues to get worse, it will produce symptoms of end-stage kidney failure (see right).\n\nIf your doctor suspects that you have chronic kidney failure, he or she may order blood and urine tests to measure the levels of electrolytes (essential minerals that help regulate various body processes) and to evaluate kidney function.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf you have chronic kidney failure, your doctor will probably recommend eating a low-protein diet to avoid overworking the kidneys. If you develop high blood pressure, the doctor may ask you to exercise regularly and cut back on salt to help lower your blood pressure. You may also be asked to monitor your fluid intake and urine output. Your doctor will probably recommend that you exercise regularly. Do not take any over-the-counter or prescription medications unless your doctor has prescribed them, to avoid potentially dangerous side effects.\n\nYour doctor may prescribe medications to control your blood pressure and prevent bone damage. He or she may also prescribe medications to lower the pressure inside the filters of the kidneys, or to treat anemia (see page 610) or an underlying disease. With regular checkups, a carefully planned diet, and medication, most people with chronic kidney failure can lead active, productive lives.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > End-Stage Kidney Failure]\nEnd-stage kidney failure is the most advanced form of kidney failure, usually occurring when chronic kidney failure (see page 817) or acute kidney failure (see page 817) progresses to a point at which the kidneys can no longer function. An infection such as pneumonia, which places added stress on the already limited filtering capacity of the kidneys, can tip the balance from chronic kidney failure to end-stage kidney failure.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > End-Stage Kidney Failure > *Symptoms*]\nA variety of symptoms can occur in end-stage kidney failure, including lethargy, weakness, headache, confusion, delirium, and seizures. A person may also have fluid buildup around the heart, an irregular heartbeat, or fluid buildup in the lungs (producing shortness of breath) or just under the skin (producing generalized swelling). The condition can also cause oral thrush (see page 744); nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; pain in the chest or bones; or intensely itchy skin. Severe anemia (see page 610) results from kidney failure, because the kidneys stop producing erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells (which deliver oxygen to other cells throughout the body). In both men and women, the sex hormones and sexual function are affected. A woman with end-stage kidney failure may stop menstruating.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > End-Stage Kidney Failure > *Diagnosis*]\nDoctors diagnose end-stage kidney failure by the symptoms and the results of urine and blood tests. Your doctor will probably ask you to immediately report any illness or any change in your condition.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > End-Stage Kidney Failure > *Treatment*]\nMost people who develop end-stage kidney failure are already receiving treatment for acute or chronic kidney failure. Treatment for end-stage kidney failure is a complex team effort to tailor the various aspects of the treatment program to each patient's needs.\n\nBecause the kidney damage is irreversible, the only effective treatment for most people is either dialysis (see page 818) or a kidney transplant (see below). However, some people with end-stage kidney failure may be too ill for either treatment. Doctors\n\ntreat anemia with regular injections of erythropoietin and prescribe other medications as needed to relieve specific symptoms.\n\nDialysis and kidney transplantation have significantly improved the chances of survival for people who have end-stage kidney failure.

Each of the two testicles is suspended by a spermatic cord inside a pouch of skin and muscle called the scrotum. The spermatic cord is made up of the vas deferens, nerves, and blood vessels. The testicles produce sperm and the male sex hormone testosterone. Sperm are collected and stored in a long, tightly coiled tube called the epididymis, which lies above and behind each testicle. Sperm mature over a period of about 3 weeks inside the epididymis before they pass into the vas deferens, a long duct that acts as a storage and transport system. Sperm travel from the vas deferens, past the prostate gland, into a pair of sacs called the seminal vesicles.\n\n**The male reproductive system** The visible parts of the male reproductive system are the penis and scrotum, the pouch of skin and muscle that protects the two testicles. When a male is sexually aroused, spongy tissue inside the penis fills with blood. The testicles produce sperm and the male sex hormone testosterone. From the testicles, sperm travel through a duct called the vas deferens into a pair of sacs called the seminal vesicles. The prostate gland, Cowper's glands (not shown), and seminal vesicles produce fluids that are added to sperm to create semen, which is ejaculated during orgasm.\n\n![Diagram of the male reproductive and urinary system showing the Spongy tissue, Bladder, Seminal vesicle, Prostate gland, Spermatic cord, Epididymis, Testicle, Scrotum, Penis, Urethra, and Foreskin.]()![](_page_1512_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nThe prostate gland, Cowper's glands, and seminal vesicles produce fluids that support sperm and make up about 98 percent of semen. When a male is sexually aroused, spongy tissue inside the penis fills with blood, causing the penis to become erect. During an orgasm, semen is ejaculated through the urethra (a muscular tube inside the penis that carries urine and semen out of the body). The muscular action of ejaculation automatically closes the neck of the bladder, temporarily preventing urine from entering the urethra and preventing semen from entering the bladder.\n\nInfections of the reproductive and urinary tracts are rare in men because the length of the urethra usually provides an effective barrier against infectious agents. However, because the organs of the reproductive system are connected to the organs of the urinary tract, a disorder in one system can cause symptoms in the other.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Testicles and Scrotum]\nThe testicles develop inside the abdomen of a male fetus. By the time the baby is born, the testicles have usually descended through the abdominal wall and are suspended inside a pouch of skin and muscle called the scrotum. Each testicle is connected to the body by a single spermatic cord, which is composed of the vas deferens (sperm duct), nerves, and blood vessels.\n\nSperm are collected and stored in the epididymis (a tightly coiled tube that lies above and behind each testicle) until they mature (which takes about 3 weeks). Fully developed sperm pass into the vas deferens, where they are stored. During orgasm, sperm travel from the vas deferens to the seminal vesicles, where they mix with fluids produced by the prostate gland, Cowper's glands, and seminal vesicles to form semen. Semen is ejaculated from the body through the urethra. Sperm that are not ejaculated in semen during orgasm gradually break down and are reabsorbed by the body.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Testicles and Scrotum > Cross section of a testicle and scrotum]\n![Diagram showing a cross-section of a testicle and scrotum.

Although testicular cancer accounts for only about 1 percent of all cancers in men, it is the most common form of cancer in men between ages 18 and 35. In the United States, 6,000 to 8,000 cases of testicular cancer are diagnosed each year. Cancer of the testicle occurs more often in whites than in people of other races. Advances in the development of new drugs and diagnostic tests have significantly increased the survival rates of people with testicular cancer. With early diagnosis and treatment, cancer of the testicle is frequently curable.\n\nThe two different types of testicular cancer are seminomas (which account for about 35 to 40 percent of cases) and nonseminomas (which account for about 60 percent of cases). Seminomas consist of a single type of immature germ cell that probably arises\n\nfrom the cells that produce sperm.

Because seminomas tend to grow slowly and usually do not spread, they usually are diagnosed in stage I or II. If performed early enough, removal of the entire affected testicle may be the only treatment necessary for a seminoma. However, treatment for seminomas usually combines testicle removal, radiation therapy (see page 23), and chemotherapy. Surgical removal of lymph nodes usually is not necessary for men who have seminomas because this type of tumor responds well to radiation treatment. Doctors usually treat stage III seminomas with multidrug chemotherapy and radiation.\n\nAlthough nonseminomas grow more rapidly than seminomas and often spread before they are detected, the cure rate is high. Because nonseminomas do not respond as well to radiation therapy, surgical removal of the lymph nodes is often necessary after the cancer has spread beyond the testicle. Treatment of nonseminomas also can include multidrug chemotherapy. Men who have a stage II nonseminoma who have had surgery to remove the affected testicle and lymph nodes may need no further treatment. However, some doctors recommend a short course of multidrug chemotherapy to reduce the risk of recurrence. Most stage III nonseminomas can be treated effectively with chemotherapy.\n\nThe condition of men who have been treated for cancer of the testicle is carefully monitored for at least 2 years after treatment to make sure the cancer has not recurred. The disease recurs in about 10 to 15 percent of men who have been treated for stage I testicular cancer. If the cancer recurs, it is treated with chemotherapy.\n\nAfter a man has been cancer-free for 3 years, cancer of the testicle seldom recurs. Men who have been treated for cancer in one testicle have about a 1 percent chance of developing cancer in the remaining testicle. If cancer develops in the second testicle, it is usually a new tumor rather than the result of cancer cells that have spread from the first tumor. After treatment for testicular cancer, men should continue to perform monthly testicle self-examinations.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Torsion of the Testicle]\nEach testicle is suspended in the scrotum by a spermatic cord that consists of the vas deferens, nerves, and blood vessels. In torsion of the testicle, one of the testicles becomes twisted on the spermatic cord, cutting off blood flow to and from the testicle. The condition is rare, and the cause is usually unknown. Although testicular torsion develops most often during adolescence, it can occur at any age.\n\nIn some cases of testicular torsion, the testicle untwists by itself. However, if the testicle does not return to its usual position naturally, and the condition is not treated within 4 to 8 hours, the sperm-producing parts of the testicle or the entire testicle can be permanently damaged, and the tissue may die (gangrene; see page 601). For this reason, torsion of the testicle is a medical emergency.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Torsion of the Testicle > Torsion of the testicle]\nEach testicle is suspended in the scrotum by a spermatic cord.

Even if the problem seems to have cleared up on its own, it is important to see your doctor right away to rule out other possible problems.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Torsion of the Testicle > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nThe main symptom of testicular torsion is sudden, severe pain in the groin area. One side of the scrotum is swollen and can be red and tender, and the affected testicle may rest higher than usual or may lie horizontally in the scrotum. Other possible symptoms include fever, light-headedness, fainting, and nausea and vomiting. A diagnosis of testicular torsion is based on the symptoms and a physical examination, including an examination of the testicles.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Torsion of the Testicle > WARNING! > Testicle Strangulation]\nIf the spermatic cord becomes twisted, blood flow to and from the testicle can be blocked.

He or she may also recommend bed rest, ice packs applied to the scrotum, elevation and support of the scrotum, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen to relieve pain and inflammation. Rarely, in severe or chronic cases, a doctor may recommend surgery to remove the infected epididymis.\n\nIf your epididymitis was caused by a sexually transmitted disease, it may also be necessary to treat your sex partner to avoid reinfection and reduce the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (see page 871) in your female partner.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Orchitis**]\nOrchitis is inflammation of one or both testicles that usually results from the viral infection mumps (see page 440) but also can result from an injury or a bacterial infection in the prostate gland or epididymis. This rare condition can permanently damage one or both testicles and, in some cases, can result in infertility.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nOrchitis causes pain, swelling, and a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum. You also may have a fever and nausea. In some cases, symptoms include discharge from the penis, pain during urination, pain during sexual intercourse or ejaculation, or blood in the semen.\n\nTo diagnose orchitis, a doctor will perform a manual examination of the affected testicle and will probably recommend an ultrasound scan (see page 111) of the scrotum. He or she will order blood and urine tests to help determine the cause of the infection.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIn many cases, orchitis can be treated successfully by limiting activity, placing an ice pack on the affected testicle, and wearing an athletic supporter. For pain, doctors usually recommend over-the-counter pain relievers. If orchitis results from a bacterial infection, a doctor will prescribe an antibiotic or an antibacterial drug.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Hypogonadism]\nHypogonadism, or testosterone deficiency, is a disorder in which the testicles fail to produce the male sex hormone testosterone, which stimulates sexual development. There are two main types of hypogonadism: primary and secondary. Primary hypogonadism, also known as primary testicular failure, arises from an abnormality in the testicles. Secondary hypogonadism signals a defect in the pituitary gland, a small structure at the base of the brain that secretes a variety of different hormones, which regulate many processes in the body.\n\nWhen the pituitary gland does not send hormones to the testicles, the testicles cannot produce testosterone. Hypogonadism affects about 1 in 500 men and boys.\n\nPrimary hypogonadism can be caused by a number of factors, including:\n\n- A genetic disorder such as Klinefelter syndrome (see page 957), in which an extra X chromosome causes abnormal testicle development\n- Absence of testicles at birth\n- Undescended testicles\n- Hemochromatosis (see page 961), an inherited disorder that causes iron to build up in the blood\n- Injury to the testicles\n- Hernia surgery\n- Chemotherapy or radiation therapy for cancer\n- Inflammatory diseases such as sarcoidosis (see page 929)\n- Mumps contracted during adolescence or in adulthood\n- Normal aging\n\nThe possible causes of secondary hypogonadism include disorders that affect the functioning of the pituitary gland, severe head injury, or taking some medications.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Hypogonadism > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms produced by hypogonadism vary depending on the age at which the disorder occurs. If it occurs during fetal development, too little testosterone is produced, resulting in a condition in which the infant's genitals are not fully developed and his or her gender cannot be determined. During puberty, hypogonadism can cause such symptoms as slowed growth, underdeveloped muscle mass, small penis and testicles, and scant growth of body hair. Other signs during puberty include breast enlargement, disproportionately long arms and legs, and failure of the voice to deepen.\n\nMen who develop hypogonadism can have scant beard and body hair growth, testicles that are smaller or less firm than normal, and enlarged breasts. They may also have increased body fat and decreased muscle mass and bone density, erection problems, and infertility from an inability to produce sperm. The lowered testosterone levels can also produce symptoms similar to those of menopause in women, including hot flashes, a reduced sex drive, and mood swings.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf your son has signs of hypogonadism, take him to a doctor for an evaluation because early detection can prevent delayed puberty (see page 449).

A spermatocele may light up under a strong light source in a darkened room. To confirm the diagnosis, the doctor will order an ultrasound scan (see page 111) of the scrotum or a biopsy (in which a sample of cells is removed from the mass and examined under a microscope).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > ***Treatment***]\nIf an accumulation of fluid in the scrotum is not growing and is not causing discomfort, treatment may not be necessary.

If you have a varicocele and are having problems with fertility, your doctor will perform surgery to remove the varicose veins from the spermatic cord. All types of fluid accumulation in the scrotum can recur after surgery.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Prostate Gland]\nThe prostate gland is a collection of small glands; it weighs about an ounce and is about the size of a walnut. It is covered with a layer of muscle and fibrous tissue called the prostatic capsule. The prostate sits directly below the bladder and in front of the rectum, and surrounds the neck of the bladder and the upper part of the urethra (the muscular tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body).\n\nThe main function of the prostate gland is to produce part of the seminal fluid, the fluid that supports sperm in the semen. During orgasm, fluid from the prostate is squeezed into the urethra as sperm and other substances enter the urethra from the seminal vesicles and vas deferens. When combined, these substances form semen, which carries sperm through the urethra and out of the penis during ejaculation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Prostate Gland > Healthy prostate gland]\n![Diagram illustrating the healthy prostate gland and surrounding structures. Labeled parts include: Vas deferens, Ureter, Bladder, Seminal vesicle, Prostate gland, and Urethra.]()![](_page_1525_Picture_6.jpeg)\n\nAfter age 40, men are more prone to two types of prostate disorders—an enlarged prostate and cancer. Because the prostate gland surrounds the urethra, nearly all disorders of the prostate gland cause symptoms related to urination, such as a weak or interrupted urinary stream or a frequent or urgent need to urinate. The three most common prostate problems are inflammation (prostatitis), enlargement (benign prostatic hyperplasia), and prostate cancer.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Prostatitis]\nProstatitis is inflammation of the prostate gland. The three basic forms of prostatitis are bacterial prostatitis, nonbacterial prostatitis (also called chronic pelvic pain syndrome), and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis. Prostatitis can occur with or without an infection.\n\nThe two types of bacterial prostatitis (also called infectious prostatitis) are acute bacterial prostatitis and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Acute bacterial prostatitis is a rare but serious disease caused by bacteria in the prostate gland. The bacteria may have come from an infection elsewhere in the body. Chronic bacterial prostatitis occurs primarily in older men who have an enlarged prostate (see next page). It is a recurring infection of the prostate gland that usually results from previous bacterial infections that were not eliminated completely.\n\nNonbacterial prostatitis is the most common but least understood form of the condition. It may be inflammatory or noninflammatory. In the inflammatory form, there is no evidence of an infecting microorganism but infection-fighting cells are present. In the noninflammatory form, there is no evidence of either infection or infection-fighting cells.\n\nIn asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis, a man has infection-fighting cells in his semen but has no symptoms. Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis is usually diagnosed when a doctor is testing the prostate for other disorders.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nThe initial symptom of both bacterial and nonbacterial prostatitis is often pain in and around the base of the penis and behind ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "light", "relation": "passes through", "tail": "hydrocele"}, {"head": "light", "relation": "does not pass through", "tail": "hematoccele"}, {"head": "light", "relation": "does not pass through", "tail": "varicocele"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "performs", "tail": "[Event: physical examination]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "orders", "tail": "[Event: ultrasound scan]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "orders", "tail": "[Event: biopsy]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: physical examination]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: diagnosis]"}, {"head": "[Event: ultrasound scan]", "relation": "confirms", "tail": "[Event: diagnosis]"}, {"head": "[Event: biopsy]", "relation": "confirms", "tail": "[Event: diagnosis]"}]}, "status": "success"}

As the prostate becomes larger, it can tighten around the urethra and block the flow of urine. Starting urination is difficult, and the urine stream is weak. The blockage may cause the bladder muscles to enlarge and the bladder to become irritable, causing contractions of the bladder that result in a frequent urge to urinate. Eventually the muscles are no longer able to force urine past the blockage, causing the urine to back up. This backup of urine can result in damage to the bladder muscles, frequent urinary tract infections, and urinary retention (the inability to urinate). BPH usually does not affect sexual function, although the flow of semen may be blocked. Without treatment, late stages of BPH can lead to kidney damage or kidney failure.\n\nBy age 50, more than half of all American men have signs of prostate enlargement. Although doctors are not sure what causes BPH, they know that it is linked to the male sex hormone testosterone and aging. (BPH does not occur in men whose testicles were surgically removed before puberty or in men whose testicles cannot produce testosterone.)\n\nA diet high in fat and cholesterol may be a risk factor for BPH. Obesity is also a risk factor—men who have a waist size larger than 43 inches are twice as likely to develop BPH than are men who have a waist size of 35 inches or smaller. The risk increases with age.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of BPH can result from either irritation or obstruction in the urinary tract. Symptoms of irritation are related to the bladder muscle and include a frequent need to urinate, numerous trips to the bathroom at night, and urgency (a strong urge to urinate). These symptoms are usually the first signs of a prostate problem, although they are often not noticeable until years after the prostate has begun to enlarge; they can also be a sign of other urinary tract disorders.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > **Enlarged prostate gland**]\nAn enlarged prostate can obstruct the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body), reducing the flow of urine and causing the muscular wall of the bladder to thicken as it works harder to force urine out of the body.\n\n![Diagram illustrating a cross-section of the male urinary system showing bladder outlet obstruction. Key structures labeled include: Vas deferens, Ureter, Thickened bladder wall, Seminal vesicle, Enlarged prostate, and Urethra.]()![](_page_1530_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nBladder outlet obstruction is a group of symptoms associated with BPH and related to problems with urine flow. These symptoms include decreased force and diameter of the urinary stream, inability to urinate, trouble starting the flow of urine, a weak flow of urine, double voiding (a person urinates and is able to urinate again in 5 to 10 minutes), dribbling after urination, and overflow urinary incontinence (leaking of urine from an overfull bladder). Frequent urinary tract infections, characterized by a burning sensation during urination, strong-smelling urine, and some blood in the urine, may also result from BPH. Bladder outlet obstruction tends to come and go.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose BPH, a doctor takes a health history and performs a physical examination, including a urinalysis, to rule out infection. He or she may try to feel the bladder (which normally cannot be felt) by pressing down on the abdomen above the pelvic bone. The doctor also performs a digital rectal examination (by inserting a gloved, lubricated finger in the rectum) to feel the prostate and determine if and how much it is enlarged. He or she may recommend a test that uses a device called a uroflometer that measures the rate at which urine flows, to determine if the flow of urine from the bladder is obstructed. He or she may also perform an ultrasonic postvoid residual (PVR) urine test, a noninvasive test that measures the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination.\n\nBlood tests may be recommended to rule out kidney disease or to screen for prostate cancer (see page 835). A procedure called cystoscopy (examination of the urinary tract\n\nwith a viewing tube) may be done to evaluate the urinary tract and determine the extent of obstruction.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nBPH is a normal effect of aging, and therefore cannot be cured. However, the symptoms can be relieved with medication or surgery. If your symptoms are mild, your doctor may recommend a period of watchful waiting. During this time, he or she will carefully monitor your symptoms and try to determine whether external factors—such as consumption of alcohol or caffeine, exercise, or stress—are triggering your symptoms.

Each year in the United States, doctors diagnose about 200,000 new cases of prostate cancer and more than 30,000 men die of the disease. Prostate cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in American men, after lung cancer and colon cancer. The risk of prostate cancer increases significantly after age 50, especially in African American men. Your risk of developing prostate cancer is increased if a close relative (such as your father or brother) has the disease, which indicates a genetic component.\n\nSome prostate cancers grow slowly, and are not detected for several years. Some prostate cancers never threaten health because they develop later in life; many older men who have prostate cancer die of another cause. However, in a significant number of cases, the cancer is more aggressive and grows and spreads rapidly.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Prostate Cancer > Symptoms]\nProstate cancer usually causes no noticeable symptoms in the early stages. In some men, the cancer grows so slowly that it never causes symptoms. Rarely, in the late stages of the disease, symptoms can develop, including weight loss, weakness, decreased\n\nappetite, a weak or interrupted flow of urine, inability to urinate, difficulty starting the flow of urine, and frequent urination (especially at night). Other possible symptoms include blood in the urine, pain or burning during urination, or persistent pain in the lower back, pelvis, or upper thighs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nDoctors usually detect prostate cancer in one of three ways—during a digital rectal examination, from a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test (see right), or during a surgical procedure called transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP; see previous page), performed to treat an enlarged prostate. Annual digital rectal examinations are recommended starting at age 50 for white men who have no family history of prostate cancer, and at age 45 for all African American men and for white men who have a family history of prostate cancer. If you have any symptoms of prostate cancer, see your doctor right away.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The PSA Test]\nThe prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test measures the amount of prostate-specific antigen, a protein that circulates in your bloodstream and is produced mainly by the prostate gland. Normally, very little PSA is in the blood. Elevated PSA levels can be a sign of prostate cancer, but usually indicate other, less serious, prostate problems, such as benign prostatic hypertrophy (see page 832), infection or inflammation of the prostate, or a minor injury, such as bruising caused by a long bike ride. For this reason, additional tests, such as a biopsy (in which a doctor removes a small sample of tissue from the prostate gland for examination under a microscope), are performed to rule out prostate cancer.\n\nDoctors disagree about whether all men should have routine PSA testing after age 50. The PSA test is not designed to diagnose prostate cancer, so some men who have low PSA levels may still have prostate cancer. Conversely, most men who have elevated PSA levels do not have prostate cancer. Uncertain test results can cause anxiety and may lead to unnecessary procedures, such as a biopsy or surgery. Any kind of prostate cancer surgery poses the risk of problems such as urinary incontinence (leaking of urine) or erection problems (see page 486). However, although the PSA test is\n\nimperfect, when combined with a digital rectal examination, many doctors consider it to be dependable for detecting prostate cancer in the early stages, when it is more likely to be curable.\n\nThe American Cancer Society recommends an annual PSA test along with an annual digital rectal examination for all men over age 50, and at age 45 for younger men who have an increased risk of developing the disease—such as African Americans and men whose father or brother has prostate cancer. Talk to your doctor about the PSA test so you can make an informed decision about having the test.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTreatments for prostate cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, cryotherapy, or combinations of these. Your doctor will work with you to develop an appropriate treatment plan based on the benefits, possible side effects, and risks of each treatment; your age; your overall health; your preferences; the likelihood of your living at least 10 more years; and the stage of your cancer. Doctors may recommend watchful waiting for older men whose cancer is at an early stage and is growing slowly. Watchful waiting involves regular digital rectal examinations, a PSA test every 3 to 6 months, and, in some cases, an annual prostate biopsy.\n\nRadical prostatectomy is the most common surgical procedure for prostate cancer.

The urethra is a narrow, muscular tube that carries urine from the\n\nbladder out of the body. In men, the urethra also carries semen out of the body during ejaculation. Ducts leading from the testicles, the seminal vesicles, and the prostate gland join the urethra just below the point where it leaves the bladder.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Bladder, Urethra, and Penis > Location of the bladder, urethra, and penis]\n![Diagram illustrating the location of the bladder, urethra, and penis in the male reproductive system.

The urethra is shown passing through the bladder and prostate gland, and exiting the penis.]()![](_page_1537_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\nMost of the urethra lies inside the penis, which consists of three cylinders. The two cylinders on the upper surface of the penis are made up of spongy tissue that is filled with blood when the penis is erect and empty when the penis is relaxed. The third cylinder surrounds the urethra and does not fill with blood during an erection.\n\nIn uncircumcised men, the head of the penis (called the glans) is covered by a loose flap of skin called the foreskin. In the United States, the foreskin is frequently removed at birth in a surgical procedure called circumcision (see page 375).\n\nDisorders of the bladder and urethra that affect both men and women are discussed in the chapter on disorders of the urinary tract (see page 801). Those included here affect men exclusively or affect men differently than women.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Bladder, Urethra, and Penis > Cystitis in Men]\nCystitis is inflammation of the bladder. Cystitis is rare in men and usually results from a more serious underlying disorder, such as a blockage or tumor in the urinary tract or an infection that has spread from elsewhere in the urinary tract, such as the urethra or the prostate gland.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of cystitis include pressure or pain in the lower abdomen, an itching or burning sensation when urinating, an urgent need to urinate, increased frequency of urination, and reddish or brownish or strong-smelling urine. Other possible symptoms include fatigue, fever, chills, vomiting, pain in the side, or pain in the penis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA preliminary diagnosis of cystitis is based on the symptoms. A doctor will order a urine test to check for bacteria or blood in the urine. The urine sample is grown in the laboratory to confirm the presence of an infection, identify the microorganism that is causing the infection, and determine the best treatment. If there is no infection, the doctor will probably recommend tests—such as cystoscopy (see page 805), an ultrasound (see page 111), or a CT scan (see page 112)—to determine if an underlying disorder is causing the problem.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf the cystitis is caused by a urinary tract infection, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics or antibacterial drugs, depending on the cause of the infection. He or she will also treat any underlying disorder that is causing the problem. Your doctor will probably recommend that you increase your intake of fluids (to at least eight glasses of water every day), while avoiding fluids (such as alcohol, citrus juices such as orange juice, and beverages that contain caffeine) that could irritate your bladder.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Urethral Stricture**]\nUrethral stricture is a condition in which the urethra gradually narrows because of contracting scar tissue in the walls of the urethra. The scarring may result from long-\n\nterm use of a catheter, from surgery, or from chronic inflammation of the urethra caused by an injury or an infection such as gonorrhea (see page 480).\n\nUrethral stricture can interfere with urination and ejaculation. In rare cases, the condition results in kidney damage if urine builds up in the urinary tract and flows backward into the kidneys. Urethral stricture can sometimes be a factor in urinary tract infections.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Urethral Stricture** > **Urethral stricture**]\nInjury or chronic inflammation can cause scar tissue (dark areas) to form in the walls of the urethra and narrow the channel inside the urethra. Narrowing of the channel can block the flow of urine, causing problems in the urinary tract.\n\n![Diagram illustrating a urethral stricture.

The condition is normal before about age 5, but the foreskin naturally loosens by\n\nadolescence. In older men, phimosis can result from persistent irritation and inflammation of the head of the penis, and it can interfere with urination and sexual activity. Doctors think that phimosis may be a factor in cancer of the penis.\n\nA diagnosis of phimosis is based on the symptoms and a physical examination. The condition is usually detected during puberty, when erections cause pain in the penis. If you have phimosis, your doctor will probably recommend circumcision (surgical removal of the foreskin).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > Paraphimosis]\nParaphimosis is the inability to pull a retracted foreskin back over the head of the penis. This condition often results from phimosis. The symptoms include pain and swelling, especially in the head of the penis. Paraphimosis can also cause loss of blood flow to the head of the penis, which is a medical emergency that requires immediate medical treatment. If you cannot pull your foreskin back over the head of your penis, call your doctor right away or go directly to the nearest hospital emergency department. Paraphimosis is usually treated with circumcision (surgical removal of the foreskin).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Peyronie's Disease]\nIn Peyronie's disease, the penis bends or curves during an erection. In this noncancerous, progressive condition, a scar called a plaque develops in the erectile tissue inside the penis after an infection or injury, or for no obvious reason. The scar usually forms in the upper or lower part of the penis, but can form in both. If the plaque does not clear up within a few months, it can develop into permanent scar tissue or calcium deposits that do not allow the spongy tissue of the penis to expand, causing it to bend during an erection.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nIn Peyronie's disease, the penis bends at an angle during an erection, making intercourse painful and sometimes impossible. The curvature may develop slowly or rapidly and can be mild or severe. The condition is usually painful, but the pain sometimes decreases over time. In some men, Peyronie's disease causes erection problems (see page 486).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA doctor can diagnose Peyronie's disease by the symptoms and by a physical examination. The doctor may inject medication into the penis to induce an erection so he or she can evaluate the curvature. Ultrasound (see page 111) of the penis is sometimes performed to locate the plaque that is causing the problem.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe treatment of Peyronie's disease depends on how severe the curvature is and on how long the person has had it. Some treatments can reduce the pain but cannot correct the bend in the penis. Because surgery can cause complications and make the condition worse, doctors usually try other measures first. For example, most doctors recommend treatment with vitamin E supplements to help prevent the plaque from growing. Other treatments include injecting corticosteroids, calcium channel blockers, or other medications into the scar tissue to keep the scar from growing; using an electric current to deliver a drug to the scar tissue to keep the scar from growing; or directing high-energy radiation (using ultrasound guidance) to the affected site to break up the scar.\n\nIn most cases, surgery to correct Peyronie's disease is successful. In one procedure, the surgeon removes the plaque and grafts a patch of skin or other material onto the treated area. In another procedure, tissue on the unaffected side of the penis is removed, which straightens the curve but makes the penis shorter when it is erect. In some cases, inserting an implant into the penis can straighten it. Although these procedures can cure Peyronie's disease, they can also cause further scarring that could make the condition worse or cause erection problems (see page 486).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Priapism**]\nPriapism is a painful, persistent erection that occurs without sexual stimulation. This rare condition can occur when an underlying condition leads to blood vessel or nerve\n\nabnormalities that cause blood to become trapped in the penis. Possible underlying conditions include medications, blood clots, urinary tract infections, sickle cell disease, leukemia, or a tumor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > **Persistent Erection**]\nPriapism is a medical emergency that requires immediate medical treatment. If you have an erection that persists for no reason, call your doctor right away, or go directly to the nearest hospital emergency department.\n\nIf priapism is not treated promptly, the spongy tissues of the penis can be permanently damaged, preventing future erections. The tissue can also die (gangrene; see page 601).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of priapism is bas", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "phimosis", "relation": "result from", "tail": "persistent irritation and inflammation of the head of the penis"}, {"head": "phimosis", "relation": "interfere with", "tail": "urination and sexual activity"}, {"head": "phimosis", "relation": "may be a factor in", "tail": "cancer of the penis"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "think", "tail": "[Event: phimosis may be a factor in cancer of the penis]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "will probably recommend", "tail": "[Event: circumcision]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "have", "tail": "[Event: phimosis]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: persistent irritation and inflammation of the head of the penis]", "relation": "result in", "tail": "[Event: phimosis]"}, {"head": "[Event: phimosis]", "relation": "interfere with", "tail": "[Event: urination and sexual activity]"}]}, "status": "success"}

By recognizing the most common symptoms and talking about them with your doctor, you can often detect these problems in their early stages, when they are easiest to treat. The more information you have, the better you can protect or improve your reproductive health.\n\nYour reproductive system is partly hidden and partly exposed. Your external genitals include the clitoris; the outer and inner labia, or lips; and the opening to your vagina. Together these external genitals are called the vulva. Your internal reproductive organs—the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries—lie inside your body so the processes of conception and pregnancy can be protected. All of the sexual and reproductive functions that these organs fulfill are directed by a system of hormones coordinated by the brain.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Female Reproductive System > The internal female reproductive organs]\nYour reproductive organs are inside your lower abdomen, where the processes of conception and pregnancy can take place in a protected environment. Each month, one of your ovaries releases an egg, which travels through a fallopian tube toward your uterus. If the egg is fertilized by a sperm, it will implant in the lining of the uterus. If unfertilized, it will be shed during menstruation.\n\nDiagram showing the side view of the reproductive organs. Labeled structures include: Fallopian tube, Uterus, Bladder, Pubic bone, Urethra, Vagina, Ovary, Cervix, and Rectum.\n\nSide view of reproductive organs\n\n![](_page_1548_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nDiagram showing the front view of the reproductive organs.

Labeled structures include: Mons pubis, Clitoris, Outer labia, Inner labia, Vaginal opening, Perineum, and Anus.\n\n![](_page_1548_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\nInside your outer and inner labia lies the clitoris, the organ of sexual arousal in women. Just below is the opening to the urethra, from which urine passes out of your body. The vaginal opening is behind the urethral opening and is partially covered by a membrane called the hymen until the first time you have intercourse. The perineum is the skin and underlying muscle between the vagina and the anus.\n\nThe vagina is the entrance to your internal reproductive organs. After intercourse, sperm travel up the vagina, past the cervix, and into the uterus. From the uterus, the sperm make their way up through the fallopian tubes, possibly to fertilize an egg produced by one of your ovaries. Usually, one ovary releases an egg each month. If a\n\nsperm fertilizes an egg, the fertilized egg implants in the uterus, beginning the process of pregnancy. An unfertilized egg is shed during menstruation (see next page).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sex Hormones]\nThe delicately balanced and precisely timed release of the sex hormones controls the female reproductive system. The sex hormones include the following:\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sex Hormones > *Estrogen*]\nProduced mainly in the ovaries, estrogen is the most important female sex hormone. Estrogen is responsible for triggering puberty in girls, including development of secondary sex characteristics such as breasts and pubic hair. The hormone maintains the healthy functioning of the reproductive system throughout life. Estrogen is also produced in small amounts in the testicles in men and in the brain in both men and women.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sex Hormones > *Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH)*]\nFSH and LH are manufactured by the pituitary gland in both men and women. In women, the hormones regulate menstruation by stimulating the release of an egg (ovulation) every month. In men, these hormones coordinate the production of sperm in the testicles.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sex Hormones > *Progesterone*]\nAfter ovulation, the ovaries produce progesterone, which stimulates the lining of the uterus to thicken with blood in preparation for the implantation of a fertilized egg. During pregnancy, the placenta (the organ that links the woman's blood supply to that of the fetus) produces progesterone to maintain a healthy pregnancy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sex Hormones > *Testosterone*]\nTestosterone is the primary male sex hormone, responsible for the development of the secondary sex characteristics in boys at puberty.

A doctor will first do a pregnancy test to determine if that is the cause. If you are not pregnant and are otherwise healthy, your doctor will probably tell you to wait for a few months to see if your periods start again on their own. If you do not have a period for 6 months, your doctor may order diagnostic tests to\n\ncheck for an underlying disorder, such as hypothyroidism (see page 903). The doctor may need to check your hormone levels to make sure you are producing estrogen and that you have not gone into premature menopause.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > *Treatment*]\nIf you are not having periods, your doctor will treat the underlying cause. If you are not producing estrogen, your doctor may prescribe hormone therapy (see page 853). Women who don't have regular periods may have difficulty getting pregnant. If you want to become pregnant, the doctor may prescribe a fertility drug (see page 499) to restart ovulation. Women who have the eating disorder anorexia (see page 726), who are very thin, or who exercise excessively or do vigorous athletic training on a regular basis can have either a delayed onset of menstruation or cessation of their periods (see above). This condition usually indicates that they are not consuming enough calories to maintain a normal weight or proportion of body fat, which reduces estrogen production.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Female Athlete Triad]\nThe benefits of physical activity almost always outweigh the risks. But some women who train intensively for athletic competition and do not consume enough calories to compensate for their increased activity level risk developing a condition known as the female athlete triad. This disorder is a cluster of three conditions—eating disorders (see page 724), lack of periods, and the bone-thinning disorder osteoporosis (see page 989)—that can occur together in women who engage in intense athletic exercise or training.\n\nThe prevalence of the female athlete triad is difficult to assess because many women with an eating disorder are secretive about their eating habits. Among the contributing factors are pressure by coaches and parents to win at all costs, frequent weigh-ins that penalize athletes for weight gain, and society's preference for a thin body. The girls and women most at risk of developing the condition are those in activities such as gymnastics, figure skating, distance running, ballet, and swimming.\n\nThe female athlete triad can place you at risk for some potentially serious health problems. The lack of periods indicates inadequate production of the female sex hormone estrogen, which is essential for maintaining bone strength. If you miss your period for more than 4 months, you will begin to\n\nlose bone mass, which can lead to frequent stress fractures and osteoporosis. Failing to keep your body weight at a normal level can have adverse effects on your heart, hormone system, and digestive system.\n\nIn addition to the lack of periods, common symptoms of the female athlete triad include:\n\n- Fatigue\n- Anemia\n- Depression and other psychological problems\n- Stress fractures\n- Inability to concentrate\n- Intolerance to cold; having cold hands and feet\n- Constipation\n- Dry skin\n- Light-headedness\n- Slow pulse\n- Low blood pressure\n- Downy hair growth on the face and body\n\nHaving your periods stop is not a normal consequence of intense training. It is a sign that your body is not getting enough nourishment and, to help protect you from starving, your body has shut down your reproductive system. If you exercise vigorously on a regular basis and your periods have stopped, see your doctor so you can prevent further bone loss. He or she will encourage you to gradually gain some weight and cut back on your training, enough to restart your periods. Your doctor may also prescribe estrogen replacement therapy (possibly in the form of birth-control pills; see page 470), which may help forestall bone loss until your body weight returns to normal.\n\nIf you have amenorrhea, remember that an egg can be released from an ovary at any time, so if you want to prevent pregnancy, you must still use some form of contraception throughout your menstrual cycle.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Female Athlete Triad > Irregular Periods]\nA woman's periods are considered irregular when 35 or more days (at least 7 more than the usual 28) pass from the first day of one cycle to the first day of the next.\n\nVariations in the regularity of menstruation can result from stress, a change in contraceptive method, or taking medications such as corticosteroids. Menstruation depends on a balance of estrogen and progesterone (the two main female sex hormones). When this balance is disturbed, irregular periods can result.

If your period is late as well as heavy, you may be having an early miscarriage. In this case, see your doctor immediately. Your doctor will ask you questions and examine you to find out the extent of bleeding and to see whether there could be an abnormality in your uterus. The doctor may do a Pap smear (see page 140) to check for cancer of the cervix, and an endometrial biopsy (see below) to screen for cancer of the uterus. A blood test will help determine if the heavy bleeding has caused anemia and will identify any other blood or hormone problems that could be contributing to your heavy periods.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf you have a single heavy period and do not think you are pregnant, reduce your activity, drink extra fluids, and take an iron supplement. If you have consistently heavy periods and tests do not find the cause, your doctor may prescribe a medication that contains the hormone progesterone (or estrogen combined with progesterone) to reduce the bleeding. These are the same hormones contained in oral contraceptives. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs sometimes help reduce the bleeding. If you are using a copper-containing IUD, your doctor may recommend that you consider another method of contraception. If blood tests indicate that you are anemic, you will need to take iron supplements.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > **Endometrial biopsy**]\nFor an endometrial biopsy, the doctor takes a sample of tissue from the endometrium (lining of the uterus) for analysis in the laboratory for signs of cancer. Using an instrument called a speculum to open the vagina, the doctor stabilizes the cervix with a clamp and then inserts a very thin, flexible tube (endometrial sampler) into the uterus to take the tissue sample.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the procedure of endometrial sampling. A speculum holds the cervix open, and an endometrial sampler is inserted into the uterus to collect tissue samples.]()![](_page_1559_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nIf these measures do not limit the bleeding after a few months, your doctor may evaluate your pelvic organs using an ultrasound scan called a sonohysterogram. Even if no abnormality is found, the doctor may consider doing a hysteroscopy (see below) to examine the inside of your uterus. If a problem is found, the doctor will perform a procedure called endometrial ablation. In endometrial ablation, the doctor removes all or most of the lining of the uterus (endometrium) using a controlled delivery of heat from a balloonlike device inserted through the hysteroscope into the cavity of the uterus. Because endometrial ablation destroys the lining of the uterus, a woman's fertility is affected. The procedure is performed mainly on women who want to avoid the major surgery of a hysterectomy. In some circumstances, however, a hysterectomy is the best treatment.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Hysteroscopy]\nTo diagnose some gynecologic conditions, such as heavy or prolonged periods or bleeding between periods, a doctor needs to examine the inside of the uterus. In a procedure called hysteroscopy, the doctor can view the uterus directly to diagnose, evaluate, and treat disorders such as uterine fibroids, endometrial polyps, hyperplasia (thickening of the lining of the uterus), or benign or malignant tumors. Hysteroscopy can be performed in a hospital outpatient clinic or in a doctor's office using local anesthetic with sedation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Hysteroscopy > Hysteroscopy]\nDuring a hysteroscopy, the doctor inserts a flexible, lighted viewing instrument called a hysteroscope through the vagina into the uterus. He or she introduces a small amount of liquid or gas through the hysteroscope to\n\nexpand the uterus. The doctor can also pass medical instruments through the hysteroscope to remove growths from the uterus or to perform procedures such as biopsies.\n\n![Diagram illustrating a hysteroscope being inserted into the uterus via the vagina to perform a procedure, such as a biopsy or removal of growths.]()![](_page_1560_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Premenstrual Syndrome]\nThe combination of physical and emotional changes that sometimes occur in the week or so before your period is called premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Doctors believe that PMS results from hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle. A number of other factors may also contribute—such as changes in the levels of a chemical messenger in the brain called serotonin (which helps regulate mood), stress, inadequate levels of some vitamins and minerals, eating salty or caffeine-containing foods, or drinking excessive amounts of alcohol.\n\nUp to 75 percent of women who menstruate experience some uncomfortable premenstrual symptoms, and 30 to 40 percent have symptoms serious enough to disrupt their dail", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "will ask questions", "tail": "extent of bleeding"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "examine", "tail": "abnormality in your uterus"}, {"head": "Pap smear", "relation": "check for cancer", "tail": "cervix"}, {"head": "endometrial biopsy", "relation": "screen for cancer", "tail": "uterus"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "will ask questions", "tail": "[Event: find out the extent of bleeding]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "examine", "tail": "[Event: see whether there could be an abnormality in your uterus]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: heavy bleeding]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: anemia]"}, {"head": "[Event: heavy bleeding]", "relation": "identifies", "tail": "[Event: blood or hormone problem]"}]}, "status": "success"}

The term perimenopause is often used to describe the transition phase that occurs during the 3 to 5 years before menopause. After menopause, your body makes much less of the female sex hormones, especially estrogen. In the years leading up to menopause, your menstrual cycle changes and your periods may become irregular as your hormone levels rise and fall. Eventually your periods stop altogether. Doctors consider menopause to be complete when a woman has not had a period for 1 year. The average age of menopause in the United States is 51 years, but it can occur earlier or later and varies from woman to woman. Cigarette smokers tend to reach menopause earlier than nonsmokers; toxins in cigarette smoke damage the ovaries, decreasing their normal span of activity. With an average life expectancy of 81 years, a woman can expect to live more than one third of her life after she has gone through menopause.\n\nWomen of childbearing age who have had both of their ovaries removed during a hysterectomy (see page 870) experience an abrupt menopause called surgical menopause. Because their hormone production ends so quickly, these women may experience the symptoms of menopause more severely than women who go through menopause naturally.\n\nIf you are sexually active, remember that you may still be fertile as you start menopause. Continue to use contraceptives for 12 to 24 months after the date of your last period.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nMost women experience some symptoms during menopause. Only about 10 percent of women aren't aware of any changes at menopause other than an end to their periods. You may begin to notice some signs during perimenopause that come and go before your periods stop completely. Hot flashes are the most common symptom of menopause, affecting more than 60 percent of menopausal women in the United States.\n\nSee your doctor right away if you bleed between periods, have prolonged or excessive menstrual bleeding, or have any bleeding 6 months or more after what\n\nappeared to be your last period. These symptoms could signal a number of disorders, including a precancerous condition or cancer of the uterus (see page 869).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms > Hot flashes]\nA hot flash is a sudden physical sensation of intense heat that usually affects the upper part of the body but can affect the whole body. Your face and neck may become flushed, and red blotches may appear on your chest, back, and arms. Hot flashes, which can last from a few minutes to half an hour, cause profuse sweating, sometimes followed by chills as your body struggles to readjust its temperature. Hot flashes happen unexpectedly—more often at night—and usually start several years before other symptoms of menopause. They should gradually decline in frequency and intensity as you get older. Most women who have hot flashes experience them for no more than 2 years. Hot flashes seem to be the body's response to a falling estrogen level, which affects the body's temperature regulator in the brain. They usually occur without warning, but some women find that alcohol, stress, or caffeine can trigger hot flashes or make them worse.\n\nHormone therapy (see next page) relieves the discomfort of hot flashes for most women. Some women find that taking vitamin E provides minor relief. Taking a herb called black cohosh (sold as a vitamin supplement) and eating foods containing soy seem to help reduce the intensity and frequency of hot flashes in some women. To better cope with hot flashes, dress in layers so you can take off a layer when you feel a hot flash coming on. Drink a glass of cold water at the first sign of a hot flash, and keep a pitcher of ice water or an ice pack next to your bed.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms > Changes in the vagina and urinary tract]\nAs you age, the walls of your vagina become thinner, dryer, and less elastic, sometimes causing pain during intercourse. You may find it helpful to lubricate your vagina before intercourse with a water-soluble lubricant to help reduce the risk of infection. Don't use petroleum jelly; it can damage latex condoms and cause allergic reactions in some women.\n\nThe tissue in your urinary tract also changes at menopause, making you more vulnerable to stress incontinence (the involuntary leaking of urine; see page 877). Activities such as jogging or heavy lifting—or even sneezing, coughing, or laughing—can put enough pressure on your bladder to release a small amount of urine. Doing Kegel exercises (see page 874) regularly can help alleviate or reverse mild stress incontinence in menopausal women.\n\nAfter menopause, your vagina and urinary tract may also become more susceptible to infection. To prevent urinary infections, drink lots of water, keep your genitals clean,\n\nand wash your genitals before and after intercourse.

The breasts also play a role in a woman's sexuality. Breast sensitivity and sexual response vary among women, but most women's breasts undergo a number of physiologic changes in response to sexual stimulation. In some women, hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle make the breasts a little larger and tender before periods.\n\nThe size and shape of a woman's breasts are determined primarily by genes. Most of the breast consists of fat, which is layered around milk glands, milk ducts, and supporting fibers. The nipple contains 15 to 20 tiny openings, which are the outlets of milk ducts or sebaceous (oil) glands. The sebaceous glands secrete an oily substance that lubricates and protects the skin. Around the nipple is a pigmented area called the areola, which can vary greatly in size, shape, and color from one woman to another. Small muscles behind the areola make the nipple erect when stimulated. The system of milk glands and ducts radiates out from the nipple.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Breast Disorders > The breast]\nA woman's breasts consist mostly of fatty tissue surrounding a system of milk glands (called lobules), milk ducts, and connective tissue. The milk glands and ducts radiate out from the nipple. During pregnancy, the milk-producing glands become active. At about the time of childbirth, the milk glands secrete milk into the ducts, where it is stored until an infant needs it. A layer of muscle lies behind each breast.\n\n![Diagram of a breast showing internal structures. Labeled parts include: Chest muscle, Fatty tissue, Milk glands, Milk duct, Nipple, and Ribs.]()![](_page_1568_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nInfection-fighting lymph nodes drain lymph fluids from the breast to three major areas—the armpit, the area just above the collarbone, and the area under the breastbone. The breasts can develop abnormal growths such as cysts or tumors, or conditions that can result from infections. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and the second most common cause of cancer death in women (after lung cancer). To detect signs of breast cancer at an early, more curable stage, every woman should do a monthly breast self-examination, have regular manual examinations by her doctor, and have regular mammograms, usually starting at age 40.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Breast Disorders > Nipple Discharge]\nA whitish or gray-green discharge just before or after childbirth is likely to be breast milk, especially if it comes from both nipples. If you have a milky discharge at any other time, it is called galactorrhea (see next page), and can be a sign of an underlying\n\ndisorder. You need not worry if you have nipple discharge only when the nipple is manipulated, such as during foreplay; this is a normal physiologic response.\n\nAny spontaneous nipple discharge, however, should be evaluated by a doctor. Note whether the discharge comes from one nipple duct (one of the tiny holes in the nipples) or from many. If the discharge is dark (usually dark red or black), especially if it comes from only one breast, see your doctor. The dark coloring is usually caused by blood in the discharge, often from a tiny benign growth in the milk duct called a duct papilloma. In rare cases, however, a dark discharge from the nipple could also be a sign of breast cancer.\n\nYour doctor will examine your breasts and may analyze a sample of the discharge. He or she may also recommend other diagnostic tests, including a mammogram (see page 141) and an ultrasound (see page 111). If anything suspicious is found on the mammogram or ultrasound, the doctor will recommend a biopsy, in which a small sample of tissue is removed from the breast for examination under a microscope. If you have a duct papilloma, it can be removed in a simple surgical procedure.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Inverted Nipples]\nSome women's nipples are naturally inverted, which is normal for them. The only possible disadvantage of inverted nipples is that they can make breastfeeding more difficult. However, if your nipples are not normally inverted and you notice, especially on only one breast, that a nipple (or any part of your breast) is pulled in, see your doctor. He or she will examine the breast and may order diagnostic tests to rule out breast cancer.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Paget's Disease of the Nipple]\nPaget's disease of the nipple is an uncommon form of breast cancer that starts in the milk ducts of the nipple. Without treatment, the cancer can gradually spread deeper into breast tissues. The disease resembles the skin condition eczema (see page 1062) and usually affects only one nipple. The nipple itches and burns and may have a sore that doesn't heal.\n\nIf you have symptoms of Paget's disease, your doctor will probably recommend removing a small piece of tissue from the affected breast for examination under a microscope for cancer cells (biopsy", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "genes", "relation": "determine", "tail": "size and shape of a woman's breasts"}, {"head": "hormonal fluctuations", "relation": "make", "tail": "the breasts a little larger and tender"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

These areas are referred to as breast lumps. Breast lumps often do not cause any discomfort, but they can sometimes be tender or painful.\n\nAlthough breast lumps are usually not a cause for concern, always see your doctor if you notice any changes (including seemingly minor ones) in your breasts. Lumps can have a number of causes. They can be cysts (noncancerous fluid-filled sacs), or they can result from thickening of the milk-producing glandular tissue inside the breasts (called fibrocystic changes). They can also result from infections or from noncancerous growths such as fibroadenomas. All of these kinds of lumps are harmless, but, because lumps can also be cancerous, it's essential to have them checked by a doctor. You might want to watch the lump through one menstrual cycle before seeing a doctor because benign lumps sometimes disappear after a menstrual cycle.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Benign Lumps and Cysts]\nMost lumps that develop in the breasts are harmless, noncancerous growths. Some women have naturally lumpy breasts that tend to develop numerous cysts or fibrous growths. Fibroadenomas are solid lumps that can range from the size of a pea to the size of a lemon.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Benign Lumps and Cysts > Breast cysts]\nCysts are fluid-filled sacs that can develop in the breasts. They are harmless, noncancerous growths that sometimes go away on their own. Some women have several cysts in their breasts, which is normal for them. A doctor may sometimes recommend withdrawing fluid from a lump to confirm that it is indeed a cyst and not a solid mass, which could be cancerous. A lump can also be identified as a cyst using ultrasound.\n\n![Diagram of a breast showing glandular tissue and two fluid-filled sacs labeled 'Cyst'.]()![](_page_1572_Picture_5.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Benign Lumps and Cysts > Fibrocystic breasts]\nSome women have a condition called fibrocystic breasts, in which they have several small lumps and cysts in one or, usually, both breasts. This is not a disease. However, women who have fibrocystic breasts should become familiar with the location and size of these lumps through regular breast self-examinations so they can recognize any changes and bring them to their doctor's attention.\n\n![Diagram of a breast showing several small lumps (Lumps) and larger cysts (Cysts) within the breast tissue.]()![](_page_1573_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Benign Lumps and Cysts > Fibroadenomas]\nFibroadenomas are solid lumps that are firm and rubbery and can be moved around easily. Fibroadenomas seldom cause pain and don't change in response to hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle, although they can sometimes grow larger during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Doctors only remove them when they are unusually large, when they do not appear to be characteristic benign fibroadenomas on an image (such as a mammogram or ultrasound), or if cells taken in a needle biopsy look abnormal. If a needle biopsy confirms that a lump is a benign fibroadenoma, it is not removed but is monitored regularly for changes.\n\n![Diagram of a breast showing a lump. The diagram labels the lump as a 'Fibroadenoma' and the surrounding tissue as 'Fibroadenomas'.]()![](_page_1574_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you still feel the lump after a menstrual cycle, see your doctor, whether or not the lump is painful. You should also see your doctor if a lump you have had for a long time becomes painful or feels different in some way (such as harder or bigger).\n\nYour doctor will examine both breasts and, if the lump feels suspicious, recommend that you have a diagnostic mammogram to evaluate it. The radiologist who studies your mammogram may suggest that you have an ultrasound (see page 111) to determine if the lump is a harmless cyst or a solid mass of tissue that could be cancerous. The radiologist may also recommend taking a sample of tissue from the lump for examination under a microscope for cancer cells (biopsy).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > Needle aspiration or biopsy]\nIf you have a lump that looks like a cyst but the doctor is not absolutely sure is a cyst, he or she may recommend withdrawing fluid from the lump with a needle. The doctor locates the lump with his or her fingers and, often guided by ultrasound, inserts the needle into the lump. If fluid comes out, the lump is a cyst, and it will collapse as the fluid is removed. If no fluid comes out, the doctor may then use a larger needle to withdraw tissue from the lump to examine it for cancer cells.\n\n![Illustration showing a needle being inserted into a breast lump and withdrawing fluid or tissue for aspiration.]()![](_page_1575_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe treatment for a breast lump depends on the nature of", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "breast lumps", "relation": "can result from", "tail": "infections"}, {"head": "breast lumps", "relation": "can result from", "tail": "noncancerous fluid-filled sacs"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment]"}, {"head": "[Event: thickening of the milk-producing glandular tissue inside the breasts]", "relation": "results in", "tail": "[Event: breast lumps]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Performing a breast self-examination (see page 138) every month will help you detect a lump early. Have a mammogram (see page 141) as frequently as your doctor recommends, usually starting at about age 40. When a tumor is detected at an early stage and treated before it has spread, you can expect a complete cure or many years of good health.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nIf you have breast cancer, you may feel a lump or thickening in or near your breast or in the underarm area during a breast self-examination. The lump may or may not be painful; breast pain is usually a sign of a noncancerous condition, although there are exceptions. Although most breast lumps turn out to be benign, see your doctor if you find a lump or notice any of the following:\n\n- A change in the size or shape of a breast\n- Spontaneous nipple discharge (especially if it is dark in color) or nipple tenderness\n- A nipple that is suddenly pulled back into the breast (inverted)\n- Ridges or pitting of the breast resembling an orange peel\n- A change in the look or feel of the skin of the breast, areola, or nipple (such as warm, swollen, red, or scaly)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosis]\nIf you have a lump in your breast or if a lump is detected on a routine mammogram, your doctor will perform a manual breast examination to determine whether more tests are required to rule out cancer. He or she may recommend that you have a diagnostic mammogram to get a close-up view of the area of the lump or an ultrasound of the breast. Your doctor or a breast surgeon may perform a biopsy (take a sample of tissue from the lump for examination under a microscope) or remove fluid or tissue from the lump with a needle (needle aspiration or biopsy; see previous page).\n\nIf the lump is found to be cancerous, you will probably have more tests. MRIs (see page 113) and PET scans (see page 114) are being used increasingly to help evaluate breast tumors. A PET scan can help determine if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes under the arms, but a lymph node biopsy is always done to confirm this. A PET scan can also show whether an advanced cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\n\nOther tests used for diagnosing breast cancer include a hormone receptor test performed on the cancerous tissue to determine if estrogen or progesterone (female sex hormones) stimulates the cancer to grow. Sometimes the tissue is examined to look for a gene called human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), a tumor marker that is associated with an especially aggressive form of breast cancer.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosis > Ductal lavage]\nA test called ductal lavage is used to evaluate the risk of breast cancer in women who are at high risk, such as those who have a family history of breast cancer. In ductal lavage, an anesthetic cream is applied to the nipple area to reduce discomfort, and a breast pump with gentle suction is applied to the nipple to draw out tiny amounts of fluid from the milk ducts. When fluid is found in a milk duct, the milk duct is washed out with salt water infused through a tiny tube (catheter) inserted into the duct. The collected cells are then examined in the laboratory for precancerous changes or cancer.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosis > Ductoscopy]\nDuctoscopy is a procedure that uses a thin (smaller than 1 millimeter in diameter), flexible viewing tube (ductoscope) inserted through the nipple into a milk duct to evaluate nipple discharge for abnormalities. The tube is connected to a camera that allows the doctor to examine the ducts directly on a video monitor. Ductoscopy may eventually prove to be useful before a woman has breast-conserving surgery (see next page) to help determine how much tissue to remove, or as a screening test for women who are at high risk of breast cancer.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosis > *Treatment*]\nThe treatment of breast cancer is complex and depends on many variables, including the characteristics of the tumor (which can sometimes help a doctor determine if it is likely to grow rapidly), whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes or to another part of the body, and the sensitivity of the tumor cells to estrogen (which can stimulate tumor growth in some women). Treatment options for a particular woman also depend on her general health. Surgery is usually the first treatment for breast cancer, which may be followed by radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or biological therapy, or a combination of these.\n\nAfter any treatment for breast cancer, doctors recommend frequent checkups, at least twice yearly. If breast cancer recurs, it can usually be controlled for many years with drugs, radiation therapy, and, sometimes, more surgery.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosis > When breast cancer spreads]\nGroups of lymph nodes ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "breast cancer", "relation": "treats", "tail": "mammogram"}, {"head": "lump", "relation": "causes", "tail": "pain"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "you", "relation": "perform", "tail": "[Event: breast self-examination]"}, {"head": "you", "relation": "have", "tail": "[Event: mammogram]"}, {"head": "tumor", "relation": "detected", "tail": "[Event: early stage detection]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: tumor detected at an early stage]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment before it has spread]"}, {"head": "[Event: breast cancer diagnosed]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: lump or thickening in the breast]"}]}, "status": "success"}

As with any surgery, there is a risk of infection, slow wound healing, bleeding, or an allergic reaction to the anesthetic used for the surgery.\n\nThe skin in the area where the breast was removed may be tight, and the muscles in your arm and shoulder may feel stiff. After a mastectomy, some women have some permanent loss of strength in these muscles, but for most women this reduced strength is temporary. Your doctor, nurse, or a physical therapist will recommend exercises you can do to help regain movement and strength in your arm and shoulder.\n\nIf nerves were injured or cut during the surgery, you may have numbness and tingling in your chest, underarm, shoulder, or upper arm. These symptoms usually go away within a few weeks or months as the injury heals. Sometimes, when lymph nodes under the arm are removed, fluid can build up in the arm and hand and cause swelling (lymphedema). You will need to take precautions to protect your arm and hand on that side from injury or pressure; let your doctor know right away if an infection develops in your arm or hand.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Incision for skin-sparing mastectomy > **Radiation therapy**]\nRadiation therapy, the use of high-energy rays to kill cancers in localized areas of the body, is often used in addition to surgery to treat breast cancer. The radiation may be directed at the breast from a machine (called external radiation) or inserted into the breast in thin plastic tubes placed at the site of the cancer (called implant radiation).\n\nFor external radiation therapy, a person goes to a hospital or clinic, usually 5 days a week for 6 weeks. For implant radiation, a person stays in the hospital with the implants in place for several days. In some cases, especially for small tumors that are removed in breast-conserving surgery such as lumpectomy, radiation therapy is given after surgery to destroy any breast cancer cells that may remain. For large tumors that cannot be removed easily with surgery, radiation is sometimes given before surgery, alone or with chemotherapy or hormone therapy (see below), to destroy cancer cells and shrink the tumor.\n\nFatigue is the most common side effect of radiation therapy, especially after several treatments. Although rest is important, your doctor will recommend that you try to stay as active as you can. The skin in the treated area may become red, dry, tender, and itchy, and the treated breast may feel heavy and hard. These symptoms will clear up after the treatments stop. Because the skin in the treated area will be especially tender, you should wear loose-fitting clothing and expose the area to the air as often as possible to help the skin heal. Your doctor will tell you how to care for your skin during this time.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Chemotherapy]\nFor cancer that has spread from the breast, chemotherapy, usually as a combination of drugs, is given to kill cancer cells throughout the body. The drugs are given in pills or by injection at an outpatient clinic, at the doctor's office, or at home.\n\nThe side effects of chemotherapy depend on the particular drugs and the dosage. Along with cancer cells, chemotherapy destroys healthy cells, especially those that divide rapidly, such as blood cells and the cells in hair roots and in the lining of the digestive tract. This cell loss can increase your susceptibility to infections and cause easy bruising or bleeding, weakness and fatigue, loss of hair, poor appetite, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, or mouth and lip sores. Many of these side effects can be controlled with medication and are usually short term. Because the effects of chemotherapy on a fetus are unknown, doctors usually recommend that women avoid getting pregnant during their treatment; discuss birth control (see page 470) with your doctor before your treatment starts.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Hormone therapy for breast cancer]\nFor women whose breast tumors are stimulated by estrogen, hormonal medications such as tamoxifen or raloxifene may be given (usually for 5 years) to block the growth-stimulating effects of the hormone on the tumor. In addition to treating breast cancer, these drugs are also used to prevent breast cancer in high-risk women.\n\nThe side effects of hormone therapy depend on the particular drug or type of treatment. Tamoxifen may cause hot flashes, vaginal discharge or irritation, nausea, and\n\nirregular periods. Women who are still menstruating may become pregnant more easily when taking tamoxifen. Tamoxifen increases the ri", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "pain-relief", "relation": "treats", "tail": "pain"}, {"head": "anesthetic", "relation": "causes", "tail": "allergic reaction"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "prescribes", "tail": "[Event: pain-relief medication]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "experiences", "tail": "[Event: infection]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "experiences", "tail": "[Event: slow wound healing]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "experiences", "tail": "[Event: bleeding]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment]"}, {"head": "[Event: slow wound healing]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: pain-relief medication]"}, {"head": "[Event: bleeding]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: treatment]"}]}, "status": "success"}

One experimental biological treatment uses antibodies (immune proteins) that block the growth factor receptors on breast cancer cells, which prevents the cells from growing and multiplying. Many of these treatments are available through clinical trials. Ask your doctor about participating in a clinical trial.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Ovaries, Uterus, and Cervix]\nThe two ovaries and the uterus make up the primary female reproductive organs. The ovaries sit on either side of the uterus, just above the pubic bone, and move freely within a small area. Each ovary contains thousands of eggs, which a woman is born with. During your fertile years, one egg (or sometimes more) ripens each month and is released into a fallopian tube. As the egg travels slowly down the tube toward the uterus, it can be fertilized by a sperm. The uterus lies in the pelvis, behind the bladder. The walls of the uterus consist of powerful muscles that contract to push out a baby during delivery. At the lower end of the uterus is a narrow, thick-walled structure called the cervix, which leads into the vagina.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Ovaries, Uterus, and Cervix > The female reproductive system]\n![Diagram of the female reproductive system showing the Fallopian tube, Uterus, Fallopian tube, Ovary, Ovary, Cavity of uterus, Cervix, and Vagina.]()![](_page_1588_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Ovarian Cysts]\nAn ovarian cyst is a sac full of fluid that forms on or in an ovary. Most ovarian cysts are harmless and go away on their own within a couple of months. Others can interfere with the ovary's production of sex hormones or become cancerous; for this reason, all cysts should be evaluated by a doctor. Ovarian cysts are common in women of childbearing age and are usually caused by the changing hormone levels that naturally occur during the menstrual cycle. Ovarian cysts can range from the size of a pea to the size of a grapefruit. A woman may develop one cyst at a time or many. Multiple cysts that form repeatedly month after month characterize a disorder called polycystic ovarian syndrome (see next page).\n\nThe most common types of ovarian cysts are functional cysts, dermoid cysts, and endometriomas. Functional cysts form when tissue in the ovary changes during the normal process of ovulation. There are two kinds of functional cysts: follicular and corpus luteum cysts. Follicular cysts develop when the matured follicle containing an egg fails to rupture and release the egg. Instead, the follicle grows larger and becomes a cyst. Functional cysts usually disappear on their own after a few menstrual cycles. The corpus luteum is a normal glandular mass that develops in an ovary every month after the mature follicle releases an egg. The corpus luteum can develop into a cyst if the opening through which the egg is released is sealed off. A corpus luteum cyst usually dissolves on its own within a few months.\n\n**WARNING!**\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Ovarian Cysts > Ruptured Ovarian Cyst]\nIf you have severe pain in your lower abdomen, along with fever and vomiting, call 911 or your local emergency number, or go to the nearest hospital emergency department immediately. Excessive blood loss could cause symptoms of shock (see page 162)—including light-headedness, cold and clammy skin, and rapid breathing—and can be fatal.\n\nDermoid cysts are composed of different types of tissues—such as skin, hair, fat, and teeth—that are normally found in other parts of the body. Endometriomas are blood-filled cysts that develop when tissue from the endometrium (the lining of the uterus) grows in an ovary. Endometriomas can bleed during menstruation and are signs of endometriosis (see page 870).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Ovarian Cysts > *Symptoms*]\nOvarian cysts seldom produce symptoms but may cause a dull ache in the lower abdomen, and pain during intercourse. Some cysts twist, bleed, or rupture, causing sudden sharp pain and internal bleeding, which is life-threatening. When a cyst affects hormone production, symptoms include irregular vaginal bleeding or an increase in body hair.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Ovarian Cysts > Common Ovarian Cysts > Functional cyst]\nThe most common type of functional cyst occurs when an egg matures but the follicle fails to rupture and release it. The follicle continues to grow, enlarging the entire ovary.

Although ovarian cancer can occur at any age, it is most common after age 50. The cancer can originate in the ovary or appear as a secondary growth that has spread to the ovary from elsewhere in the body. Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (see page 858) increase a woman's risk of both breast and ovarian cancer. In women without these genetic mutations, the cause of ovarian cancer is not known.\n\nSeveral factors can increase a woman's chances of developing ovarian cancer. Risk factors include having a close relative (mother, sister, or daughter) with the disorder, or a personal history of breast cancer or colon cancer. Ovarian cancer seems to be related to the number of times a woman ovulates during her lifetime, with the risk of the disease lower in women who have ovulated less, such as women who have taken birth-control pills. For this reason, women who have never had children (and, therefore, never had a 9-month break from ovulation) and women who have taken fertility drugs (which stimulate ovulation) may be at increased risk. Conversely, women who have taken birth-control pills (and, therefore, have ovulated fewer times) have a significantly lower risk of developing ovarian cancer than other women.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nOvarian cancer often produces no symptoms until late in its development. Eventually, it may cause lower abdominal pain or discomfort, including gas, indigestion, swelling, bloating, or cramps. The first sign may be the feeling that your clothes are getting tighter around your waistline for no obvious reason. Appetite loss, frequent urination, and\n\nnausea accompanied by diarrhea or constipation are common. You may also have a feeling of fullness even after light meals.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nOvarian cancer is difficult to detect in its early stages because the ovaries lie deep inside the pelvis and initial symptoms are vague. If you have any symptoms of ovarian cancer, or if you have a family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer, your doctor will order an ultrasound to examine your ovaries. If the ultrasound shows multiple cysts on your ovaries, or solid growths containing abnormal tissue (which could indicate cancer), the doctor will do further tests. A blood test that measures the levels of a substance called CA-125 (CA stands for cancer antigen), which is found in high amounts in women with ovarian cancer, can be useful in detecting the disorder in women who are past menopause. In younger women, mildly elevated levels of CA-125 can be present in many noncancerous conditions such as fibroids (see right), endometriosis (see page 870), or pelvic inflammatory disease (see page 871).\n\nSometimes doctors use a series of X-rays of the colon and rectum (a lower GI series; see page 767) or a CT scan (see page 112) to detect ovarian cancer.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf tests detect ovarian cancer, surgery is usually necessary to remove both ovaries, the fallopian tubes, and the uterus (hysterectomy; see page 870). Any cancerous tissue inside the abdomen that may have spread from the ovary and affected lymph glands will also be removed to make sure that no cancer cells remain. Chemotherapy (see page 23) is usually given to kill cancer cells throughout the body and prevent the cancer from recurring or slow its progression (if it has already begun to spread). In rare cases, radiation therapy (see page 23) is used to destroy localized areas of cancer. Blood tests are performed periodically to monitor the effects of the chemotherapy. Any fluid from the tumor that collects in the abdomen can be drained from time to time. The outlook for survival depends on the stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis—generally, the earlier the stage at diagnosis, the better the survival rate. Receiving treatment from a doctor who specializes in gynecologic cancers (called a gynecologic oncologist) can significantly improve a woman's chances of survival.\n\nSome women who are at high risk of ovarian cancer choose to have their ovaries removed before cancer develops. This procedure usually—but not always—protects a\n\nwoman from ovarian cancer.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Fibroids]\nA fibroid (also called a myoma) is a benign (noncancerous) tumor in the uterus that can grow large but is unlikely to spread. The tumor develops either inside the muscular wall of the uterus or on the uterine wall, sometimes attached to the wall by a stalk of tissue. Some fibroids take many years to grow to the size of a pea, while others may reach the size of a grapefruit within a few years.\n\nFibroids are common—up to 30 percent of women over age 30 have them. Fibroids seldom occur before age 20 and are most common between ages 35 and 45. If you have one fibroid, you are likely to develop others.

The most obvious symptom of uterine cancer is vaginal bleeding in a woman who has gone through menopause and who has not had periods for some time. Women who are still menstruating may have unusually heavy periods or bleeding between periods. A woman may also have a vaginal discharge that ranges from a watery, pink fluid to a thick, brown, foul-smelling discharge. Uterine cancer may or may not cause intermittent pain similar to menstrual pain.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have any irregular vaginal bleeding, your doctor will perform an endometrial biopsy (see page 849) to take a sample of endometrial tissue from the uterus for examination under a microscope. This procedure is done in the doctor's office, takes only a few minutes, and produces only minor, temporary discomfort. A doctor may also perform a hysteroscopy (see page 849) or a D and C (see left) to diagnose cancer of the uterus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nWhen cancer of the uterus is confirmed, the standard treatment is surgical removal of the uterus, along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes, in a hysterectomy (see below). Radiation therapy (see page 23) and sometimes chemotherapy (see page 23) may be used instead of—or in addition to—surgery. If the cancer is detected at an early stage, your chances for a complete recovery are excellent. About 80 percent of women who are treated in the early stages of uterine cancer are cured.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Hysterectomy]\nThe uterus, sometimes along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes, are removed to treat several different gynecologic disorders, especially in women who are at or near menopause. Because there may be other ways of treating a particular disorder, you may want to get a second opinion from another doctor before deciding to have a hysterectomy.\n\nIn the most commonly used method of hysterectomy, the surgeon removes the uterus through an incision in the lower abdomen. Alternatively, the surgeon may make the incision at the top of the vagina and remove the uterus from below. A woman usually is given a general or spinal anesthetic for the surgery, which takes about 1 to 2 hours.\n\nAfter a hysterectomy, you may experience some vaginal bleeding and discharge for a few days. Your doctor will encourage you to get out of bed and walk around a little the day after the surgery, and you can probably go home in a few days. You should be able to resume your usual activities within 6 to 8 weeks. Removal of the ovaries in a woman who has not yet reached menopause stops estrogen production and brings about early menopause. In this case, the doctor may recommend taking estrogen supplements (hormone therapy; see page 853).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Endometriosis]\nThe lining of the uterus is called the endometrium. During each menstrual cycle, part of the endometrium thickens, becomes engorged with blood, and (if conception does not occur) sheds during menstruation. Endometriosis causes the same kind of tissue to develop in other parts of the pelvic cavity—such as on the ovaries or (less commonly) on the fallopian tubes, vagina, or intestines. The endometrial tissue can also develop on\n\nscars that have formed in the abdominal wall after surgery. Each month, these abnormal endometrial tissue fragments bleed like the lining of the uterus does during menstruation. However, because the fragments are embedded in tissue, the blood cannot escape. Instead, the blood collects in sacs (cysts), or the bleeding irritates the surrounding tissue, which responds by forming a fibrous covering around each bleeding area. Over time, scar tissue (adhesions) can develop.\n\nIn its mild form, endometriosis is common. Because endometriosis is linked to menstruation, it occurs only during a woman's reproductive years, most often between ages 25 and 50. Endometriosis is most common in women who have not had children. After the onset of menopause, the development of the abnormal endometrial tissue subsides.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Endometriosis > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nIn some cases, endometriosis causes no symptoms or only mild or unnoticeable symptoms. In most cases, symptoms include pain in the lower abdomen or lower back just before periods. Sometimes periods are irregular, with spotting before the flow begins. Intercourse may be painful. Endometriosis can cause infertility if the fallopian tubes become blocked by scarring.\n\nThe most common diagnostic procedure used to detect endometriosis is laparoscopy, an outpatient surgical procedure in which the doctor uses a lighted viewing instrument (laparoscope) to see inside the pelvic cavity.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Endometriosis > *Treatment*]\nMild cases of endometriosis that don't cause symptoms do not require treatment. If symptoms are severe, doctors frequently remove the abnormal tissue during laparoscopy by cutting it out or destroying it with heat.

The infection is usually introduced through the vagina during sexual intercourse with an infected person. The sexually transmitted diseases chlamydia (see page 477) and gonorrhea (see page 480) are very common causes of PID. Pelvic infections are most common in young, sexually active women and least common in women who have reached menopause. If the infection is not treated, an abscess (a pus-filled sac) may form in a fallopian tube or\n\novary, causing scarring and potentially damaging the fallopian tubes. Blockage of the fallopian tubes from the infection can cause infertility (see page 493).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease** > *Symptoms*]\nAn acute or sudden pelvic infection causes severe pain and tenderness in the lower abdomen and may also cause a high fever. A chronic pelvic infection may cause mild, recurring pain in the lower abdomen and sometimes pain in the back, along with a low-grade fever. In both acute and chronic forms of PID, you may experience pain during intercourse, have irregular periods, and have a heavy, foul-smelling vaginal discharge.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease** > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose PID, a doctor will perform a pelvic examination and take samples of fluid from inside the cervix. Laboratory analysis of this fluid will help identify the infectious organism that is causing the condition. He or she will also order an ultrasound (see page 111) to look for an abscess around the ovary.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease** > *Treatment*]\nAntibiotics are the first treatment for PID; in severe cases, antibiotics are given intravenously (through a vein) in the hospital. If antibiotics do not clear up the infection, or if an abscess shows no signs of shrinking, a doctor may perform a laparoscopic procedure (through a small incision in the abdomen) to remove as much of the infected tissue as possible. Recovery and fertility both depend on the extent of the infection and the surgery required to treat it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Pelvic Support Problems**]\nThe uterus, vagina, and other lower abdominal organs are held in place by strong pelvic muscles and ligaments at the base of the abdomen. If these supporting muscles and ligaments are weakened, they can no longer support organs in the pelvis (such as the bladder, urethra, uterus, vagina, small intestine, and rectum), causing the organs to slip from their original position. Pelvic floor muscles can become stretched and weakened by a number of factors, including injury during vaginal delivery, loss of muscle tone that\n\ncan accompany aging, decreased estrogen production after menopause, chronic constipation (which causes straining during bowel movements), a chronic respiratory condition (which can cause persistent coughing), or lifting heavy objects.\n\nThe uterus, bladder, rectum, and urethra are especially vulnerable to sagging or prolapse when pelvic floor muscles become weakened. Minor degrees of prolapse are common, especially for a few months after childbirth and later in life. A prolapse can be uncomfortable and inconvenient but poses few risks to your overall health.\n\nFollowing are some of the most common types of pelvic support problems, which often occur together:\n\n- **Prolapse of the uterus** When the uterus drops from its normal position, it sags downward. This process causes a bulging of the front or back wall of the vagina. Sometimes the uterus may descend so far that the cervix or even the entire uterus bulges out of the body (called a complete prolapse). The displacement of the uterus often brings other pelvic organs, such as the bladder or intestines, down with it.\n- **Cystocele** A cystocele occurs when the bottom of the bladder drops into the front of the vagina.\n- **Cystourethrocele** A cystourethrocele results from the weakening of the tissues supporting the urethra and bladder.\n- **Enterocele** An enterocele forms when a part of the intestine bulges into the top of the vagina.\n- **Rectocele** A rectocele is the bulging of the rectum into the vagina.\n- **Vaginal vault prolapse** Vaginal vault prolapse occurs when the top part of the vagina (called the vaginal vault) loses its support from the uterus after a hysterectomy (see page 870) and collapses.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe involuntary leaking of urine may be the first sign of a pelvic support problem. A cystourethrocele often causes stress incontinence (see page 877). You may feel a sensation of heaviness and discomfort in your pelvis and an ache in your lower back, especially after lifting or otherwise straining your muscles. If the condition has progressed, and if the back wall of the vagina has descended, bowel movements can be difficult.

Abnormal cells in the cervix are usually found on a routine Pap smear. To confirm the diagnosis after an abnormal Pap smear, a doctor will perform a colposcopy, an examination of the cervix using an instrument with a lighted magnifying lens. Doctors often take a sample of tissue for analysis under a microscope (biopsy) during a colposcopy to determine if dysplasia is present and, if so, to evaluate it and classify it as LGSIL or HGSIL. Some doctors also take a swab of cells from the cervix to determine if HPV is present and, if so, if it is one of the strains of the virus that are strongly linked to cervical cancer.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nLGSIL (mild) dysplasia often returns to normal on its own and usually can be managed with frequent follow-up care, including Pap smears every 4 to 6 months. More severe dysplasia (HGSIL), which is more likely to develop into cervical cancer, is usually treated surgically. The procedure doctors use most often to treat dysplasia is called by either of two names—LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure) or LLETZ (large-loop excision of the transformation zone). Both names refer to the removal of the outer layer of cervical cells, which are at highest risk of becoming cancerous. The removed tissue is sent to a laboratory for examination to make sure that all the abnormal cells were removed. Your doctor will advise you not to have intercourse or use tampons for 4 weeks after the procedure. The doctor will recommend a Pap smear every 4 months for the first year after a colposcopy, which has a 95 percent success rate in removing abnormal tissue.\n\nIf the area of abnormal tissue extends up into the cervical canal, a procedure called a cone biopsy (in which the doctor removes a cone-shaped piece of tissue) may be required. The tissue is sent to a laboratory to look for cancer cells. This procedure is usually performed in an operating room using a local anesthetic during an outpatient visit. Afterward, you may need to rest for a day or so. In very rare cases, a cone biopsy can increase the risk of premature delivery in a future pregnancy, so if you have had a cone biopsy and become pregnant, tell your doctor that you have had the procedure.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **LEEP/LLETZ**]\nThe procedure doctors use most often to treat cervical dysplasia is called by one of two names, LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure) or LLETZ (large-loop excision of the transformation zone). During the procedure, the doctor inserts a rubber-coated,\n\nnonconductive speculum to hold open the vagina and then uses a thin-wire, loop electrode to slice off the abnormal tissue with a low-level electric current. LEEP/LLETZ takes less than 30 minutes and requires only a local anesthetic.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the procedure of LEEP/LLETZ (Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure). A speculum holds the vagina open, and a loop electrode is used to excise abnormal tissue from the cervix, near the uterus.]()![](_page_1610_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Cancer of the Cervix]\nCervical cancer occurs when abnormal cells on the outer layer of the cervix (the lower opening of the uterus) spread deep into the tissues of the cervix, or to nearby lymph glands, and up into the uterus. Most cases of cervical cancer develop in women who have either undiagnosed or untreated cervical dysplasia (see previous page) or its more advanced form, called carcinoma in situ. Cervical dysplasia refers to the presence of abnormal, precancerous cells in the lining of the cervix.\n\nDeaths from cervical cancer have declined sharply, thanks to the prevalence of Pap smears (see page 140). Cancer of the cervix is nearly 100 percent preventable if cervical dysplasia is detected by a Pap smear in its early stages. The majority of women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer have not had a Pap smear within the past 3 years. The more advanced the cancer, the more difficult it is to treat—which makes the Pap smear a potential lifesaver.\n\nSome factors increase the chances that cells in the lining of the cervix will become abnormal or cancerous. The most important risk factor is exposure to certain strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause the common sexually transmitted disease genital warts (see page 480). Other risk factors include having sex at a young age, having unprotected sex at any age, having multiple sex partners, or having a sex partner who has had multiple partners or who has had a partner with HPV or cervical cancer. Smoking is also a risk factor for cervical cancer.

The bacteria first infect the urethra and then travel up to infect the bladder. Most women have an episode of cystitis at some time in their life. It is especially common during times of increased sexual activity, such as on a honeymoon. Left untreated, the infection can spread to the kidneys, causing a kidney infection called acute pyelonephritis (see page 804).\n\nTo help prevent bladder infections, always wipe from front to back after bowel movements, drink lots of water, keep your genitals clean, wash your genital area before and after intercourse, and empty your bladder after intercourse.

You may also have a fever. Other urinary tract problems, such as urethritis (see next page), can produce similar symptoms.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosis]\nIf you have symptoms of cystitis, your doctor will ask you for a midstream urine specimen in which you collect the urine sample in a sterile container after you have started to urinate. The doctor will test the sample in the office for pus, which indicates an infection, and then send the sample to a laboratory to identify the organism that is causing the infection.\n\nIf you have more than two or three episodes of cystitis within 6 to 12 months, your doctor may refer you to a urologist (a doctor who specializes in urinary tract disorders), who can determine whether you have a urinary tract abnormality that is making you susceptible to bladder infections. The urologist will examine you and may ask for additional midstream specimens of urine. Sometimes an ultrasound is performed to detect an abnormality. You may also have a procedure called an intravenous pyelogram (IVP), which is an X-ray of the kidneys and bladder, and an examination of the bladder called a cystoscopy, in which the doctor uses a viewing instrument to see inside your urethra and bladder.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf your symptoms are very mild and you do not have a fever, try to flush your urinary tract by drinking lots of fluids—at least eight large glasses a day—to relieve your symptoms. Drinking cranberry juice may help flush out bacteria. If the symptoms persist longer than 24 hours or are severe, see your doctor. He or she will prescribe antibiotics or other drugs to treat the condition.\n\nIf you have recurring infections and if diagnostic tests find an abnormality in your urinary tract, the urologist will treat it. If no abnormality is found, the urologist may prescribe low-dose antibiotics or antibacterial drugs for you to take for a month or more, or only around the times you have intercourse.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Stress Incontinence]\nA sheet of muscles called the pelvic floor muscles lies at the base of the abdomen. These muscles support the bottom of the bladder and help close the top of the urethra, the short channel through which urine passes. When you have stress incontinence, your pelvic floor muscles are so weak that the pressure produced by coughing, sneezing, or laughing can cause an involuntary release of urine.\n\nStress incontinence is very common—up to 50 percent of women over age 60 experience it to some degree. The pelvic floor muscles can be weakened by vaginal\n\nchildbirth or obesity. The lack of estrogen after menopause can also weaken these muscles, sometimes producing prolapse of the uterus or vagina (see page 872). Chronic lung conditions, such as emphysema (see page 656), that cause persistent coughing, can also contribute to stress incontinence.\n\nAt any age, women can have stress incontinence during exercise, particularly high-impact sport", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "bladder", "relation": "holds", "tail": "urine"}, {"head": "ureters", "relation": "drains", "tail": "bladder"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

The symptoms are similar to those of cystitis (see previous page), except that they last for only 1 or 2 days. Infection is the usual cause\b\b\boften a sexually transmitted disease such as chlamydia (see page 477)\b\b\balthough the microorganism that is responsible cannot always be easily identified. The urethra can also become inflamed during intercourse or from exposure to some spermicides, bath oils, or other chemical irritants.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nChronic urethritis causes burning and stinging during urination, frequent urination, and a sudden urge to urinate.\n\nIf you have symptoms of urethritis, the doctor will ask you for a sample of urine for analysis to find out if an infection is causing the problem. He or she may also take a sample of vaginal discharge to determine if you have a sexually transmitted disease. If these tests do not show signs of infection, the doctor may perform a cystoscopy, in which he or she uses a viewing instrument to examine the inside of your urethra.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf the underlying cause of the inflammation is an infection, it can usually be treated successfully with antibiotics or antibacterial drugs. If no infecting organism is found, the doctor will recommend that you empty your bladder completely after each time you have intercourse or after you engage in any other activities that could irritate your urethra, such as riding a bicycle vigorously or for a long time. Keep your genitals clean by washing them before and after having intercourse. Ask your partner to wash his genitals before intercourse.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Vagina and Vulva]\nThe vulva is the outer area that surrounds the opening to the female urinary and reproductive systems. It consists of two outer folds of tissue called the outer labia, which lie on each side of the openings of the urethra and the vagina. The vulva also includes the inner labia, folds of tissue that enclose several lubricating glands and the clitoris (a small, sensitive organ that swells in response to sexual stimulation). The vagina is the passage that connects the vulva with the uterus. The tissues of the vulva are susceptible to skin problems such as warts or severe itching. The lining of the vagina and glands in the vulva produce fluid that cleanses the vagina, lubricates it during intercourse, and makes it easier for sperm to pass up to the uterus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Vagina and Vulva > The vulva]\n![Diagram illustrating the vulva, showing the outer labia, inner labia, clitoris, urethral opening, and vagina.]()![](_page_1619_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Vagina and Vulva > Bacterial Vaginosis]\nBacterial vaginosis (often referred to as BV) is the most common vaginal infection. It results from an overgrowth of one or more types of bacteria (usually *gardnerella* bacteria) that are normally present in the vagina in smaller amounts. When these bacteria overgrow, they prevent the protective bacteria from maintaining a healthy balance of microorganisms in the vagina. The infection can affect the vagina, urethra, bladder, and skin in the genital area.\n\nBacterial vaginosis occurs most often during the reproductive years, although women of all ages are susceptible. The infection is usually not serious, but if not treated can increase the risk of infection after pelvic or vaginal surgery. In pregnant women, the infection can increase the risk of preterm labor and delivery (see page 529).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nIn many cases, bacterial vaginosis causes no symptoms and is diagnosed during a routine pelvic examination. If you have symptoms, you may notice that you have more vaginal discharge than usual or that your vaginal discharge is milky with an unpleasant, fishy odor that is worse after sexual intercourse. Other symptoms include itching or burning in or near the vagina.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nSome women mistake bacterial vaginosis for a yeast infection and try to treat it with an over-the-counter product. If you have symptoms of bacterial vaginosis or if you tried to treat a yeast infection with an antifungal vaginal medication and it did not clear up, see your doctor. The doctor will make a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis based on a number of criteria. Because the doctor needs to test your vaginal secretions to make a diagnosis, do not douche or use vaginal creams or suppositories for a couple of days before you see the doctor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTo treat bacterial vaginosis, doctors usually prescribe an antibiotic vaginal gel or cream that a woman inserts for 5 to 7 days. Oral antibiotics such as metronidazole are sometimes prescribed. For severe or recurring cases, a doctor may recommend oral antibiotics for both the woman and her sex partner.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Va", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "chlamydia", "relation": "cause", "tail": "chronic urethritis"}, {"head": "spermicides", "relation": "irritant", "tail": "urethra"}, {"head": "bath oils", "relation": "irritant", "tail": "urethra"}, {"head": "chemical irritants", "relation": "irritant", "tail": "urethra"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "infection", "relation": "cause", "tail": "[Event: chronic urethritis]"}, {"head": "exposure to spermicides", "relation": "cause", "tail": "[Event: urethral inflammation]"}, {"head": "intercourse", "relation": "cause", "tail": "[Event: urethral inflammation]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: chronic urethritis]"}, {"head": "[Event: exposure to spermicides]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: urethral inflammation]"}, {"head": "[Event: intercourse]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: urethral inflammation]"}]}, "status": "success"}

The most common site of cancer of the vulva is the labia majora (outer lips of the vulva). Most women with cancer of the vulva are over age 50, although it is becoming more common in women under 40. Infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV; see page 480) is the most likely cause. Cancer of the vulva tends to grow very slowly and is highly curable when diagnosed at an early stage. If the cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes, the overall survival rate after treatment is 90 percent.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nCancer of the vulva starts as a small, hard lump in the skin, which gradually breaks down on the surface to form an ulcer (open sore). The ulcer has thickened, raised edges\n\nand may ooze or bleed from the center. The ulcer gradually enlarges and, if it is not treated, will eventually spread to other parts of the body.\n\nIf you have any lump or ulcer on your vulva, your doctor will perform a pelvic examination and take a small sample of tissue for examination under a microscope (biopsy) for cancer cells.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > ***Treatment***]\nTreatment for cancer of the vulva depends on the stage of the cancer. If the cancer is in its early stages and is present on only the surface of the skin, the doctor will probably remove it surgically. If the tumor has invaded the deeper part of the vulva but has not spread to nearby tissue, the doctor will surgically remove it, along with surrounding skin and nearby lymph nodes. Radiation therapy (see page 23) may be given after the surgery if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.\n\nCancer that has spread to nearby tissues requires surgical removal of the entire vulva (and possibly the lower colon, the rectum, or the bladder), followed by radiation therapy. The doctor may recommend chemotherapy (see page 23) along with the radiation therapy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Hormonal Disorders]\nHormones are chemical messengers that are produced by a network of glands called the endocrine system and released directly into the bloodstream, which carries them to organs and tissues throughout the body. A hormone circulating in the bloodstream affects only the target organs or tissues for that hormone. Together with the nervous system (see page 665), the endocrine system coordinates and controls many essential body processes. For this reason, a problem in any part of the endocrine system can affect many body functions.\n\nThe endocrine system includes the following glands:\n\n- **Pituitary gland** The pituitary is a pea-sized gland that is suspended from the base of the brain. The pituitary gland is the most important endocrine gland and is often called the master gland because it produces hormones that control other endocrine glands and many essential body processes.\n- **Hypothalamus** The hypothalamus is a small structure at the base of the brain, below the thalamus (a structure deep inside the brain that processes sensory information) and above the pituitary gland. The hypothalamus coordinates production and release of hormones by the pituitary gland, the thyroid gland, the adrenal glands, the ovaries, and the testicles.\n- **Thyroid gland** The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland at the base of the neck, directly below the larynx (voice box) and in front of the trachea (windpipe). The thyroid produces the hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine, which have an important role in metabolism (the chemical processes that take place in the body), and calcitonin, which helps regulate the calcium level in the blood and enhances bone formation.\n- **Parathyroid glands** The parathyroid glands are two pairs of pea-sized glands next to the thyroid gland. The parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone, which helps regulate the calcium level in the blood.\n- **Adrenal glands** The adrenal glands are two small, triangular glands on top of the kidneys. The adrenal glands produce corticosteroid hormones, which have an important role in metabolism; epinephrine, which helps the body respond to stress or danger; aldosterone, which helps regulate blood pressure and the sodium and potassium levels\n\nin the blood; and testosterone, which stimulates development of male sexual characteristics.\n\n**The endocrine system** The endocrine system is a group of glands and tissues that secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream to regulate many body processes. The major endocrine glands are the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, the thyroid gland, the parathyroid glands, the adrenal glands, the pancreas, the ovaries (in women), and the testicles (in men).\n\n![Diagram illustrating the major endocrine glands in the human body.

Pituitary gland tumors usually\n\ndevelop in the anterior lobe. The exact cause of pituitary tumors is not known, but evidence suggests that they may result from mutations in specific genes involved in cell growth.\n\nThere are two main types of pituitary tumors—pituitary adenomas and craniopharyngiomas. Pituitary adenomas are overgrowths of cells in the pituitary gland that are usually noncancerous. Although most of these tumors are less than  $\\frac{1}{2}$  inch in diameter, they grow in a confined space and can press on and damage surrounding nerves, blood vessels, and other tissues.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nAbout half of all pituitary adenomas secrete abnormal amounts of the hormone prolactin. These tumors (called prolactinomas) may cause no symptoms, or they may cause erection problems (see page 486) in men or absence of menstrual periods or breast swelling and abnormal milk production in women. Pituitary adenomas may also secrete other hormones, leading to acromegaly (see next page), gigantism, or Cushing's disease (see page 898).\n\nCraniopharyngiomas do not cause overproduction of any hormones but, as they enlarge, they can press on the anterior lobe, causing hypopituitarism (see page 887), or on the posterior lobe, causing diabetes insipidus (see page 887). A craniopharyngioma can also press on the optic nerves, causing headaches, double vision, and eventually blindness.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nDiagnosis of a pituitary tumor is based on the symptoms and a physical examination. Your doctor will recommend blood and urine tests to measure the levels of a number of hormones and to evaluate the functioning of the pituitary gland. High levels of some hormones can be a sign of a tumor. If your vision has been affected, the doctor will recommend visual field testing. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor will order a CT scan (see page 112) or MRI (see page 113) of the pituitary gland to locate the tumor and evaluate it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Hormone-Producing Tumors]\nSome cancerous tumors may secrete hormones or chemicals that imitate hormones, causing symptoms similar to those that result from overactive endocrine glands. For example, lung cancers may secrete hormones that are similar to corticotropin (the pituitary hormone that stimulates the adrenal glands), parathyroid hormone, or arginine vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone). Carcinoid tumors of the intestine (see page 761) also may secrete these hormones. Tumors of the islet cells in the pancreas (which produce insulin) also often secrete abnormal hormones. Because a wide range of tumors may secrete similar hormones, it can be difficult to identify the tumor that is causing the problem. However, a doctor will make a thorough evaluation of any suspected hormone-producing tumor. Surgery or radiation therapy to remove or destroy the tumor may help relieve the symptoms.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nProlactinomas often can be treated successfully with dopamine agonists (such as bromocriptine), which control the growth of the tumor. Taking a long-acting dopamine agonist such as cabergoline twice a week can shrink the tumor, often making surgery unnecessary or easier to perform. Dopamine agonists are drugs that imitate the actions of the chemical messenger dopamine and suppress the secretion of growth hormone by the pituitary gland. However, the most effective treatment for some prolactinomas and all other types of pituitary tumors is surgery or radiation therapy or, in some cases, a combination of both.\n\nSurgery to remove a pituitary tumor is a delicate procedure that is performed as the surgeon looks through a powerful microscope (microsurgery). The tumor is reached either through a nostril or through a small hole that the surgeon creates in the bridge of the nose. If the tumor is large and is pressing on the optic nerves, open-brain surgery may be required. There is a risk that the pituitary gland will be damaged during surgery, which can lead to hypopituitarism or diabetes insipidus, or both. These disorders are treated with lifelong hormone replacement therapy.\n\nIn some cases, the surgeon may destroy the tumor with extreme cold (cryosurgery; see page 22) or by inserting tiny radioactive implants (called radioactive pellets or seeds) into the tumor. If the tumor is large or if it is difficult to pinpoint, the doctor may use radiation therapy on the entire gland. Like surgery, radiation therapy can damage the pituitary gland. Although the long-term outlook depends largely on the size of the tumor, in many cases a complete cure is possible.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Acromegaly]\nAcromegaly is a rare condition in which a noncancerous pituitary tumor (see previous page) causes the pituitary gland to produce too much growth hormone.

These disorders include hypothyroidism (see page 903), Addison's disease (see page 899), infertility (see page 493), absence of menstrual periods (see page 846), and short stature.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA diagnosis of hypopituitarism is based on the symptoms and a physical examination. Your doctor will probably perform blood and urine tests to measure the levels of pituitary hormones and evaluate the functioning of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. If the test results indicate that you have hypopituitarism, your doctor may recommend a CT scan (see page 112) or MRI (see page 113) to look for a pituitary tumor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe treatment for hypopituitarism involves taking oral and intravenous medications that replace the hormones of the pituitary and other affected endocrine glands. Hormone replacement therapy may be needed to treat underproduction of hormones by the thyroid gland, the adrenal glands, the ovaries (in women), or the testicles (in men).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Diabetes Insipidus**]\nDiabetes insipidus is a disorder in which a deficiency of arginine vasopressin (AVP; also called antidiuretic hormone, or ADH) causes the body to produce large quantities of diluted urine (urine that contains a high percentage of water). AVP, which is produced by the hypothalamus and released by the posterior (rear) lobe of the pituitary gland, regulates the process of water reabsorption in the body and prevents the body from producing too much urine. In normal urine production, the kidneys filter water and other substances from the blood, reabsorbing nearly all of the filtered water and leaving only urine to be eliminated from the body. The reabsorbed water is returned to the bloodstream to maintain normal concentrations of minerals, proteins, and other chemicals in the blood and other body fluids. However, in diabetes insipidus, the kidneys do not reabsorb the filtered water, and it is eliminated from the body in urine.\n\nDiabetes insipidus usually results from damage to the hypothalamus or to the pituitary gland caused by a severe head injury. The condition may also result from scarring or damage caused by surgery on the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland, or as a side effect of radiation therapy on the pituitary or surrounding tissue. In rare cases, diabetes insipidus is caused by pressure on the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland from a pituitary tumor (see page 885). In a form of the disorder called nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the condition results from an insensitivity of the kidney tubules to AVP; the levels of AVP in the bloodstream are normal, but the kidneys do not respond properly to reabsorb water.\n\nDiabetes insipidus may develop gradually or occur suddenly. If not treated promptly, the disorder can quickly cause dehydration, which can result in very low blood pressure and shock (see page 162).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptoms of diabetes insipidus are excessive thirst and passing large quantities of urine (as much as 20 quarts a day). The need to drink and urinate is strong and constant throughout the day and night.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA diagnosis of diabetes insipidus is based on the symptoms and a physical examination. If your doctor suspects that you have diabetes insipidus, he or she will probably recommend that you have a water deprivation test, which can be performed in the doctor's office. During the test, which takes several hours to complete, you will not drink any fluids. The doctor will measure your weight and the volume and concentration of your urine at regular intervals. If the volume of water in your urine remains high and your urine is diluted, you have a deficiency of AVP. To confirm the diagnosis, after the water deprivation test is stopped, the doctor gives you an injection of synthetic AVP (vasopressin). If your symptoms are relieved, you have diabetes insipidus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe first step in therapy for diabetes insipidus is to treat the underlying cause. The most effective treatment is vasopressin, taken either in nose drops or by mouth. The length of time you must take the drops or pills is determined mainly by the cause of the disorder.\n\nIf diabetes insipidus was caused by a head injury, surgery, or radiation therapy, taking vasopressin may help the defective gland return to normal within a year, and your symptoms will disappear. If your symptoms don't go away, you will probably have to take the medication for the rest of your life.

Young children may not understand why they must stick to a special diet and can't have candy and soft drinks like other kids. But parents and caregivers need to be firm and consistent in enforcing the child's diet. Many teenagers go through periods of rebellion, and teenagers with diabetes may react against the restrictions the disease imposes on them. In this case, it is essential to consult a psychiatrist or counselor who can work with the teen to help him or her cope with the emotional and social ramifications of having a chronic disease and to encourage him or her to regain control over it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nThe symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop rapidly, within weeks or months. See your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms:\n\n- Unusually frequent urination, sometimes as often as every hour or so, throughout the day and night.\n- Unusual thirst from excessive loss of fluid; drinking sweetened beverages increases urination and makes the thirst worse.\n- Fatigue, weakness, and apathy that can make it hard to get up in the morning.\n\n- Significant weight loss, especially in children and young adults, because fat and muscle are burned for energy, and the glucose lost in urine is a major source of calories.\n- Tingling in the hands and feet.\n- Reduced resistance to infections, especially boils and vaginal yeast infections (see page 880). Bladder infections and other urinary tract problems can develop from bacteria that are attracted to the glucose in the urine.\n- Blurred vision resulting from excess glucose in the fluid of the eye.\n- Erection problems (see page 486) in men and absence of menstrual periods (see page 846) in women.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you have symptoms of diabetes, your doctor will ask you for a urine sample to test for glucose and ketones; their presence in the urine indicates that you probably have diabetes. If only glucose is present in your urine, your doctor will ask for a blood sample to measure the amount of glucose in your bloodstream. A blood glucose test (see page 895) is necessary for a diagnosis because you can have some glucose in your urine without having diabetes. A diagnosis of diabetes is made if the blood glucose level is 126 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or higher.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Long-Term Complications of Diabetes]\nWhen uncontrolled, both forms of diabetes can have long-term consequences, damaging blood vessels, kidneys, and nerves. The best ways to avoid the following serious complications are to keep your blood glucose level in a healthy range and to see your doctor regularly—even when you feel fine.\n\n- **Heart disease** The changes in the body's chemistry brought on by an elevated glucose or insulin level can lead to the buildup of fatty deposits inside the arteries (atherosclerosis; see page 557). These changes can also make the blood clot more easily, leading to the formation of blood clots that can block blood flow and cause a heart attack or stroke. High blood pressure linked to diabetes can also lead to heart disease and stroke.\n- **Nerve damage** An elevated level of glucose reduces the ability of nerves to carry messages to various parts of the body, including the feet and legs, bladder, digestive system, and reproductive system. Depending on the tissues\n\naffected, nerve damage (neuropathy) can cause symptoms that include loss of feeling; muscle weakness; tingling, burning, or jabbing sensations; vomiting; frequent bladder infections; and sexual problems.\n\n**Peripheral vascular disease** An elevated glucose level can cause narrowing of the blood vessels that deliver blood to the feet and legs. Without a regular supply of nourishing oxygen-rich blood, the tissues that are farthest away from the heart can die. In severe cases, part or all of a foot or leg may need to be amputated.\n\n**Eye damage** Diabetes can damage the small blood vessels that supply the back of the eye, causing them to leak blood or other fluid into the eye. This condition, called diabetic retinopathy, is a major cause of blindness in people between ages 25 and 74. Having diabetes also increases a person's risk of other vision-robbing eye disorders, such as cataracts (clouding of the lens of the eye) and glaucoma (buildup of pressure from excess fluid inside the eye). For this reason, if you have diabetes, you should see an eye doctor (an ophthalmologist) every year for a complete eye examination.\n\n**Kidney disease** Diabetes can cause narrowing of the blood vessels that carry blood to the kidneys, reducing their ability to filter out and eliminate wastes from the body.

The insulin most frequently prescribed is identical to human insulin, produced in bacteria or yeast. Insulin can currently only be injected or infused, although studies are under way to determine the effectiveness and safety of insulin formulations that can be inhaled, eaten, or absorbed through the skin or mucous membranes. Several modified versions of human insulin are available that produce effects rapidly or over a longer time.\n\nThe best control is usually achieved by giving yourself injections once or twice a day of a long-acting insulin and injections of a rapidly acting insulin at mealtimes. Your doctor will show you how to inject the insulin just under the skin of your thigh, arm, or abdomen. Most people learn to do this expertly within a few days. (If you have a child with diabetes, you will need to administer the injections until the child is about 10.) Always make sure that you obtain the same type and strength of insulin each time you renew your prescription.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Taking Care of Your Feet]\nIf you have diabetes, you are at risk of damage to the nerves and blood vessels in your feet, which can reduce their sense of feeling and limit the circulation of blood to them. If you don't have feeling in your feet, you can injure them and not realize it. In addition, the reduced flow of blood to the feet can make injuries heal slowly or not at all, which can cause the tissue to die (a condition called gangrene). In severe cases, amputation is necessary to save the rest of the foot and leg. The following steps can help you avoid these serious but common complications of diabetes:\n\n- Inspect your feet every day for scratches, cuts, blisters, ingrown toenails, or warts on the soles (called plantar warts; see page 1060); using a mirror can help you see the bottoms of your feet better. If you notice anything unusual, see your doctor right away.\n\n- Immediately report to your doctor any signs of infection, burning, tingling, or numbness in your feet.\n- Do not cut or treat corns or calluses yourself. Have a doctor remove them.\n- Make sure your doctor examines your feet at each visit.\n- Wash your feet every day and dry them well, especially between the toes.\n- Shake out your shoes before putting them on to make sure there aren't any pebbles or other objects that could cause a cut or blister.\n- Wear comfortable, well-cushioned shoes that do not pinch at the toes or scrape at the heel. Try wearing shoes that are a half size larger than you normally wear. Never wear shoes with high heels.\n- Break in new shoes slowly.\n- Change your socks every day. Wear socks that wick away moisture. Smooth your socks or panty hose over your feet carefully, leaving no lumps that could cause chafing or blisters.\n- Put a moisturizer on your feet nightly if your skin is dry.\n- Never walk barefoot, even in your own home.\n- Don't smoke. Smoking reduces blood flow to your feet.\n- To prevent ingrown toenails and infections, be extra careful when you trim your toenails. Cut your nails straight across from side to side (ask your doctor to show you how). If you have numbness in your feet, you should not trim your own nails.\n- To prevent scalding, do not test the water temperature in your bath with your feet.\n- Have a podiatrist examine and care for your feet regularly.\n\nIn addition to the standard insulin syringe, a variety of disposable penlike devices are available. These devices allow you to inject insulin by turning a dial to select the dose. Each device can hold about 150 to 300 units of insulin. In some cases, the pen is prefilled with insulin; in others, a disposable cartridge is used, providing added convenience to people who take multiple injections a day. Always inspect your pens and cartridges to make sure that you have been given the correct kind of insulin (rapidly acting, long-acting, or mixed).\n\nAn alternative to multiple daily injections of insulin is a course of treatment called continuous insulin therapy, which uses an external, wearable device (called an insulin pump) to infuse specific amounts of insulin automatically and continuously through a\n\nthin plastic tube inserted under the skin, usually on the abdomen. Several small, highly reliable insulin pumps are currently available that are about the size of a pager and can hold up to a 3-day supply of insulin. The pumps are about as effective as daily injections, but many people find the pumps more convenient and comfortable. Because the pumps do not sense blood glucose levels, you still need to do frequent blood sugar tests for best results. (Implantable insulin pumps remain experimental.)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Checking blood glucose levels]\nMany people with diabetes find it helpful to", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Insulin", "relation": "prescribed for", "tail": "diabetes"}, {"head": "human insulin", "relation": "produced in", "tail": "bacteria or yeast"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "prescribes", "tail": "[Event: clinical trial]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "participates in", "tail": "[Event: clinical trial]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

Several promising studies are under way.\n\nBecause of the complexity of pancreas transplant surgery and successfully suppressing the immune system to prevent organ rejection, researchers are looking for ways to transplant just the insulin-secreting cells into people with diabetes to enable them to go without insulin.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pancreas transplant]\nIn most cases, a pancreas transplant and a kidney transplant are performed at the same time. The donor pancreas and duodenum usually are implanted first, in the right lower abdomen, and connected to the recipient's blood vessels and bladder. The donor kidney and ureter are then implanted in the left lower abdomen and connected to the recipient's blood vessels and bladder.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the location of transplanted organs in the abdomen, including the Transplanted donor kidney, Transplanted donor pancreas, Transplanted donor duodenum, Bladder, Pelvis, Iliac artery, Iliac vein, and Transplanted donor ureter.]()![](_page_1644_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Type 2 Diabetes]\nNine out often people with diabetes have type 2. In type 2 diabetes, the body does not respond appropriately to the hormone insulin, and there may be a corresponding lack of insulin secretion to compensate for the degree of resistance. Insulin enables cells to take in and use glucose, a simple sugar that is the body's main source of energy, or store it as fat.\n\nThe incidence of type 2 diabetes is reaching epidemic proportions throughout the world as more and more people adopt a lifestyle of exercising too little and eating too much—and getting fatter. More than a third of the 15 million Americans who have type 2 diabetes do not know they have it because the disease has no noticeable symptoms in the early stages. More and more American children are developing type 2 diabetes because they are increasingly less active than children of previous generations; eating more high-fat, high-calorie fast foods; and becoming obese. Just a few years ago it was rare to see children affected by this form of the disease, which used to be called adult-onset diabetes. However, today one out of five children who develop diabetes has type 2.\n\nAs people gain weight, the extra weight causes their cells to become resistant to the effects of insulin. The pancreas responds by producing more and more insulin, which eventually begins to build up in the blood. High levels of insulin in the blood, a condition called insulin resistance, can result in problems such as high blood pressure and harmful changes in the levels of the different kinds of fats in the blood. Insulin\n\nresistance, which doctors sometimes refer to as syndrome X or the metabolic syndrome (see page 53), is the first step toward type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe second step toward type 2 diabetes is a condition called impaired fasting glucose (also referred to as impaired glucose tolerance or prediabetes), which occurs when the pancreas can no longer produce enough insulin to get glucose out of the bloodstream into cells. Glucose begins to build up in the blood. If not diagnosed and treated, it is this gradual rise in glucose that will eventually lead to type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease—in any order and in any combination. It is estimated that as many as 16 million Americans over age 40 have prediabetes. Uncontrolled, diabetes can lead to stroke, blood circulation problems, kidney failure, and blindness. Complications from diabetes are the major cause of limb amputations.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Type 2 Diabetes > *Risk Factors*]\nYou are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you have any of the following risk factors:\n\n- You have a family history of type 2 diabetes—for example, a parent or sibling with the disease.\n- You are obese—you have a body mass index (BMI; see page 11) of 27 or higher. Having too much body fat, especially around the abdomen, can make your cells resistant to the effects of insulin, causing glucose to build up in the blood.\n- You are Native American or of African, Asian, or Hispanic descent.\n- You are 45 or older. The risk of type 2 diabetes tends to increase with age.\n- You have been diagnosed with impaired fasting glucose, detected by a blood test showing a glucose level between 110 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) and 126 mg/dL.\n- You have high blood pressure, defined as blood pressure readings consistently higher than 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).\n- Your level of HDL (good) cholesterol is 40 mg/dL or lower, or your triglyceride level is 250 mg/dL or higher (see page 146).\n- You deve", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "insulin", "relation": "enable", "tail": "people"}, {"head": "insulin", "relation": "go without", "tail": "insulin"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "researchers", "relation": "looking for ways to intervene", "tail": "[Event: prevent abnormal immune response]"}, {"head": "researchers", "relation": "looking for ways to control or reverse diabetes", "tail": "[Event: once it develops]"}, {"head": "researchers", "relation": "transplant just the insulin-secreting cells", "tail": "[Event: into people with diabetes]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: complexity of pancreas transplant surgery]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: suppressing the immune system]"}, {"head": "[Event: suppressing the immune system]", "relation": "prevents", "tail": "[Event: organ rejection]"}]}, "status": "success"}

If you have too much glucose in your blood, the extra glucose links with the hemoglobin. This blood test can determine the average level of glucose in your blood over the past 3 to 4 months. For this reason, doctors use it to monitor the effectiveness of treatment in people who have diabetes.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nManaging type 2 diabetes means keeping your blood glucose level as close to normal as possible. Helpful strategies include keeping your weight down or losing weight if you need to, exercising regularly, and eating a nutritious diet rich in vegetables, whole grains, and legumes such as dried peas and beans. Eat fruit in moderation, and limit fruit juice (because it can raise blood sugar quickly). Many people with type 2 diabetes can keep their blood glucose level in a healthy range by following these measures.\n\nYour doctor may recommend that you also take medication, depending on factors such as how long you have had diabetes, how high your blood glucose level is, and other medications you are taking. Although your doctor may prescribe insulin injections, taking insulin is usually not part of the initial treatment of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor may ask you to test your blood glucose level frequently or to have a hemoglobin A1C test (see previous page) periodically to evaluate the effectiveness of your treatment. You will have frequent blood tests to determine if your treatment is effective in keeping your glucose level in the healthy range.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Medication]\nMany types of medication are available for treating type 2 diabetes. If you take too much of some glucose-lowering medications (particularly sulfonylureas), your blood glucose level can drop too low. This condition—called hypoglycemia (see next page)—can be serious. Like all medications, these drugs can cause side effects in some people. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel unusual in any way after you start taking a medication.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Medication > *Metformin*]\nMetformin reduces glucose level by decreasing the liver's production of glucose. The drug also helps cells take in glucose and use it. Metformin is the only drug for diabetes that does not frequently cause weight gain. It can sometimes cause gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea and therefore should be taken with meals. It is available in several forms and is sometimes taken in combination with an insulin-stimulating drug and a thiazolidinedione medication (see right) such as rosiglitazone or pioglitazone.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Medication > *Acarbose*]\nAcarbose is a drug you take with the first bite of a meal. This medication limits the rise in glucose that usually occurs after eating by decreasing the amount of glucose your body produces.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Medication > *Insulin-stimulating drugs*]\nA class of drugs called insulin-stimulating drugs (including sulfonylureas and nonsulfonylureas) stimulates the pancreas to make more insulin, which, in turn, lowers the glucose level. These drugs sometimes stop working after a few months or years or if you gain weight or if your body is under stress, such as when you have a bad infection or have had a heart attack or surgery.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Medication > *Thiazolidinediones*]\nThiazolidinediones (TZDs) are a newer class of drugs that improve insulin sensitivity and may have other beneficial effects. Like metformin, they seldom cause too-low glucose levels. They can be used alone or in combination with other sugar-lowering drugs, such as metformin, or even with insulin.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Medication > *Insulin*]\nSome people with type 2 diabetes who have difficulty lowering their glucose level with glucose-lowering pills need to have insulin shots, or a combination of glucose-lowering pills and insulin. Your doctor may recommend trying different combinations to see which works best for you. If you need insulin, your doctor will give you precise instructions about how to give yourself shots and how often to give them. Eating about the same amount of food every day at approximately the same time can make adjusting\n\nthe doses of medication easier to maintain the delicate balance between the level of insulin and the level of glucose in your blood. Your doctor or a diabetes educator can design a program tailored to your lifestyle and preferences.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prevention*]\nExercising regularly and keeping your weight in a healthy range (see page 11) are the two most effective measures you can take to avoid type 2 diabetes.

Each adrenal gland has a central core (adrenal medulla) and an outer layer (adrenal cortex). The adrenal medulla produces two hormones—epinephrine and norepinephrine—that have an important role in controlling heart rate and blood pressure and the body's response to stress. The hypothalamus in the brain stimulates the adrenal glands to produce these hormones.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Adrenal Glands > The adrenal glands]\nThe adrenal glands are on top of each kidney. The adrenal glands produce corticosteroid hormones, which help regulate metabolism (the chemical processes that take place in the body), and the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine, which help control heart rate and blood pressure and the body's response to stress.\n\n![Diagram of a human torso showing the location of the adrenal glands, aorta, vena cava, and kidneys.]()![](_page_1653_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nThe adrenal cortex produces three different groups of corticosteroid hormones. The hormones in the first group regulate the concentration and balance of various chemicals in the body. The most important hormone in this group is aldosterone, which helps control blood pressure and regulates sodium and potassium levels in the body. The hormones in the second group have a number of functions, including helping to convert carbohydrates into energy-rich glycogen in the liver. (Glycogen has an essential role in regulating blood sugar levels.) Cortisol is the main hormone in this group.\n\nThe third group of hormones consists of androgens (male sex hormones) and estrogen and progesterone (female sex hormones), which regulate sexual development and the functioning of the reproductive system. Sex hormones are produced mainly by the testicles and the ovaries. Although both sexes produce male and female sex hormones, androgens are more prevalent in men and estrogen and progesterone are more prevalent in women.\n\nThe pituitary gland controls the production of most corticosteroid hormones. The only exception is aldosterone, which is stimulated by the hormone renin, produced by the kidneys.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Cushing's Syndrome]\nCushing's syndrome is a rare condition that results from an excess of corticosteroid hormones in the blood. The disorder usually results from taking large doses of corticosteroid drugs for long-term treatment of an inflammatory illness such as rheumatoid arthritis (see page 918) or asthma (see page 640). In rare cases, the condition develops when the outer layer of one or both adrenal glands (the adrenal cortex) produces excessive amounts of corticosteroid hormones. Overproduction of corticosteroid hormones can occur when a tumor in one of the adrenal glands or elsewhere in the body over-stimulates the adrenal glands. If the tumor that is causing the excess hormone production is in the pituitary gland in the brain, the condition is called Cushing's disease rather than Cushing's syndrome. Cushing's syndrome is most common in young to middle-aged women.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of Cushing's syndrome usually appear gradually, over a period of several months. First, the face becomes large and round. Excess fat forms on the body, and a pad of fat develops between the shoulder blades. At the same time, muscles in the arms and legs lose mass and weaken. The skin may become thinner and may bruise easily. Over time, blood pressure increases and the bones become thin and fracture easily (osteoporosis; see page 989).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is based on the symptoms and a physical examination. The doctor will recommend blood and urine tests to measure the levels of cortisol, the major corticosteroid hormone. If cortisol levels are high, the doctor may recommend a 24-hour urine test to evaluate pituitary function and determine if there is a tumor in the pituitary gland. For a 24-hour urine test, you collect a sample of urine each time you urinate over a 24-hour period. Depending on the test results, the doctor may also recommend a CT scan (see page 112) or an MRI (see page 113) to look for a tumor in the pituitary or in the adrenal glands. If no tumor is detected, he or she may recommend an X-ray or CT scan of the lungs to check for lung cancer (some tumors in the lungs secrete corticosteroidlike hormones).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf long-term corticosteroid treatment for another disorder is the cause of Cushing's syndrome, your doctor will either adjust the dosage of the medication you are taking or prescribe a different drug.

Aldosteronism can result from a tumor in one adrenal gland (called Conn's syndrome) or from an enlargement of both adrenal glands. The disorder also can be caused by an underlying disease or condition that reduces blood flow through the kidneys, such as congestive heart failure (see page 570).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Aldosteronism > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nThe symptoms of aldosteronism include elevated blood pressure, fatigue, tingling, muscle weakness, muscle spasms, and paralysis. Some people also may experience increased thirst and frequent urination.\n\nA diagnosis of aldosteronism is based on the symptoms and a physical examination. The doctor will recommend blood and urine tests to measure aldosterone levels. If the results of the blood and urine tests show high levels of aldosterone, the doctor may recommend a CT scan (see page 112), an MRI (see page 113), or a radionuclide scan (see page 114) to look for a tumor that could be causing the disorder.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Aldosteronism > *Treatment*]\nIf aldosteronism is caused by an adrenal tumor, the doctor may recommend surgery to remove the tumor, which often cures the disorder. If aldosteronism is not caused by a tumor, the doctor will prescribe medications to block the action of aldosterone and control high blood pressure. If drug treatment is not effective, the doctor may recommend surgery to remove part of the adrenal glands to reduce production of aldosterone. In rare cases, both adrenal glands are removed.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Aldosteronism > **Pheochromocytoma**]\nPheochromocytoma is a very rare condition in which a noncancerous tumor in the core of an adrenal gland (the adrenal medulla) causes the gland to produce too much epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones, which are produced in the adrenal medulla, work with the nervous system to control heart rate and blood pressure.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptoms of pheochromocytoma are significantly elevated blood pressure and a rapid, pounding heartbeat. Other symptoms may include light-headedness; pale, cold, and clammy skin; excessive sweating; rapid breathing; and chest pain. Some people may experience numbness and tingling in the hands, faintness, severe headaches, constipation, nausea and vomiting, or visual disturbances.\n\nThe elevated blood pressure may be persistent, or it may come and go along with other symptoms. The symptoms can be triggered by pressure on the tumor, medication, mild physical exertion, exposure to cold temperatures, or mild stress.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is based on the symptoms and the results of blood and urine tests that measure the levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine. If the blood and urine tests show an excess of these hormones, the doctor may recommend a CT scan (see page 112), an MRI (see page 113), or radionuclide scanning (see page 114) to locate the tumor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTo treat pheochromocytoma, a doctor performs surgery to remove the tumor, which usually cures the disorder. Before surgery, the doctor may prescribe a combination of the blood pressure medications alpha blockers and beta blockers to lower the person's blood pressure.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Thyroid and Parathyroid Glands]\nThe thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the lower part of the neck, directly in front of the trachea (windpipe). The thyroid has two lobes that are joined by a thin strand of thyroid tissue called the isthmus. Under the control of thyrotropin (also called thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH), which is produced by the pituitary gland, the thyroid gland produces thyroid hormones that control the speed of metabolism (the chemical processes that take place\n\nin the body). In general, the higher the level of thyroid hormones in the blood, the faster the speed of metabolism. To produce thyroid hormones, the thyroid needs an adequate supply of iodine, which comes from food (especially fish and iron-fortified products) and water.\n\nAt each of the four corners of the thyroid gland, but unrelated to the thyroid gland itself, are four parathyroid glands, each about the size of a pea. The parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone, which works with a thyroid hormone called calcitonin and vitamin D to control the level of calcium in the blood. Calcium is essential for healthy bones and teeth and has a significant role in the functioning of nerves and muscles. Parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, and vitamin D raise the calcium level in the blood in several ways\b\b\bby causing the intestines to absorb more calcium from food, by causing the body to excrete less calcium in urine, and by causing calcium to be released from bone tissue.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "aldosterone", "relation": "produces", "tail": "high blood pressure"}, {"head": "tumor in one adrenal gland", "relation": "causes", "tail": "Aldosteronism"}, {"head": "enlargement of both adrenal glands", "relation": "causes", "tail": "Aldosteronism"}, {"head": "underlying disease or condition", "relation": "causes", "tail": "Aldosteronism"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "kidneys", "relation": "reduces blood flow through", "tail": "[Event: congestive heart failure]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "experiences", "tail": "[Event: increased thirst and frequent urination]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: tumor in one adrenal gland]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: Conn's syndrome]"}, {"head": "[Event: enlargement of both adrenal glands]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: Aldosteronism]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Although these drugs will quickly relieve your symptoms, they will not affect the level of thyroid hormones in the blood.\n\nTo treat hyperthyroidism, along with the beta blockers, the doctor will probably prescribe antithyroid medications, which decrease the thyroid gland's production of thyroid hormones. In most cases, these drugs will control the disorder within about 8 weeks, but you will need to continue taking them—sometimes for a year or longer—\n\nuntil your doctor tells you to stop. Although the blood level of thyroid hormones may quickly return to normal, it may take several weeks for all of the symptoms to improve. The doctor also may prescribe corticosteroid medications to lower the blood level of thyroid hormones and reduce inflammation. Although some people are eventually cured with drug treatment, in most people, symptoms recur and additional treatment is required.\n\nFollowing treatment with antithyroid drugs, the doctor may perform surgery to remove either a lump in the thyroid gland or, if it is overactive, most of the thyroid gland. In most cases, surgery cures the disorder. However, in rare cases, the disease recurs or the thyroid or parathyroid glands become underactive (hypothyroidism; see next page) as a result of the surgery. In such cases, doctors usually prescribe corticosteroids.\n\nFor some people, doctors may recommend treatment with radioactive iodine. In this procedure, the person swallows a small dose of radioactive iodine in the form of a clear, slightly salty liquid. Because iodine is an essential component of some thyroid hormones, the radioactive material concentrates in the thyroid gland, where it acts on the glandular tissue to slowly control the overactivity without exposing the rest of the body to radiation. In some cases, the thyroid gland may become underactive, and you may have to take medication to treat this condition.\n\nEach treatment has advantages and disadvantages, and your doctor will work with you to determine the best course for you. With successful treatment, most people who have hyperthyroidism are able to lead a healthy, active life.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Hypothyroidism]\nHypothyroidism is a common disorder in which the thyroid gland is underactive and does not produce enough thyroid hormones. As a result, all the chemical processes in the body slow down. The severe form of hypothyroidism is called myxedema. Hypothyroidism affects women more frequently than men.\n\nThe thyroid gland may become underactive for one of several reasons. Occasionally, treatment for hyperthyroidism (see page 901), which attempts to reduce production of thyroid hormones, causes an overactive thyroid gland to become underactive. A deficiency of thyrotropin, which regulates the activity of the thyroid gland, is another possible cause of hypothyroidism.\n\nBecause the hypothalamus controls the production of thyrotropin by the pituitary gland, a disorder in either gland can lead to a deficiency of this hormone. Without an\n\nadequate supply of thyrotropin, the thyroid gland cannot function properly. Hypothyroidism may also result from Hashimoto's disease (see page 928), an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, reducing or blocking the production of thyroid hormone. In some cases, the thyroid gland becomes underactive for no apparent reason.\n\nRarely, a child is born with a defective thyroid gland or without a thyroid gland, and has hypothyroidism (see page 404). If not detected and treated promptly, the condition can lead to short stature and irreversible mental retardation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of hypothyroidism develop slowly, over the course of many months or years. People who have hypothyroidism usually experience a combination of some of the following symptoms:\n\n- Fatigue\n- Slow heart rate\n- Hoarseness\n- Slowed speech\n- Puffy face\n- Constipation\n- Confusion\n- Depression\n- Dementia\n- Increased sensitivity to cold\n- Decreased appetite combined with weight gain\n- Drooping eyelids\n- Dry hair\n- Dry, scaly, thick skin\n- Heavy, prolonged menstrual periods\n- Loss of sexual desire\n- Hearing loss\n- Numbness and tingling in the hands and arms\n- Drowsiness\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA diagnosis of hypothyroidism is based on the symptoms and a physical examination. The doctor will recommend blood tests to measure blood levels of thyrotropin and antithyroid antibodies (infection-fighting proteins that would indicate an autoimmune response).

Other possible symptoms are drowsiness, fatigue, depression, confusion, or seizures. Some people experience nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, flatulence, or constipation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose hyperparathyroidism, a doctor will order blood tests to measure the levels of calcium, phosphorus (a mineral that has an essential role in bone formation), and parathyroid hormone in the blood. In some cases, the doctor may recommend an ultrasound scan (see page 111) or a radionuclide scan (see page 114) to determine which of the four parathyroid glands is causing the problem. Hyperparathyroidism can also be detected by genetic analysis to look for a rare genetic disorder called multiple endocrine neoplasia, which can lead to cancer.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe usual treatment for hyperparathyroidism is surgical removal of a tumor if there is one, or of three of the four enlarged parathyroid glands. After surgery, the person may develop hypoparathyroidism (see next article), in which the parathyroid glands do not produce enough parathyroid hormone; he or she will then be treated for that condition.\n\nIf hyperparathyroidism causes kidney stones to form, a doctor may recommend treatment with extracorporeal lithotripsy (see page 816), a procedure in which shock waves pulverize the stones into a powder that can be passed out of the body in urine. Kidney stones also can be removed surgically.\n\nMedications called bisphosphonates can help prevent bone loss resulting from hyperparathyroidism. Scientists are currently developing medications to prevent the parathyroid glands from secreting too much parathyroid hormone.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Hypoparathyroidism**]\nHypoparathyroidism is a rare disorder in which the parathyroid glands are underactive and do not produce enough parathyroid hormone. Along with vitamin D and a hormone\n\ncalled calcitonin produced by the thyroid gland, parathyroid hormone regulates the levels of calcium in the body. A deficiency of parathyroid hormone leads to low levels of calcium in the blood and in the tissues, which can affect the functioning of muscles and nerves. Hypoparathyroidism can occur alone or along with problems in other endocrine glands, such as the thyroid gland or the adrenal glands.\n\nHypoparathyroidism usually results when tissue is removed from the parathyroid glands in surgery performed to control hyperparathyroidism (overactivity of the parathyroid glands; see previous page). The disorder also can result from surgery performed on the thyroid gland to control overactivity of the thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism; see page 901) or to remove a cancerous tumor. In some cases, hypoparathyroidism has no obvious cause.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptom of hypoparathyroidism is uncontrollable, painful, cramplike spasms in the face, hands, arms, and feet. Other symptoms include numbness and tingling in the face and hands, dry skin, and thinning hair. In rare cases, a person may have seizures. People who have hypoparathyroidism often develop a yeast infection in the mouth called oral thrush (see page 744). Women who have the disorder are susceptible to developing vaginal yeast infections (see page 880).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nHypoparathyroidism is diagnosed by the symptoms and the results of a blood test to measure the level of parathyroid hormone in the blood. Low levels of parathyroid hormone indicate that the parathyroid glands are underactive.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTo quickly relieve the painful muscle spasms caused by hypoparathyroidism, your doctor will recommend intravenous injections of calcium. You will need to take calcium and vitamin D supplements for the rest of your life to help maintain normal levels of calcium in your body and to prevent symptoms of calcium deficiency. Your doctor will examine you and perform blood tests on a regular basis to evaluate the effectiveness of your treatment and to monitor the level of calcium in your blood.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Immune System]\nYour immune system is an elaborate system of proteins, cells, organs, and ducts that protects your body from infection by invading microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi. When one of these microorganisms enters your body, white blood cells recognize it as foreign and move in to get rid of it. During this process, the white blood cells form a memory of a specific protein—called an antigen—that sits on the surface of the invading microorganism. This memory allows your immune system to recognize the microorganism in the future if you are exposed to it again. Doctors call this memory-forming ability immunity.\n\nProtective immunity keeps you from developing some infections, such as measles, more than once. Your body recognizes the microorganism when it invades again and respon", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "hyperparathyroidism", "relation": "can include", "tail": "muscle aches"}, {"head": "hyperparathyroidism", "relation": "can include", "tail": "muscle weakness"}, {"head": "hyperparathyroidism", "relation": "can include", "tail": "frequent urination"}, {"head": "hyperparathyroidism", "relation": "are", "tail": "drowsiness"}, {"head": "hyperparathyroidism", "relation": "are", "tail": "fatigue"}, {"head": "hyperparathyroidism", "relation": "are", "tail": "depression"}, {"head": "hyperparathyroidism", "relation": "are", "tail": "confusion"}, {"head": "hyperparathyroidism", "relation": "are", "tail": "seizures"}, {"head": "hyperparathyroidism", "relation": "can also be", "tail": "nausea and vomiting"}, {"head": "hyperparathyroidism", "relation": "can also be", "tail": "abdominal pain"}, {"head": "hyperparathyroidism", "relation": "can also be", "tail": "flatulence"}, {"head": "hyperparathyroidism", "relation": "can also be", "tail": "constipation"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "will order", "tail": "[Event: blood tests]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "may recommend", "tail": "[Event: ultrasound scan]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "may recommend", "tail": "[Event: radionuclide scan]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: blood tests]", "relation": "to determine", "tail": "[Event: diagnosis]"}, {"head": "[Event: ultrasound scan]", "relation": "to determine", "tail": "[Event: diagnosis]"}, {"head": "[Event: radionuclide scan]", "relation": "to determine", "tail": "[Event: diagnosis]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Lymph nodes contain infection-fighting white blood cells called lymphocytes, which circulate throughout the body among the blood, lymph nodes, and lymphatic vessels and are always on guard against potentially harmful microorganisms. The lymphatic vessels carry lymphocytes from the lymph nodes into the bloodstream and deliver lymphocytes into the lymph nodes from the bloodstream.\n\n![Diagram of a lymph node showing the structure of a lymphatic vessel.

By destroying cells that are part of the body's immune system, HIV progressively disables the body's ability to fight infection and some types of cancer. People infected with HIV often develop life-threatening infections that are called opportunistic because they seize the chance presented by the impaired immune system to take hold in the body. Such infections usually do not make healthy people sick.\n\nHIV is a retrovirus, which means that, unlike other viruses that carry DNA as their hereditary material, HIV carries RNA. Retroviruses reproduce by turning their RNA into DNA using an enzyme called reverse transcriptase. When a retrovirus such as HIV infects a cell, it inserts its RNA into the cell along with reverse transcriptase. The resulting DNA contains the genetic instructions that allow the virus to replicate. HIV belongs to a subgroup of retroviruses called “slow” viruses. Infection by a slow virus is characterized by a long period—sometimes decades—between initial infection and the appearance of symptoms. Worldwide, roughly 40 million people are living with HIV; about 48 percent of adults infected with HIV are women.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > HIV Infection and AIDS > HIV]\nHIV is a microscopic spherical retrovirus. Its RNA, which contains its genetic information, resides inside a protective coating made up of proteins. HIV uses an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to convert its RNA into DNA inside the host cell it invades and uses the host DNA to make copies of itself.\n\n![Diagram of a retrovirus (HIV) showing its structure. Labeled parts include: Surface proteins, Central core, Protein coating containing genetic material, Reverse transcriptase, and Outer envelope.]()![](_page_1672_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nHIV infection gradually impairs the functioning of the immune system by disabling and killing specialized immune system cells called CD4-positive T cells, or helper T cells, that signal other cells in the immune system to perform their special functions. Healthy people have 800 to 1,200 helper T cells per cubic millimeter ( $\\text{mm}^3$ ) of blood. After HIV infection, the number of helper T cells gradually decreases. When the number of helper T cells falls below 200 cells per  $\\text{mm}^3$ , the affected person becomes especially vulnerable to opportunistic infections, such as some specific types of pneumonia and cancer.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > HIV Infection and AIDS > How HIV Infects a Helper T Cell]\nWhen a particle of HIV encounters a CD4-positive T cell, it recognizes it by a molecule called a CD4 receptor on the cell's surface. The HIV particle binds with the CD4-positive T cell, which enables the HIV particle to enter the cell. Inside the cell, HIV converts its RNA into DNA. The newly made viral DNA enters the cell's nucleus, where it is spliced into the host cell's DNA. This processed HIV then moves out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm of the cell, where it uses the cell's protein-making machinery to make copies of itself. Once these new viral particles leave the cell, they become infectious and search for other CD4-positive T cells to invade.\n\nPeople can become infected with HIV through contact with infected blood or other body fluids, usually by having unprotected sex with an infected partner or by sharing contaminated needles. Infected women can spread HIV to their babies during pregnancy\n\nor childbirth. Infected mothers can also transmit HIV to their babies in breast milk. Having a sexually transmitted disease (see page 477)—such as syphilis, genital herpes, or gonorrhea—makes a person more vulnerable to HIV infection during unprotected sex. HIV is not transmitted through casual contact, such as sharing towels or bedding, telephones, or toilet seats. It has not been shown that biting insects, such as mosquitoes or bedbugs, transmit", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "lymphocytes", "relation": "contain", "tail": "infection-fighting white blood cells"}, {"head": "lymph nodes", "relation": "play a major role in", "tail": "the body's immune response"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

Allergies, also known as acquired sensitivities, occur on the second or subsequent exposures to specific substances.\n\nTo keep you healthy, your immune system normally recognizes and destroys invading microorganisms, such as viruses and bacteria, through a complicated process called the immune response. First, the immune system produces proteins called antibodies, which attach themselves to specialized cells called mast cells that are present in most body tissues. The antibodies and mast cells attack the invading microorganisms by bonding to antigens (proteins) on their surface. This bond stimulates the mast cells to release a number of strong chemicals. One of these chemicals, called histamine, irritates the surrounding tissue, causing the redness, swelling, and itching characteristic of inflammation. In people who have allergies, this process is triggered by harmless substances, such as mold or animal dander (tiny skin flakes), rather than by disease-causing microorganisms. A substance that causes an allergic reaction is referred to as an allergen.\n\nYou can have an allergic reaction to anything that you inhale or eat, or to something that comes in contact with your skin. You can also have an allergic reaction to medications or to wasp or bee venom.\n\nIf you think you may have an allergy, talk to your doctor, who will either treat you or refer you to an allergist (a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating allergies). The specific substance that is triggering your allergy may be difficult to identify. Laboratory tests can help determine whether you have an allergy and identify the substance that is causing the reaction. Be sure to tell any new doctor you see about your allergy and any medications you are taking to treat it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Allergies > An allergic reaction]\nDuring an allergic reaction, the immune system responds to a normally harmless substance as if it were a harmful invader. During the first exposure to the substance (referred to as an allergen), the immune system produces antibodies that attach themselves to cells called mast cells. The next time the allergen enters the body, it bonds with the antibodies. This bond stimulates\n\nthe mast cells to release many powerful chemicals, including histamine. The release of these chemicals from the mast cells causes the characteristic symptoms of an allergic reaction.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the process of an allergic reaction. An allergen binds to antibodies on the surface of a Mast cell. The Mast cell then releases histamine, which causes the characteristic symptoms of an allergic reaction.

In a scratch test, a small amount of the suspected allergen is pricked or scratched into the skin. A safer alternative (which reduces the risk of the allergen getting into the bloodstream) is a patch test, in which the suspected allergen is applied to a patch taped to the skin. Skin testing, especially scratch testing, is not usually performed on anyone who has had a life-threatening reaction to an allergen or who has a skin disorder (such as dermatitis) that could affect the results of the test. Any reaction (such as redness, swelling, or itching) usually indicates an allergic reaction to the substance being tested.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosing Allergies > *RAST Blood Test*]\nThe radioallergosorbent test (RAST) is the blood test most frequently used to detect all types of allergens. It can help identify the substance that is causing your allergic reaction by measuring the level of IgE antibodies in your blood after exposure to the substance. (IgE antibodies are proteins the body produces in most allergic reactions.) RAST can be done even if you are taking medications for the allergy or if you are having symptoms (such as dermatitis) that could alter the results of skin tests. A positive test result usually means that you are allergic to the substance being tested.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Treating Allergies]\nThe best treatment for any allergy is complete avoidance of the allergen. Sometimes it is possible to make an affected person less sensitive to an allergen in a process called desensitization. Desensitization is sometimes used to treat the symptoms of airborne allergies such as pollen or dust mites, and severe reactions to wasp or bee stings.

Symptoms that are present all year are more likely to indicate an allergy to airborne substances found indoors, such as mold, animal dander, or dust mites. Your doctor may use skin tests (see page 912) or a blood test (RAST; see previous page) to determine what allergens are causing your symptoms. The doctor may take a sample of your nasal secretions for examination under a microscope to measure the number of eosinophils in your nose. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that increases in number during an allergic reaction. Your doctor may also examine your nose for polyps (see page 634), which can cause symptoms similar to those of allergies.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nBecause pollens and other airborne allergens are hard to avoid, your doctor may recommend over-the-counter antihistamines, which relieve symptoms by blocking the action of the histamine-releasing cells that produce the allergic symptoms. However, to be fully effective, antihistamines have to be taken regularly (usually daily for several years). Some people find the side effects of antihistamines, such as drowsiness and dryness in the nose and throat, more annoying than the allergy.\n\nOther types of over-the-counter drugs may provide some relief. An over-the-counter nasal spray containing the medication cromolyn is about half as effective as prescribed corticosteroid nasal sprays but is much safer to use for long periods. Saline (salt solution) nose sprays can help clear the nose of airborne allergens. Doctors generally do not recommend decongestant nose drops or sprays because they can worsen symptoms, and they need to be taken more and more frequently to get the same effect. Take decongestants only if your doctor prescribes them and then only for short periods.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Hay Fever]\nHay fever, or allergic rhinitis, is a type of seasonal allergy caused by contact with the light, easily blown pollen of grasses (such as Kentucky blue-grass), trees (such as oak, ash, and elm), and weeds (such as ragweed). Most people experience symptoms in the spring or fall, but exactly when a plant pollinates depends on its geographic location. Weather conditions don't affect the amount of pollen but influence the amount that gets distributed. For example, pollen counts are highest on warm, dry days and lowest on cold, wet days. If you have hay fever, stay indoors as much as possible with the windows closed when you are having symptoms or when pollen counts are high. Use air-conditioning and heating systems with built-in filters (smaller air-filtering machines may not be effective). Resist rubbing your eyes, which can make the irritation worse.\n\nIf over-the-counter medications don't relieve your symptoms, your doctor may prescribe an antihistamine that doesn't cause drowsiness. Eyedrops prescribed by your doctor can temporarily relieve eye irritation. Corticosteroid nasal sprays work well to relieve nasal congestion and the trickle of nasal secretions down the back of the throat (called post-nasal drip). In rare cases, a doctor may also prescribe medications usually used to treat asthma—such as bronchodilators (see page 641) to open the airways, or corticosteroids taken by mouth or through an inhaler to reduce inflammation. If these medications don't control the symptoms or if they cause adverse reactions, desensitization (see page 913) therapy may be recommended.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Allergies to Food]\nA food allergy is an allergic reaction to particular foods or food additives. The reaction usually occurs immediately or within a few hours after eating. In celiac disease (see page 768), in which the small intestine is hypersensitive to the protein gluten, the reaction may not occur until days later. Food allergies can last a lifetime, but many food allergies diagnosed in childhood disappear as the child gets older. The most common foods that cause allergies are nuts (especially peanuts, walnuts, and Brazil nuts), legumes (such as soybeans), fish and shellfish (especially whitefish and shrimp), cow's milk, egg whites, and wheat. Food allergies tend to run in families.\n\nSome people have abnormal reactions (such as indigestion; see page 749) to certain foods or beverages, but these reactions are not allergic because they don't involve the immune system. Lactose intolerance (see page 770) is an adverse reaction (but not an allergic reaction) to dairy products. Some substances, including sulfites in wine or monosodium glutamate (MSG) in food, can cause chemical disturbances in the body but are not true allergens.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nOnce the allergy-causing food is absorbed into the bloodstream, it can react with antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) in the blood vessels, causing headaches, rashes, itching and swelling in the throat and around the lips and mouth, a stuffy or runny nose, or sh", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "use", "tail": "skin tests"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "perform", "tail": "blood test"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "take", "tail": "nasal secretions sample"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "determine", "tail": "[Event: what allergens are causing symptoms]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "examine", "tail": "[Event: nasal secretions under microscope]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "examine", "tail": "[Event: nose for polyps]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: allergic reaction]", "relation": "cause", "tail": "[Event: increase in eosinophils]"}, {"head": "[Event: symptoms of allergy to airborne substances found indoors]", "relation": "lead to", "tail": "[Event: doctor may use skin tests or blood test]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Drugs that are injected into a muscle or through a vein are most likely to cause allergic reactions because they enter the bloodstream directly. The medications that most often cause allergic reactions are penicillin and similar antibiotics. Oral medications are less likely to cause a reaction because some of the potential allergens are broken down during the digestion process. Many medications cause adverse reactions, or unwanted side effects, but because these reactions don't involve the immune system, they are not considered to be allergic reactions.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nThe symptoms of an allergic reaction to medication include rash, wheezing, or shortness of breath. If the symptoms are severe, they can lead to a life-threatening condition called anaphylactic shock (see left).\n\nTo diagnose an allergy to a medication, a doctor evaluates the person's symptoms to make sure that they are not merely side effects of the medication. He or she will perform a blood test (RAST; see page 913) and skin tests (see page 912) to determine the cause and severity of the allergic reaction.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nDrug allergies can be treated in two ways. Avoiding the medication is the best treatment if the medication can be safely discontinued or if your doctor can substitute another drug. If you must have the drug that causes an allergic reaction and the reaction is relatively mild, your doctor may be able to treat the symptoms of the allergic reaction with another drug, such as an antihistamine or corticosteroid, to reduce inflammation.\n\nBe sure to tell any other doctors you see about your drug allergy so they won't prescribe it for you. Wear a medical identification necklace or bracelet that specifies the type of medication to which you are allergic.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Autoimmune Disorders]\nWhen bacteria or viruses attack your body, your immune system defends you from these invaders by detecting and killing them. But if your immune system is not working properly, it can mistake your body's own cells for foreign invaders and attack them. This process—the immune system attacking itself—is called autoimmunity. Doctors have not yet discovered exactly why the immune system treats some parts of the body as harmful invaders, but they think that certain people have a genetic predisposition to autoimmunity. Such susceptible people develop an autoimmune disorder when they are exposed to an environmental trigger such as an infection, certain drugs, or, in some women, pregnancy.\n\nAn autoimmune disorder can affect almost any part of the body, and the specific symptoms depend on which organs are targeted. But when the immune system attacks, it almost always produces inflammation, and this inflammation can damage the body. Autoimmune disorders are unpredictable. In some people they last for a few months or years and then go away on their own. Other people experience periodic flare-ups—times when symptoms get worse—followed by intervals during which they feel better. Still others have a disorder that is active most of the time, lasts for years, and causes severe damage.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Autoimmune Disorders > Autoimmune disorders affect many parts of the body]\nAutoimmune disorders cause the immune system to mistakenly attack cells and organs in the body as if they were invading microorganisms. Many different parts of the body can be affected. Some autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, affect only specific parts of the body, such as the joints, while others are systemic, affecting the entire body. For example, some forms of lupus can cause serious damage to the lungs, heart, kidneys, and brain.\n\nDiagram illustrating various systemic autoimmune diseases affecting different organs and tissues in the human body:\n\n- Tear ducts (Sjögren's syndrome)\n- Salivary glands (Sjögren's syndrome)\n- Thyroid gland (Hashimoto's disease)\n- Lungs (lupus; sarcoidosis)\n- Stomach (pernicious anemia)\n- Adrenal glands (Addison's disease)\n- Pancreas (type 1 diabetes)\n- Kidneys (lupus)\n- Skin (scleroderma)\n- Colon (inflammatory bowel disease)\n- Muscle (dermatomyositis)\n- Joints (rheumatoid arthritis)\n\n![](_page_1688_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Rheumatoid Arthritis]\nRheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation, pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of function in the joints. In rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system attacks the membrane called the synovium, which lines joints. The synovium becomes inflamed, causing joint pain, warmth, redness, and swelling. The cells of the synovium begin to grow and divide abnormally, and start to invade and destroy the cartilage and bone inside the joint. The surrounding muscles, ligaments, and tendons become weak and unable to support the joint.

No single test exists for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis, and the symptoms can vary dramatically from person to person. The symptoms can mimic those of other joint problems, which the doctor will want to rule out. In addition, only a few symptoms may be present in the initial stages of rheumatoid arthritis, forcing the doctor to wait for the full range of symptoms to appear before confirming the diagnosis. For these reasons, doctors use a variety of tools to help make a diagnosis.\n\nA thorough health history—your description of your symptoms and how they began—will help your doctor evaluate your condition and learn how it changes over time. Your doctor will also perform a physical examination of your joints, skin, reflexes, and muscle strength.\n\nThe doctor will probably order a blood test to detect rheumatoid factor, an antibody your immune system may have mistakenly produced. Rheumatoid factor is present in the blood of most—but not all—people with rheumatoid arthritis. Other diagnostic blood tests are often performed to detect inflammation, white blood cells, and anemia, which are often present with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nIn later stages of the disease, doctors use X-rays of the joints to monitor the progression of joint damage.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nDoctors use many different types of treatment to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and slow joint damage in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Some lifestyle activities—including a balanced program of rest when the disorder is active and exercise when symptoms subside—can help improve joint function. For example, swimming in a heated pool is good for stiff joints. Removable splints that you can strap onto your painful joints when they need rest, and self-help devices such as zipper pullers and bathroom safety bars, can help reduce the stress on painful joints. Using relaxation techniques (see page 59) to relieve emotional stress can help make living with rheumatoid arthritis a little easier. Your doctor may recommend that you apply heat to the affected joints and may refer you to a physical therapist, who can teach you some helpful exercises and provide splints for affected joints.\n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were traditionally the mainstays of rheumatoid arthritis treatment in the early stages, and more powerful drugs were reserved for later, more severe stages. This approach has now been reversed, in the belief that stronger drugs taken early might prevent or limit additional joint damage. Drugs currently used to treat rheumatoid arthritis include hydroxy-chloroquine, sulfasalazine, and methotrexate. These drugs are powerful enough to interrupt the process that produces inflammation by blocking the interactions between immune system cells. A promising new class of genetically engineered drugs called tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are proving effective in both limiting inflammation and slowing the destruction of cartilage and bone, with few side effects.\n\nSurgery can be helpful in the management of rheumatoid arthritis for relieving pain and improving joint function. Three types of surgery are available: joint replacement surgery (see page 999), reconstruction of affected tendons (most often in the hands), and synovectomy, in which the inflamed tissue of the synovium is completely removed.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Systemic Lupus Erythematosus]\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (usually referred to simply as lupus) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the skin, joints, muscles, and many other organs in the body. Lupus develops primarily in women during their childbearing years but can also affect men. In people with lupus, the immune system attacks multiple body systems, causing inflammation that damages organs and tissues.\n\nThere are three main types of lupus—systemic lupus, discoid lupus, and drug-induced systemic lupus. Systemic lupus, the most common type, produces inflammation in multiple body systems. Discoid lupus erythematosus (see page 1072) produces only a skin rash characterized by crusty skin patches on the face, neck, or chest that may scar. Drug-induced systemic lupus can be triggered by a wide variety of drugs, including beta blockers (see page 562) used for treating heart disease and high blood pressure. The drug-induced type of lupus disappears completely when the person stops taking the drug.\n\nSystemic lupus affects women about 10 times as often as men and usually develops between ages 18 and 45. Blacks and Hispanics have an increased risk of developing the disorder. Lupus occurs more often in first-degree relatives (children, siblings, or parents) of affected people than in the general population, indicating that genes play a role. In other cases, the cause is unknown.

To make a diagnosis of lupus, the doctor must see evidence of abnormalities in many different organs and body systems, including the skin, joints, kidneys, blood, lungs, nervous system, and the membranes lining the heart and other organs. The doctor obtains this evidence through a thorough physical examination and the person's description of his or\n\nher symptoms, including how and when they began. The doctor then looks for a relationship between the results of the physical examination and the person's symptoms.\n\nIf you have a number of the characteristic symptoms of lupus, the doctor will order blood and urine tests, as well as a series of specialized tests that evaluate how well your immune system is working. No one test can positively determine if a person has lupus but, taken together, the battery of laboratory tests can point to a diagnosis. In general, the tests are designed to detect the presence of autoantibodies (proteins that mistakenly identify cells in the body as invading harmful organisms and attack them). The most common tests used to diagnose lupus include:\n\n- Complete blood cell count\n- Liver and kidney screenings\n- Blood tests for specific autoantibodies\n- Urinalysis to detect kidney problems\n- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate to measure levels of inflammation\n- Chest X-rays to assess lung damage\n- ECG (electrocardiogram) to detect heart problems\n\nThe results of these tests will determine what further tests might be helpful.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTreatment for lupus depends on the severity of the disease, but most treatment plans use a combination of medications, exercise, rest, a nutritious diet, and protection from the sun. The medications doctors prescribe for lupus are designed to relieve pain and inflammation and suppress the immune system to dampen its abnormal response. The disease remains mild in about one third of all affected people, requiring only nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen. More severely affected people need to take corticosteroid drugs such as prednisone, by mouth or by injection into a muscle. Corticosteroids taken at high doses for long periods can produce changes in appearance, such as acne, a rounded face, a swollen abdomen, and weight gain. If you are taking corticosteroids, do not stop taking them suddenly or you could go into shock. Your doctor will gradually reduce the dosage for you.\n\n**Organs and tissues affected by systemic lupus** Systemic lupus affects the skin as well as other organs and tissues throughout the body, causing inflammation in the lungs, heart, kidneys, joints, and nervous system.\n\n![Diagram of a human body showing internal organs and systems. Labeled parts include: Nervous system, Skin, Heart, Lungs, Kidneys, and Joints.]()![](_page_1696_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nAntimalarial drugs were originally developed to treat malaria, but doctors soon found that they were also effective in relieving the joint pain and inflammation of lupus. Antimalarial drugs work especially well to relieve the skin rash that characterizes discoid lupus (which affects only the skin).\n\nUp to 60 percent of people with lupus are sensitive to sunlight. Exposure to sunlight can stimulate flare-ups or worsen lupus-induced skin rashes. It is very important for people with lupus to protect themselves from the sun by wearing clothing that blocks the sun's rays such as long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and wide-brimmed hats. Applying sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF 15 or above) half an hour before going outdoors will also help protect sensitive skin. Another way to minimize sun exposure is to avoid going out in the sun between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM, when the sun's rays are strongest.\n\nSeveral experimental treatments aimed at improving the function of the immune system have proven successful in treating lupus. Stem cell transplants (see page 624) are being tried in people with severe lupus, with promising results. People with end-stage kidney failure require treatment with kidney dialysis (see page 818) or a kidney transplant (see page 820); a person with lupus can have a transplant only when the disease is inactive.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Scleroderma]\nScleroderma (which means hard skin) is a chronic autoimmune disorder in which the immune system mistakenly produces antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) that attack connective tissue throughout the body. The disorder is characterized by an overproduction of the protein collagen in the body's connective tissue, which results in thickening, hardening, and tightening of the skin, especially of the hands and face. There are two main types of scleroderma—localized (which affects only the skin and musculoskeletal system) and systemic (which causes a more widespread hardening of the skin and also affects internal organs, including the lungs", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "must see", "tail": "evidence of abnormalities"}, {"head": "blood and urine tests", "relation": "will order", "tail": "characteristic symptoms of lupus"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "obtains", "tail": "[Event: thorough physical examination]"}, {"head": "person", "relation": "description", "tail": "[Event: description of symptoms]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "looks for", "tail": "[Event: relationship between results and symptoms]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: thorough physical examination]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: diagnosis of lupus]"}, {"head": "[Event: description of symptoms]", "relation": "helps with", "tail": "[Event: diagnosis of lupus]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Polymyositis is a rare, chronic disorder that is characterized by inflammation of many muscles throughout the body. The disorder can occur at any age but is most common in children between ages 5 and 15 and in adults between ages 40 and 60.\n\nPolymyositis occurs twice as often in women as in men. The cause of the disorder is unknown, but doctors think it is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system mistakenly produces antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) that attack muscle tissues. In some cases, the disorder may be linked to some types of cancer (such as lung cancer). For reasons that are not fully understood, the normal, helpful antibodies the immune system has produced to attack the cancer cells also mistakenly attack the muscles. If polymyositis produces a skin rash, doctors call the disorder dermatomyositis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptom of polymyositis is muscle weakness, especially in the shoulders, upper arms, hips, and thighs. The muscle weakness may occur suddenly, without\n\nwarning, or develop gradually over weeks or months. As the muscles weaken, you become less able to perform routine activities such as bathing, dressing, getting up from a chair, climbing stairs, or walking. Other symptoms of the disorder include muscle pain, joint pain and swelling, fever, fatigue, and weight loss. If polymyositis affects the lungs, it can cause shortness of breath and a persistent cough. If the disorder affects the muscles of the throat and esophagus, you can have difficulty swallowing and speaking. In addition to the characteristic symptoms of polymyositis, dermatomyositis produces a reddish rash on the face, shoulders, elbows, knuckles, knees, and ankles. In many cases, the symptoms of polymyositis and dermatomyositis come and go.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose polymyositis or dermatomyositis, your doctor will ask about your symptoms, take a health history, and perform a physical examination. The doctor may recommend a muscle biopsy, in which a sample of muscle tissue is surgically removed and examined under a microscope. Blood tests that measure the levels of specific enzymes (proteins that promote or accelerate chemical reactions in the body) and antibodies produced by people with the disorder are also helpful in making a diagnosis. The doctor will probably order an electromyogram (an evaluation of the electrical activity of the muscles) and, in some cases, screening tests for cancer. He or she also may recommend an examination by a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in treating disorders of the joints, muscles, and connective tissues) or a neurologist (a doctor who specializes in treating disorders of the nervous system) to rule out other disorders.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIn some cases, polymyositis or dermatomyositis disappears on its own without treatment and does not return. However, in most cases, a doctor has to treat the disorder with high doses of a corticosteroid medication such as prednisone (taken by mouth) to relieve the inflammation, swelling, and pain. As the symptoms improve, the doctor will gradually reduce the dose, but most people will need to take low doses of corticosteroids for many years and, in some cases, for the rest of their lives to control the disorder. Corticosteroids usually are not an effective treatment for polymyositis or dermatomyositis that has been triggered by cancer.\n\nIf treatment with corticosteroids does not work, the doctor will probably prescribe immune-suppressing drugs (drugs that curb the abnormal activity of the immune system),\n\nsuch as methotrexate or azathioprine, in combination with or instead of the corticosteroids. If corticosteroids and immune-suppressing drugs are not effective in relieving the symptoms, the doctor may prescribe gamma globulin (the pooled antibodies of healthy donors) given intravenously (through a vein).\n\nYour doctor will recommend that you get plenty of rest and limit activity when your symptoms flare up. He or she will work with you to develop a program of regular moderate exercise to help improve and maintain your flexibility, strength, and endurance.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Raynaud's Disease and Raynaud's Phenomenon]\nRaynaud's disease is a disorder in which the capillaries (the smallest blood vessels) in the skin constrict, reducing blood flow to the fingers and toes. In some cases, the nose, lips, and earlobes are also affected. The cause of Raynaud's disease is unknown, but doctors think it may be an autoimmune disorder, in which the immune system mistakenly produces antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) that attack the body's own tissues. Episodes of Raynaud's disease are usually triggered by exposure to cold air or cold water or by stress.

The disorder can affect glands in other parts of the body as well, causing dryness in the nose, throat, airways, skin, stomach, pancreas, intestines, or vagina. When the disorder extends beyond the moisture-producing glands it can affect the whole body, including the joints, lungs, kidneys, blood vessels, and nervous system.\n\nThere are two types of Sjögren's syndrome—primary and secondary. The primary form appears by itself, and the secondary form occurs along with another autoimmune disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis (see page 918) or systemic lupus erythematosus (see page 920). People with the secondary type are likely to have more health problems than people with primary Sjögren's syndrome.\n\nPeople who develop Sjögren's syndrome probably have a genetic susceptibility to the disorder, but having a gene for the condition does not necessarily mean that you will develop the syndrome. Some sort of trigger must activate the immune system's faulty response; doctors think that this trigger may be a viral or bacterial infection. Once the infection stimulates the immune system to act, the suspected gene alters the immune system's response, sending fighter cells to the moisture-producing glands, where they cause inflammation that damages the glands. The fighter cells then continue their attack long after the infection has cleared up.\n\nSjögren's syndrome is one of the most prevalent of the autoimmune disorders, affecting people of all racial and ethnic groups. Roughly 2 million to 4 million people in the United States have the condition—about half with the primary type and half with the secondary type. Ninety percent of affected people are women, and the disorder most often first appears in a person's late 40s.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sjögren's Syndrome > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome usually develop slowly. If you have the disorder, you may notice that your eyes are dry, red, and itchy, and feel gritty. You may have blurred vision and be sensitive to bright light, especially fluorescent light. Your mouth will feel dry, making it difficult to swallow, speak, and taste. You may develop a dry cough. The lack of saliva makes you more vulnerable to developing cavities in your teeth and yeast infections in your mouth (thrush; see page 744). You may also have frequent nosebleeds. Intercourse may be painful because of vaginal dryness.\n\nSjögren's syndrome can affect your entire body, causing skin rashes, thyroid problems, joint and muscle pain, and pneumonia (if bacteria from the mouth migrate to the lungs). Nerve problems can cause numbness and tingling in the fingers and toes, carpal tunnel syndrome (see page 699), and loss of feeling in the face. Many people with the disorder experience extreme fatigue. Sjögren's syndrome can also cause poor kidney function, digestive problems, and connective tissue disorders. About 5 percent of people with Sjögren's syndrome go on to develop the blood cancer lymphoma (see page 625).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf you experience dry eyes and a dry mouth for more than 3 months, see your doctor for an evaluation. He or she will first take a detailed health history and ask you about your general health, your symptoms, and your family health history. After performing a complete physical examination, your doctor will order several tests of your eyes and mouth to check the severity of the dryness and determine if it has caused any damage.\n\nThe most effective test for detecting Sjögren's syndrome is called salivary gland biopsy of the lip. During this test, the doctor removes one of the tiny salivary glands from the inside of the lower lip and examines it under a microscope for a characteristic pattern of infection-fighting white blood cells, which indicates Sjögren's syndrome.\n\nYour doctor may decide to do additional tests to determine if any other parts of your body are affected. These tests may include blood tests, such as a complete blood cell count, a blood glucose test, and tests that check for the presence of the abnormal antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) that are commonly found in people with Sjögren's syndrome. The doctor may also order a chest X-ray to check for inflammation in the lungs and a urinalysis to determine how well your kidneys are functioning.\n\nMaking an accurate diagnosis can take time because the symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome are similar to those of a number of other diseases. In fact, the time from the first appearance of symptoms to diagnosis usually ranges from 2 to 8 years.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe treatment of Sjögren's syndrome depends on the extent of the problem and the particular symptoms a person has.

For some forms of vasculitis, no treatment is necessary. For other forms, only the symptoms can be treated. Treatments for vasculitis can range from taking over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroid drugs (for inflammation), to a procedure called plasmapheresis. Plasmapheresis removes potentially harmful inflammatory substances from the liquid part of the blood (plasma).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Hashimoto's Disease**]\nHashimoto's disease (also called Hashimoto's thyroiditis) is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland. Hashimoto's disease can lead to hypothyroidism (see page 903), a condition in which the thyroid gland becomes underactive and produces too little thyroxine, the thyroid hormone that regulates metabolism (all of the chemical processes that take place in the body). Although anyone can develop Hashimoto's disease, the disorder usually occurs in women between ages 30 and 50. The cause of Hashimoto's disease is unknown, but it tends to run in families.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nMany people who have Hashimoto's disease have no symptoms. Others may develop symptoms of hypothyroidism, including an enlarged thyroid gland, increased sensitivity to cold, high cholesterol, loss of appetite accompanied by weight gain, a slow heart rate, and fatigue. Symptoms can also include dry skin, brittle fingernails, swollen ankles, or constipation. Some people may also experience muscle stiffness or weakness, muscle cramps, memory problems, or depression.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo make a diagnosis of Hashimoto's disease, your doctor will take a health history, ask you to describe your symptoms, and perform a physical examination. The doctor will order blood tests to evaluate how well your thyroid gland is functioning and may recommend specialized blood tests to check for Hashimoto's disease.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > *Treatment*]\nIf Hashimoto's disease results in hypothyroidism, the doctor will prescribe synthetic thyroid hormone to relieve and control your symptoms. You will probably need to take the medication for the rest of your life. Your doctor will perform blood tests and physical examinations regularly to monitor your treatment and the functioning of your thyroid gland. He or she may need to adjust the dose of your medication from time to time, depending on your health and the results of the blood tests.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > **Polymyalgia Rheumatica**]\nPolymyalgia rheumatica is a disorder that causes pain and stiffness in large muscle groups, primarily in the neck, shoulders, and hips. The disorder, which usually occurs after age 50, affects twice as many women as men, and the incidence increases with age. The cause of the disorder is not known, but it may have a hereditary component. It seems to be an autoimmune disorder brought on by a faulty immune response that attacks muscle cells. About 15 percent of people who have polymyalgia rheumatica develop a type of vasculitis called temporal arteritis (see page 927), also known as giant cell arteritis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica are moderate to severe pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders, and hips, especially in the morning or after a period of inactivity. The pain and stiffness usually last longer than 30 minutes. Other symptoms may include slight fever, fatigue, depression, and weight loss. Symptoms of temporal arteritis include headaches, pain in the temples, jaw pain, and blurred or double vision. The disorder can lead to permanent blindness.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose polymyalgia rheumatica, a doctor will take a detailed health history and order blood tests. One of these diagnostic blood tests, called the elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, measures how fast red blood cells fall to the bottom of a test tube. Rapidly falling red blood cells signal inflammation in the body. Because polymyalgia rheumatica can resemble other conditions, the doctor will want to rule out any other illnesses by ordering additional blood tests. If you also have symptoms of temporal arteritis, the doctor will recommend a biopsy of one of the temporal arteries at the side of your head to look for abnormal cells in the artery walls.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nPolymyalgia rheumatica frequently disappears by itself after a year or longer. With treatment, symptoms are usually relieved within 48 hours. Depending on the severity of symptoms, the doctor may recommend taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen, or he or she may prescribe low doses of corticosteroid drugs, which are very effective in relieving symptoms.

The cause of this condition is not known. The blood clots form when abnormal antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) in the blood interact with cells in the blood or in blood vessels, stimulating them to form a clot. The disorder can be present in some people with autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (see page 920), rheumatoid arthritis (see page 918), or certain types of thyroid disease, but it can also occur in people who do not have an autoimmune disease.\n\nAntiphospholipid antibody syndrome also may appear during a bacterial or viral infection such as syphilis (see page 483) or Lyme disease (see page 942), and disappear after the infection goes away. The abnormal antibodies can even be present in people without a medical condition. Certain drugs—such as the epilepsy drug phenytoin, antibiotics, cocaine, and antimalarial drugs—also can cause antiphospholipid antibodies to be produced in the blood. Discontinuing the drug will stop the abnormal blood clotting.\n\nAntiphospholipid antibody syndrome carries special risks during pregnancy. Miscarriage early or late in pregnancy and stillbirth are common in women with the disorder. The placenta may be small and the fetus may have retarded growth. Affected women have an increased risk of a potentially dangerous condition called preeclampsia (see page 526)—a sudden increase in blood pressure, protein in the urine, or both during pregnancy. All pregnancies in women with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome are considered high-risk pregnancies.\n\nWomen with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome have an even higher risk of blood clots when taking birth-control pills, so they need to use other methods of birth control (see page 470). Smoking also dramatically raises the risk of blood clots in people who have the syndrome.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nIn a person with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, blood clots appear in the leg or arm veins and can travel to the lungs, causing a life-threatening pulmonary embolism\n\n(see page 606). Other common symptoms include sudden vision loss, numbness or weakness in the face or limbs, purplish discoloration of the skin, seizures, stroke, or recurring pregnancy loss. Multiple strokes can lead to dementia (see page 689). All of these symptoms result from blood clots that develop in small or medium blood vessels. People with the disorder usually experience only a few of these symptoms.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, the doctor will take a complete health history, perform a physical examination, and order a series of blood tests to detect abnormal blood clotting and the antiphospholipid antibodies. The most important of these tests are the lupus anticoagulant test and the anticardiolipin antibodies test.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe treatment of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is tailored to each person. The presence of blood clots requires anticoagulating medication such as heparin or warfarin, sometimes combined with aspirin. People with an autoimmune disorder may need to take corticosteroid drugs such as prednisone to suppress the abnormal immune system response.\n\nPregnant women with the disorder must also take medication to prevent blood clots in the veins that could travel to the brain or lungs. Baby aspirin, heparin, and immunoglobulin (human antibodies) are sometimes prescribed separately or in combination. Treatment during pregnancy significantly boosts the fetus's survival rate.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Chronic Fatigue Syndrome]\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) refers to a variety of symptoms that differ from person to person and can last for different lengths of time. People who have CFS generally have severe fatigue that is not improved by rest and that can worsen after physical or mental activity. Their level of activity is substantially lower than it was before the onset of the illness. The cause of CFS is not known, but doctors believe it may result from a combination of factors, including a viral infection, an abnormal immune response (possibly triggered by stress), or low blood pressure. In many cases, the symptoms of CFS last for months or even years.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nSome symptoms of CFS resemble those of viral infections, such as a sore throat, tender lymph nodes, muscle pain, joint pain (without swelling or redness), and headaches that are different than usual. A person who has CFS can also experience significant impairment in short-term memory or ability to concentrate, feeling tired even after sleeping for several hours, and fatigue that can last 24 hours after physical exertion. Some people develop psychological problems such as anxiety (see page 718) or depression (see page 709).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnos", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome", "relation": "can occur in", "tail": "people who do not have an autoimmune disease"}, {"head": "Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome", "relation": "is present in", "tail": "some people with autoimmune disorders"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "blood clots", "relation": "form when", "tail": "[Event: abnormal antibodies interact with cells]"}, {"head": "Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome", "relation": "may appear during", "tail": "[Event: bacterial or viral infection]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: blood clots form]", "relation": "are caused by", "tail": "[Event: abnormal antibodies interact with cells]"}, {"head": "[Event: Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome appears]", "relation": "is triggered by", "tail": "[Event: bacterial or viral infection]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Viruses cause infection by taking over the machinery of the cells they invade and making copies of themselves. In the process, the host cells are usually destroyed. The newly manufactured viruses invade other cells, continuing the cycle of multiplying inside the cells and destroying them. Viral infections may cause symptoms such as high fever, muscle pain, headache, and weakness. There are no effective treatments for most viruses, but some viral infections can be treated with antiviral drugs.\n\nBacteria live everywhere, including in and on the human body. Many types of bacteria are helpful in protecting the body from disease. They inhabit the skin and the mucous membranes that line the mouth, nose, intestines, and vagina, acting as barriers against potentially harmful invading microorganisms. Problems arise, however, when the beneficial bacteria in your body multiply in greater-than-normal numbers and cause infections or when harmful bacteria enter your body, such as through a cut in the skin or in food you eat. Some bacteria cause disease by producing toxins that damage cells.\n\nMost of the harmful bacteria can be eliminated with antibiotics. However, antibiotics must be used appropriately, only for bacterial infections, and exactly as the doctor prescribes. If you stop taking a course of antibiotics before you finish the prescription, you risk having a recurrence of the infection. If you take antibiotics frequently or intermittently, you risk allowing bacteria to grow that will be resistant to the effects of the antibiotic and therefore harder to eliminate. Antibiotic resistance can also result when antibiotics are taken for viral infections such as a cold. Antibiotics are not effective against viral infections.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Viruses and Bacteria > How viruses multiply]\nViruses cause infection by invading cells in the body and taking over the cells' internal machinery to make copies of themselves. The viruses usually destroy the host cells in the process. The newly formed viruses leave the host cells, and go on to invade other cells, continuing to multiply.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the life cycle of a virus. A virus invades a host cell, replicates itself inside the cell, and then releases new viruses to invade other cells.]()![](_page_1717_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Viruses and Bacteria > How bacteria multiply]\nBacteria are more self-sufficient than viruses. They reproduce by dividing in two. Each of the new cells then divides in two, and the process continues. Bacterial reproduction is so efficient that 1 million bacteria can develop from a single bacterium within 10 hours.\n\n![Diagram illustrating bacterial reproduction. A single Bacterium divides into two Bacterium, which then divide further, showing exponential growth.]()![](_page_1717_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\nSome infectious organisms are spread when they are coughed or sneezed into the air and breathed in; others are spread through physical contact such as a handshake. Still other organisms are spread in contaminated food or water. Some microbes are transmitted to humans from animals or animal products (such as meat or eggs). If the spread of an organism that causes an infection can be stopped, the incidence of the disease may be reduced.\n\nThe parasites that cause infestations—such as worms, ticks, and lice—are larger than bacteria and viruses, and can be seen without a microscope. Infestations usually cause symptoms only at the site of infestation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Generalized Infections]\nThe infections in this section cannot be categorized easily, but one thing they have in common is that they produce symptoms throughout the body. Infectious mononucleosis and shingles are caused by viruses, while tetanus and toxic shock syndrome are caused by bacteria.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Generalized Infections > Infectious Mononucleosis]\nInfectious mononucleosis, often called mono for short, can be caused by either the Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus (see page 508). The infection can be transmitted from one person to another through oral contact such as kissing, and can spread to almost any organ. Mononucleosis is more common in teenagers and young adults (especially those who live in dormitories) and often occurs during stressful periods, such as during final examinations.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Generalized Infections > *Symptoms*]\nThe early symptoms of infectious mononucleosis appear 4 to 6 weeks after exposure to the virus and resemble those of the flu (see page 649), including fever, headache, sore throat, swollen tonsils, and fatigue. Later symptoms may include painful, swollen glands in the neck, armpits, or groin (a condition called lymphadenopathy). Some people may also develop a rash over their entire body.

It is especially important to clean cuts that occur outdoors (where contamination with clostridium bacteria is more common) or puncture wounds (because they are hard to clean and provide an environment favorable to the growth of bacteria).\n\nInfants are immunized against tetanus during their first year of life. Booster shots are recommended at 10-year intervals throughout life (see page 145). Make sure that each family member is immunized against tetanus and has a booster shot every 10 years; keep a record of the dates when family members received their shots. Because immunization against tetanus is routine, tetanus is rare in the United States, with fewer than 100 cases each year.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Shingles]\nShingles is a condition caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (the virus that causes chickenpox; see page 439) and occurs mostly in older adults. During a chickenpox infection, the virus can invade the nerve cells in the brain stem or spinal cord and be inactive for years. If the virus is later reactivated, it can multiply, causing a rash of blisters and intense pain on the skin over the affected nerve. You cannot acquire shingles from contact with an infected person. However, if you have never had chickenpox, you can get chickenpox from a person who has shingles, because both conditions are caused by the same virus.\n\nShingles can affect almost any part of the body, but often affects one side of the trunk. The disorder can be serious if it affects the face or eyes, because it can cause temporary facial paralysis and impaired vision. It can also spread to the auditory nerves, resulting in hearing problems. In some cases, the pain from shingles persists after the blisters heal. This condition, called postherpetic neuralgia, can last weeks, months, or years.\n\nA weakened immune system seems to play a part in reactivation of the virus. For this reason, people who have an impaired immune system, such as those who have an HIV infection or AIDS or who are being treated for cancer, are at increased risk of developing shingles. These people are also at increased risk of having recurring episodes of shingles.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Q & A > Shingles]\n**Q.** *Can I get shingles from someone who has it?*\n\n**A.** You cannot get shingles from being around someone who has it. You can, however, get chickenpox, if you have never had it, from someone who has shingles because both are caused by the same virus.\n\n**Q.** *Both of my parents had shingles when they were in their 50s. Does this make me susceptible to getting shingles too?*\n\n**A.** No. Shingles does not have a genetic component. Anyone who has had chickenpox can develop shingles at any time, but the risk increases with age.\n\n**Q.** *Does stress cause shingles?*\n\n**A.** It's possible. Any condition or illness that weakens the immune system, even temporarily, can increase a person's risk of developing shingles. Stress can also weaken the immune system, making the dormant varicella zoster\n\nvirus left in the body after a chickenpox infection more likely to be reactivated, causing shingles.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of shingles include an itchy, tingling feeling or severe, burning pain in the affected area several days before a rash develops. A person may also have a headache, fever, or chills. The rash, which usually appears in a band or patch, can be itchy or painful and is contagious to people who have never had chickenpox. After a few days, the rash turns into small, fluid-filled blisters, which gradually become encrusted and less contagious. The blisters usually disappear after about 7 days and, in most cases, do not leave scars.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nYour doctor can diagnose shingles from your symptoms. Laboratory tests can confirm the diagnosis.\n\nTo treat shingles and reduce your risk of developing postherpetic neuralgia, your doctor will prescribe an antiviral medication, such as acyclovir, within 72 hours of the appearance of the rash. If your face is affected, your doctor will recommend steps you can take to protect your eyes. To relieve pain caused by postherpetic neuralgia, the doctor may prescribe an antidepressant (see page 712) or a topical medication such as lidocaine. Some doctors may prescribe corticosteroids to help reduce the risk of postherpetic neuralgia.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Toxic Shock Syndrome**]\nToxic shock syndrome is a rare condition that can develop when staphylococcal or streptococcal bacteria release toxins into the bloodstream. Toxic shock syndrome caused by staphylococcal bacteria was linked in the early 1980s to the use of superabsorbent tampons, which were then taken off the market. In rare cases, toxic shock syndrome can result when streptococcal bacteria (which are ordinarily found on the skin) infect a s", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "tetanus", "relation": "treats", "tail": "immunization"}, {"head": "booster shots", "relation": "prevents", "tail": "tetanus"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "infants", "relation": "are immunized against", "tail": "[Event: tetanus during their first year of life]"}, {"head": "family members", "relation": "should have a booster shot every 10 years", "tail": "[Event: keep a record of the dates when family members received their shots]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: contamination with clostridium bacteria]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: tetanus]"}, {"head": "[Event: puncture wounds]", "relation": "increases the risk of", "tail": "[Event: tetanus]"}]}, "status": "success"}

In the stool, the worm segments look like short pieces of narrow white ribbon. If the worm remains in the intestines, it often causes symptoms such as weight loss, occasional abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and irritation around the anus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nIf your doctor thinks you may have a tapeworm, he or she will examine a stool sample and prescribe medication to kill the parasite. The treatment can take several days. You may need to have samples of your stool examined during this time until you pass the tapeworm's head (which indicates an end to the infestation) and follow-up stool tests after 1 month and again 3 months later to make sure the worm has been eliminated.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Scabies**]\nScabies (see page 126) is an infestation with tiny arachnids called mites that burrow under the skin and lay eggs. The mites can be spread through close physical contact such as sexual intercourse or from contact with infested clothes or bedding. Scabies most often affects the hands, wrists, armpits, buttocks, or genital area, rarely the head or face. The mites that cause scabies do not live long once they are removed from the skin.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of a scabies infestation are caused by an allergic reaction to the insect's excrement and usually develop within 2 to 6 weeks in people who have never been exposed to scabies before, and within 1 to 4 days in people who have previously been exposed. Symptoms include intense itching (usually at night) and red, raised bumps on the skin. Constant scratching can cause sores and scabs to form.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose scabies, a doctor may apply a blue or black felt-tipped pen to an affected area of the body (usually the area between the fingers). If you have scabies, the ink will seep into the burrows in the skin caused by the mites. The doctor will wash the ink off the surface of the skin to expose the burrows, apply a drop of mineral oil, and scrape the area to get a sample. The sample will be examined under a microscope to check for eggs, mites, and mite feces.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTo treat a scabies infestation, your doctor will prescribe a cream or lotion containing the insecticide permethrin or lindane for you to apply to your entire body below the neck. Follow the directions on the label or your doctor's instructions for application. Wash all infested areas of your body thoroughly before applying the cream or lotion. Do not apply lindane after a hot bath, which can increase the risk that it will be absorbed into the bloodstream, where it can be toxic. Immediately after beginning treatment, wash all contaminated clothing, bedding, and towels in very hot water and dry them in a hot dryer. Ironing everything can also help kill the mites. Spraying your furniture with gamma benzene hexachloride spray can help destroy mites, but be sure to follow the directions on the label carefully and avoid getting the spray in your eyes or on your skin, especially in open wounds or sores. Everyone you've had close contact with should also be treated for scabies.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Lice]\nLice are tiny, wingless insects that can live on any part of the body and suck blood from the skin. The eggs of lice, known as nits, look like tiny white grains that cling to the hair. Infestations of body lice are rare and can be transmitted through close physical contact and by sharing infested cloth-ing, towels, or bedding. Crab lice, or pubic lice (see page\n\n485), live in pubic hair and are usually spread through sexual contact. Head lice infestations most often occur among schoolchildren. If your child has lice, report it to his or her school. Lice infestations are considered a public health problem, and it is necessary to trace them to their source to prevent them from spreading more.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Lice > **Louse (magnified)**]\n![Magnified drawing of a louse, showing its segmented body and six legs.]()![](_page_1727_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Lice > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of a lice infestation include intense itching at the site of infestation, a feeling of something moving through the hair, and slight redness to severe inflammation of the skin caused by an allergic reaction to the bites. Lice bites pose a slight risk of infection.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Lice > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nIf you have lice on your scalp or another part of your body, your doctor will recommend treating the affected area with a shampoo or lotion that contains permethrin. Carefully follow the instructions on the package. Then, using a fine-toothed comb or tweezers, remove as many nits as possible. Spray surfaces with a furniture spray that contains permethrin. Wash clothing, bedding, and towels in hot water, and dry them in a hot dryer. If possible, iron them.

Others experience swollen glands, muscle aches, and flu-like symptoms that last for a few days to several weeks. Once you have been exposed to toxoplasmosis, you cannot get it again.\n\nWomen who develop toxoplasmosis more than 6 months before becoming pregnant are immune to the infection and cannot pass it on to their fetus. Women who contract toxoplasmosis during pregnancy have a higher-than-normal risk of having a miscarriage or stillbirth and can transmit the infection to the fetus. Infants born with congenital toxoplasmosis often appear normal at birth but develop symptoms such as blindness, deafness, seizures, and mental retardation months or even years later.\n\nPeople who have a weakened immune system (such as those who are infected with HIV) cannot fight the infection and will experience headaches, confusion, fever, seizures, poor coordination, and nausea. Dormant toxoplasmosis infections can reactivate in people who have a weakened immune system, causing the same symptoms as those of a new infection.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA blood test can detect the antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) that the body produces after infection by the toxoplasma parasite. If you plan to become pregnant, consider being tested for toxoplasmosis. If the test result is positive (meaning that you have been infected), there is no need to worry about passing the infection to a fetus during pregnancy. If the test result is negative, take precautions to avoid infection (see below). To find out whether a fetus is infected, doctors perform prenatal tests, including amniocentesis (see page 510) and an ultrasound scan (see page 509).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nMost people who are infected with toxoplasmosis need no treatment. Doctors treat infected people who have weakened immune systems with two antiparasitic drugs, pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine; pregnant women who have toxoplasmosis are treated with spiramycin. These drugs also lessen the severity of an infected infant's symptoms both at birth and later in life.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prevention*]\nIf you are pregnant or have a weakened immune system because of a chronic illness such as AIDS, take the following precautions to avoid infection with the parasite that causes toxoplasmosis:\n\n- If you have a cat, don't clean the litter box yourself. Have someone clean it for you every day to reduce the chances of being exposed to infectious toxoplasma oocysts (which take up to 2 days to become infectious). If you have to clean a litter box, put on rubber gloves before you do it and avoid inhaling the dust from the litter box. Dispose of the litter in a tightly wrapped and tied plastic bag. Wash the dust off the gloves with soap and water and rinse them before taking them off. Then wash and rinse your hands thoroughly.\n- Don't eat raw or undercooked meat—especially lamb, pork, or venison—and don't feed it to your cat. Cook meat to an internal temperature of 160°F. Microwaving does not kill the toxoplasma parasite.\n- Wash your hands thoroughly after handling raw meat.\n- Don't taste meat while it is cooking.\n- Keep your cat indoors so it doesn't come into contact with infected birds or rodents.\n- Wear gardening gloves when working in the garden because outdoor cats defecate in soil. Avoid touching your mouth while gardening and always wash your hands after gardening.\n- Stay away from children's sandboxes, or keep them tightly covered. Cats sometimes use them as litter boxes.\n- Wash all fruits and vegetables well before eating them, even if they were grown in your own garden.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Rabies]\nRabies is a life-threatening disease caused by a virus that is spread to humans through a bite or scratch from an infected animal. Once the rabies virus enters a human, it travels to the nerve nearest the bite and follows the nerve pathway to the brain. In the United States, rabies rarely occurs in dogs or outdoor cats because most are vaccinated annually. The wild animals that most often carry rabies are raccoons, skunks, bats, foxes, and coyotes.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe incubation period for rabies (the time it takes from being exposed to the virus until the appearance of symptoms) varies from 10 days to 2 years but is usually about 1 to 3 months. The earliest symptoms of rabies can resemble those of other viral infections and include fever and a general feeling of illness. After 2 or 3 days of feeling ill, a person becomes confused and agitated and has mouth and throat spasms; these symptoms usually last from 2 to 10 days. Trying to drink will worsen the spasms (this is why rabies is also called hydrophobia, which means fear of water). Death usually occurs within 3 weeks after the appearance of symptoms.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nIf you have been bitten or scratched by an animal that could have rabies, call your ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "toxoplasmosis", "relation": "cause", "tail": "miscarriage"}, {"head": "toxoplasmosis", "relation": "cause", "tail": "stillbirth"}, {"head": "toxoplasmosis", "relation": "cause", "tail": "blindness"}, {"head": "toxoplasmosis", "relation": "cause", "tail": "deafness"}, {"head": "toxoplasmosis", "relation": "cause", "tail": "seizures"}, {"head": "toxoplasmosis", "relation": "cause", "tail": "mental retardation"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "women", "relation": "contract", "tail": "[Event: toxoplasmosis during pregnancy]"}, {"head": "infants", "relation": "develop", "tail": "[Event: congenital toxoplasmosis symptoms]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "lead to", "tail": "[Event: miscarriage or stillbirth]"}, {"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "lead to", "tail": "[Event: congenital toxoplasmosis symptoms]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Symptoms include severe headache, fever (up to 105°F), and severe muscle aches and weakness. Other symptoms can include chills, abdominal pain, nausea, spasms in the back, and mental confusion. Most people develop a characteristic rash (2 to 5 days after a bite) that usually begins as flat red spots on the palms of the hands and on the soles of the feet. The rash spreads to the wrists, ankles, legs, arms, and finally the trunk. Later stages of the disease include damage to the kidneys, liver, and lungs. Eventually, the person loses consciousness.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nDoctors diagnose Rocky Mountain spotted fever by taking two consecutive blood tests to check for antibodies (specific proteins the body produces to fight the bacteria). The second test is done 10 to 14 days after the illness begins to see if the level of antibodies has increased, which indicates an active infection.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTo treat Rocky Mountain spotted fever, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics as soon as the infection is diagnosed (because there is an increased risk of organ damage and death if treatment is delayed). If the disease is not treated right away, you may have to be hospitalized to treat any organ damage.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **West Nile Virus Infection**]\nWest Nile virus is spread by the bites of infected mosquitoes and can infect people, birds, horses, and some other animals. The virus does not appear to spread from person\n\nto person or from animal to person but it may be transmitted through infected donor organs or in blood transfusions. In northern climates, most cases develop in late summer or early fall. In southern climates, the virus can be transmitted throughout the year. Most people who are infected have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. However, in rare cases, the infection can cause severe symptoms and can be fatal. People over age 50 are more likely to have a severe infection. An estimated 1 in 150 people infected with the virus develops a severe form of the disease.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nSymptoms of a West Nile virus infection usually develop from 3 to 14 days after the infecting mosquito bite. A mild case, called West Nile fever, is characterized by flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache, body aches, and, sometimes, a rash on the trunk and swollen lymph nodes. The symptoms in mild cases usually last only a few days and don't cause any long-term health effects. Infection with West Nile virus may provide lifelong immunity to the virus.\n\nThe symptoms of more severe infections—West Nile encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), meningitis (inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord), and meningoencephalitis (inflammation of the brain and the membrane surrounding it)—include headache, a high fever, a stiff neck, disorientation, muscle weakness, tremors, seizures, coma, and paralysis. These symptoms can last several weeks and their effects on the brain can be permanent or fatal.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose a West Nile virus infection, a doctor will take a detailed health history to evaluate a person's risk of infection, such as being in an area where the virus has been detected. If your doctor thinks you may be infected or if you have symptoms, he or she will take a sample of blood and send it to a laboratory for microscopic examination to detect the virus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThere is no specific treatment for a West Nile virus infection. Mild cases generally clear up on their own. For severe infections, people are usually hospitalized and given intravenous fluids and antibiotics (to prevent or treat secondary bacterial infections\n\nsuch as pneumonia). If breathing is affected, a person may need to use a ventilator to temporarily assist breathing.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Babesiosis**]\nBabesiosis is a rare, potentially life-threatening disease caused by the *Babesia microti* parasite, which is spread to people through the bites of infected ticks that live on animals such as deer and mice. Babesiosis also can be transmitted through blood transfusions. The parasite that causes babesiosis attacks red blood cells.\n\nBabesiosis can be mild or severe. Most people who are infected do not become sick. However, older people and people who have an impaired immune system or who have had their spleen removed (splenectomy) are at increased risk of developing a severe infection. If not treated, babesiosis can cause extremely low blood pressure, hemolytic anemia (see page 616), liver problems, and kidney failure in high-risk people.\n\nAlthough babesiosis usually occurs in the coastal areas of the northeastern United States, cases have been reported on the West Coast and in the Midwest.

The bacteria are transmitted through polluted water, shellfish, or raw fruits and vegetables in places where sanitation is poor. Cholera seldom occurs in developed nations. When it does, it usually can be traced to visits to (or residence in) developing countries. However, every year the US Public Health Service reports a few cases of illness caused by contamination of American shellfish with bacteria related to the cholera bacillus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Cholera > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of cholera are abdominal pain and severe diarrhea. Cholera can cause such severe diarrhea that up to 4 gallons of fluid are lost in a day. A person who has cholera may have bowel movements resembling murky water that may be passed almost continuously. He or she may have muscle cramps, extreme thirst, and sudden vomiting, sometimes without the usual initial feeling of nausea. If dehydration is not treated immediately, cholera can be fatal quickly. If you are abroad or have just returned home and have extremely watery, continuous diarrhea that does not improve within a couple of hours, get medical help immediately.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Cholera > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nIf you have symptoms of cholera, see your doctor immediately. He or she will ask for stool samples to look for the bacteria in the stool. He or she may also order a blood test to look for antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) produced by the immune system to fight the cholera-causing bacteria.\n\nThe main treatment for cholera is to prevent or treat dehydration by replacing fluids. If the diarrhea is severe, you may need to be hospitalized. You will be given a rehydration fluid either orally or intravenously (through a vein) until your body chemistry is restored to normal. Your doctor also may prescribe an antibiotic.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Malaria]\nMalaria is a disease caused by any of four species of parasites called plasmodia that are transmitted from one person to another through the bite of an Anopheles mosquito (the only carrier). Plasmodia enter the bloodstream only if the Anopheles mosquito that bites you has previously bitten a person who has malaria.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Malaria > Mosquito (magnified)]\n![Illustration of a magnified mosquito.]()![](_page_1743_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\nOnce in the bloodstream, the plasmodia travel to the liver, where they multiply rapidly. After 9 to 16 days, thousands of plasmodia flow back into the bloodstream, where they destroy oxygen-carrying red blood cells, which can result in anemia (see page 610) and a high fever. Many plasmodia remain in the liver cells and continue the cycle of multiplying, entering the bloodstream, and destroying red blood cells. When the parasites inside the red blood cells mature, they rupture the cells and reenter the bloodstream. The destroyed red blood cells can form small clumps, which can block blood vessels, potentially leading to brain or kidney damage. One species of the plasmodia causes an especially dangerous infection called falciparum malaria, which can cause massive, potentially fatal blood vessel blockages.\n\nIn most forms of malaria, a person usually has repeated attacks unless the disease is treated. Each attack signals the release of plasmodia into the bloodstream. If malaria is not treated, attacks can occur for years. However, as the immune system slowly builds up a defense against the disease, the attacks occur less and less frequently.\n\nThe Anopheles mosquito is found in the southeastern and western United States and in tropical and semitropical countries. Mosquito abatement programs have virtually eradicated malaria in the United States. With the exception of a few cases each year, nearly all cases of malaria in the United States are brought back by people who have traveled to other countries.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Malaria > Symptoms]\nThe symptoms of malaria depend on the type of plasmodium carried by the mosquito and usually appear about 8 to 30 days after a mosquito bite. A full day of headache, fatigue, and nausea is followed by 12 to 24 hours of chills alternating with fever. A sudden chill is followed by a stage of fever with no sweating, and rapid breathing. A\n\ndrop in temperature accompanies a final sweating stage. Similar bouts occur whenever more plasmodia are released into the bloodstream, generally every 2 or 3 days.\n\nChildren with malaria are likely to have prolonged high fever without chills. The fever sometimes affects the brain, causing unconsciousness or seizures (see page 686).\n\nIn falciparum malaria, the most severe form, all the plasmodia are released from the liver into the bloodstream at the same time, resulting in a single extremely severe attack. The alternating chills and fever can last 2 or 3 days. If the person recovers, however, the attacks do not recur.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nIf you develop symptoms of malar", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Cholera", "relation": "caused by", "tail": "bacteria"}, {"head": "cholera bacillus", "relation": "related to", "tail": "contamination"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

If you develop a bacterial infection, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment* > Dengue]\nDengue is an infection caused by a virus that is transmitted through the bites of Aedes mosquitoes. Dengue infections occur in Central and South America, the Caribbean, the South and Central Pacific islands, Southeast Asia, China, India, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment* > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of dengue, which develop 8 to 10 days after the infecting mosquito bite, occur suddenly and resemble those of other viral infections, such as high fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, and joint and muscle pain. The joint and muscle pain is so severe that dengue is often called breakbone fever. A rash may appear 3 to 4 days after a fever develops. Dengue can last up to 10 days, but complete recovery can take 2 weeks to a month. In severe cases, dengue progresses to a life-threatening complication called dengue hemorrhage, which is characterized by severe bleeding that can be fatal.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nTo diagnose dengue, a doctor takes a detailed health history and orders blood tests to check for antibodies (infection-fighting proteins the body produces to fight the virus) or for the virus itself. If you have recently traveled to any area where dengue is prevalent and have symptoms, tell your doctor.\n\nTo treat dengue, doctors usually recommend bed rest, plenty of fluids, and a pain reliever such as acetaminophen. People with dengue should not take aspirin because aspirin interferes with blood clotting and can increase the risk of bleeding.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Leishmaniasis]\nLeishmaniasis is a potentially life-threatening disease caused by a parasite that is transmitted through the bites of infected sand flies. In very rare cases, leishmaniasis can be transmitted through blood transfusions, and from a pregnant woman to the fetus. The most common types of leishmaniasis are cutaneous leishmaniasis, mucosal leishmaniasis, and visceral leishmaniasis. The majority of cases occur in countries in South America, South Asia, and Africa. Leishmaniasis is also found in some parts of Central America, Mexico, and the Middle East. Although very rare in the United States, cutaneous leishmaniasis infections have occurred in rural areas of southern Texas.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Leishmaniasis > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of cutaneous leishmaniasis—skin sores that begin as small red or purple bumps—can appear weeks or months after a person has been bitten by an infected sand fly. The sores increase in size and develop a raised edge and central crater. The sores can cause scabs that may leave disfiguring scars. In some cases, untreated cutaneous leishmaniasis can spread, causing sores in the nose or mouth (mucosal leishmaniasis).\n\nSymptoms of visceral leishmaniasis can include fever, swollen glands, weight loss, darkening of the skin, and an enlarged spleen or liver. Visceral leishmaniasis can destroy red blood cells (which deliver oxygen to tissues) and white blood cells (which fight infection) in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow, potentially causing anemia (see page 610).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Leishmaniasis > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose cutaneous leishmaniasis, a doctor takes a detailed health history and examines the skin for the characteristic sores. If you have sores that have not healed, the doctor will take samples from the sores for examination in the laboratory. For all forms of leishmaniasis, blood tests are used to evaluate the levels of red cells, white cells, and platelets (cell fragments that enable blood to clot). You may have a blood test to look for antibodies (specific infection-fighting proteins the body produces to fight the parasite) or a test to detect the parasite itself in a tissue sample from a sore or from the bone marrow or lymph nodes.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Leishmaniasis > *Treatment*]\nThe skin sores of cutaneous leishmaniasis usually heal without treatment. However, a doctor may prescribe an antiparasitic or antifungal medication to treat cutaneous leishmaniasis or to prevent it from spreading to the nose and mouth. These drugs also are used to treat visceral leishmaniasis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Genetic Disorders]\nLike eye color and hair color, some disorders can be transmitted from one or both parents to a child. Sometimes, normal genes change (mutate) as cells divide, or genes in a parent's egg or sperm are altered by environmental factors such as radiation to produce a genetic disorder in a child whose parents are both healthy.

This information is also helping people evaluate their risk of inheriting a genetic disorder or of transmitting a disease-causing gene to a child. Of every 100 children born, two or three have a serious mental or physical disability that is genetic in origin or results from damage to, or faulty development of, the fetus during pregnancy.\n\nA child may be born with a genetically influenced disorder from a number of different causes. For example, he or she may have inherited a copy of a defective gene from each parent and have a recessive genetic disorder such as cystic fibrosis (see page 958) or sickle cell disease (see page 613). A\n\nchild may have an abnormal gene produced by a mutation in the egg or sperm of one of the parents. The occurrence of these spontaneous genetic mutations explains how parents who are completely healthy and don't carry a disease gene can have children with a genetic disorder such as muscular dystrophy (see page 972), hemophilia (see page 618), or neurofibromatosis (see page 968). A mistake during cell division before or just after fertilization can result in a chromosome abnormality such as Down syndrome (see page 955) or Turner syndrome (see page 957).\n\nIt is now possible, with many genetic disorders, to have a test to determine whether you are a carrier of a defective disease gene. Most people who suspect they may carry a defective gene wait until they are planning to have children before they are tested for the gene. However, if one child in a family has, for example, a recessive disorder such as cystic fibrosis, his or her relatives can be tested to see if they carry the cystic fibrosis gene in their cells.\n\nIf one or both parents are found to be carriers of a disease gene, genetic counselors can calculate the risk for each of their children of inheriting it and having the disease, depending on whether the abnormal disease gene is dominant or recessive. For some genetic disorders, an accurate risk calculation can be made.\n\nEven for some congenital (present at birth) disorders of unknown origin, such as heart defects, genetic counselors are often able to estimate the risk that a subsequent child will be born with the condition. As with genetic disorders, tests may be performed during pregnancy to determine whether the fetus has a developmental defect. Many of these defects, including most congenital heart defects, can be corrected early in life. For other genetic disorders, however, it is more difficult to calculate the inheritance risk precisely.\n\nIf you suspect that you may carry a gene for an inherited disorder, perhaps because a particular illness appears to run in your family, talk to a genetic counselor, who can help you evaluate your risk of passing the disorder on to a child. Also, if you have a stillborn child, ask your doctor if your child might have had a genetic disorder. If a genetic disorder is a possibility, your doctor will refer you to a genetic counselor, who can help you understand your risks of having another affected child.\n\nA genetic counselor will ask you for detailed information about the health of your and your partner's parents, brothers, sisters, cousins, and other close\n\nrelatives. It will help if you gather this information beforehand and bring it with you in writing when you see the counselor. You will be asked to give the exact cause of death of relatives, and the age at which they died, especially those who died during infancy. The counselor will also consider your ethnic and racial background and your age, which can be risk factors for some disorders.\n\nMany genetic disorders, including cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease, can be diagnosed during pregnancy. Chorionic villus sampling, or CVS (see page 511), is a prenatal diagnostic test that can be performed early in pregnancy\b\b\b\bbetween the 10th and 12th weeks. In this procedure, a sample of tissue is removed from the placenta and examined under a microscope. Another test, called amniocentesis (see page 510), may be performed later in pregnancy, at 14 to 18 weeks, to diagnose genetic disorders using cells suspended in the fluid in the amniotic sac.\n\nThese prenatal diagnostic tests pose a slight risk to the developing fetus, including infection of the uterus and miscarriage. A genetic counselor will help you evaluate the risks and benefits of having these tests and weigh them against your risk of transmitting a genetic disorder to a child. This information will enable you to make decisions about whether you are willing to undergo the possible risk to your fetus that the test might confer and whether you would choose to terminate the pregnancy if you learn that the fetus has a serious disorder.\n\nA genetic counselor will d", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "gene", "relation": "cause", "tail": "disease"}, {"head": "parent", "relation": "inherit", "tail": "child"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

One of the tests being offered is for women who are at risk of developing breast cancer or ovarian cancer because they have a family history of either disease. This test looks for two genes for breast cancer and ovarian cancer, called BRCA1 and BRCA2. Another test detects the susceptibility genes for hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer, the most common form of colon cancer (see page 775), and for familial adenomatous polyposis (see page 774), which can lead to colon cancer.

These abnormalities can occur when an extra chromosome is present, if chromosomes unite in an abnormal way, or if a chromosome is missing or broken. The majority of chromosome abnormalities arise during the formation of the mother's egg or the father's sperm, during fertilization, or during cell division after fertilization; they are usually not inherited and, for this reason, they seldom occur twice in a family.\n\nChromosome abnormalities are some of the most common and severe types of genetic disorders. An irregularity in the number or structure of chromosomes can interfere in various ways with the development and functioning of a fetus. Only those fetuses with less serious chromosome abnormalities survive until birth; severely defective embryos result in miscarriage. Babies with chromosome abnormalities who do survive can have varying degrees of mental and physical impairment or may not have any noticeable effects.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Down Syndrome]\nDown syndrome is a common genetic disorder caused by a chromosome abnormality (see above) that usually originates during cell division when an egg or sperm is formed. Eggs and sperm normally have one chromosome from every pair. However, if a pair of chromosomes does not separate during cell division, an egg or sperm will have an extra chromosome. At fertilization, this extra chromosome is transferred to the fertilized egg, and the fetus will have the extra chromosome in every cell. Down syndrome results from an extra copy of chromosome 21.\n\nA person with Down syndrome has mental impairment and characteristic physical traits. The average life expectancy of people with Down syndrome is 15 to 20 years less than that of unaffected people; most do not live beyond age 55, although some people with Down syndrome live into their 70s and 80s. People with Down syndrome are at increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (see page 688) later in life.\n\nWomen who have children after age 35 are at higher risk of having a baby with Down syndrome than are younger women. If you are planning to become pregnant and think you may be at risk of having a child with Down syndrome, genetic counseling (see page 952) can help you understand these risks.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Down Syndrome > An extra chromosome]\nNormally, we all have 23 pairs of chromosomes—22 pairs of autosomes (which are the same in both males and females) and one pair of sex chromosomes (XX for females and XY for males). A child with Down syndrome is born with an extra copy of chromosome 21.\n\n![Karyotype showing 22 pairs of chromosomes plus an extra copy of chromosome 21, indicating Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome).]()![](_page_1759_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of Down syndrome can vary from mild to severe. Infants with Down syndrome have poor muscle tone, and their movements appear floppy. Their eyes slope upward at the outer corners, their ears and facial features tend to be small, and they have short necks, small hands, and short fingers. The back of their head and the bridge of their nose are flat. At birth, these physical features are often very subtle and can be recognized only by health professionals.\n\nMany children with Down syndrome are small for their age and have delays in physical and mental development. They have some degree of mental retardation, with below-normal IQs ranging from 30 to 80. They tend to be friendly, good-natured, and affectionate, and get along well with others. Up to half of people with Down syndrome are born with congenital heart defects (see page 389). They may also have hearing loss and vision problems. Intestinal obstruction can occur shortly after birth. Children with Down syndrome are more susceptible to developing leukemia (see page 621), pneumonia (see page 660), and ear infections (see page 417) than are other children.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nThe physical characteristics of children with Down syndrome are usually recognized by health professionals at birth, although they are often not noticeable to parents. A doctor can confirm the diagnosis with a blood test to detect the extra copy of chromosome 21. Down syndrome can also be diagnosed in a fetus during pregnancy. If a blood test called AFP triple screen (see page 510), which is offered to all pregnant women, shows\n\nan increased risk of Down syndrome in the fetus, the doctor will recommend amniocentesis (see page 510) to confirm the diagnosis. Prenatal testing by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, or CVS (see page 511), is generally also offered to pregnant women 35 and older, whose age puts them at increased risk of having a child with Down syndrome. Doctors may also recommend amniocentesis or CVS to women who have a family history of Down syndrome.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Tre", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "chromosomes", "relation": "contain", "tail": "genes"}, {"head": "chromosome abnormalities", "relation": "result from", "tail": "defects in the number or structure of chromosomes"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

At puberty he may develop breast tissue that may continue to grow throughout adolescence.\n\nAdolescents with Klinefelter syndrome have normal erections and ejaculate normally, but their semen does not contain sperm. They usually have little facial hair. Some boys may have learning problems and a degree of mental retardation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nKlinefelter syndrome can be diagnosed in a fetus using chromosome analysis. If the disorder has not been detected prenatally or during childhood, a doctor who recognizes the characteristic physical features in a child at puberty will recommend genetic testing. The diagnosis may be made in a younger child if a chromosome analysis is performed to find the cause of learning problems.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTreatment for Klinefelter syndrome consists primarily of monitoring the boy's testosterone level each year, starting at age 12 or 13. If his testosterone level is low, he is given monthly injections of a synthetic form of testosterone to help promote normal physical and sexual development. (The testosterone supplements do not, however, give him the ability to make sperm.) As he gets older, he may need to have more frequent injections. If his breasts become enlarged enough to cause embarrassment, they can be reduced surgically.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Autosomal Recessive Disorders]\nMany genetic disorders are inherited as recessive disorders. A person with one copy of a recessive disease gene is called a carrier, and is usually unaffected by the gene because he or she has a healthy copy of the gene that overrides the effects of the defective gene. If two carriers of a defective recessive disease gene have children, each of their children has a 25 percent chance of inheriting both defective copies of the gene (one from each parent) and having the disease, a 50 percent chance of inheriting one defective copy and one healthy copy of the gene and being a carrier like his or her parents, and a 25 percent chance of inheriting two healthy copies of the gene and being neither affected nor a carrier. If only one of the parents has a defective\n\ncopy of a recessive disease gene, all of their children will be healthy (although each has a 50 percent chance of inheriting a copy of the disease gene and being a carrier).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Autosomal Recessive Disorders > **Recessive inheritance**]\nIn recessive inheritance, a person needs to inherit two copies of a defective gene to have a disorder—that is, he or she needs to inherit an abnormal recessive gene from each parent. A carrier has one healthy copy of the gene and one defective copy. Carriers are usually not affected because their healthy copy of the gene overrides the effects of the defective gene. If two carriers of a particular recessive disease gene have children, each child has a 50 percent chance of receiving a healthy copy of the gene from one parent and a defective copy from the other parent, and of being a carrier like his or her parents. Carriers can pass on a defective copy of a recessive gene through several generations without any of the children having the disorder. Each child of two carriers has a 25 percent chance of receiving two defective copies of the gene and having the disorder, and a 25 percent chance of receiving two healthy copies of the gene and being unaffected.\n\nDiagram illustrating the inheritance of a recessive disease gene from two carriers (Parents) to their four children.\n\n**Parents:** Both parents are shown as carriers (heterozygous). The male parent is a carrier (one healthy allele, one defective allele). The female parent is a carrier (one healthy allele, one defective allele).\n\n**Children:** The four children are shown below the parents.

The genetic defect causes the lining of the airways leading to the lungs to produce excess mucus that clogs the lungs and makes the person vulnerable to chronic lung infections.

In a child who has not been tested, a doctor can diagnose the disorder from the symptoms and the results of blood, urine, and hormone tests. He or she may also do an ultrasound scan of the child's adrenal glands.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nChildren who have congenital adrenal hyperplasia are given drugs to replace the deficient hormones, returning their hormone levels to normal and decreasing their body's production of androgens. They continue taking the hormones for life. Baby girls with ambiguous genitalia need to have surgery to correct the appearance of their external reproductive organs. This reconstructive surgery is usually done between ages 1 and 3. With early treatment, a child will have normal sexual development and function, including normal fertility.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Tay-Sachs Disease**]\nTay-Sachs disease is a rare, devastating inborn error of metabolism caused by the lack of an enzyme called hexosaminidase A, which helps break down fats in brain and nerve cells. Without the enzyme, fats build up and destroy the central nervous system, causing paralysis and early death, usually by age 4 or 5. The disorder is most common among Ashkenazi Jews. Because the genetic defect is recessive, a child is affected only if both parents are carriers of the gene and the child inherits a copy of the gene from each parent.\n\nAll Ashkenazi Jewish couples are offered genetic testing to determine if they are carriers of the gene—nearly 1 in 29 Ashkenazi Jews is a carrier of the Tay-Sachs gene. If both parents are found to be carriers of the gene, they can have prenatal testing (see page 954) to determine if the fetus is affected. A genetic counselor can help them evaluate their risk of having a child with Tay-Sachs disease and can explain various family planning options they may want to consider.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nMost newborns with Tay-Sachs disease appear normal at birth but begin losing muscle strength at about 3 to 6 months of age. They have difficulty turning over or sitting up, they stop smiling, they lose interest in their surroundings, and they have delayed mental and physical development. They may have seizures and severe constipation, and they gradually become blind, deaf, and paralyzed.\n\nIn a rare form of the disease, the symptoms don't appear until ages 2 to 5, and the disease progresses more slowly, but usually causes death by age 15.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTay-Sachs disease can be diagnosed before birth using chorionic villus sampling, or CVS (see page 511), or amniocentesis (see page 510). After birth, the disease can be diagnosed by a blood test that measures the level of the enzyme hexosaminidase A.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTay-Sachs disease has no treatment. Parents and caregivers focus on making the child as comfortable as possible. If you care for your child at home, your doctor and other trained health care specialists will help you learn how to meet your child's needs. If you cannot care for your child at home, an extended care center that has experience caring for children with Tay-Sachs disease is an option. You and your other children may benefit from talking with a mental health professional, who can help you cope with the emotional difficulties of having a child or sibling with a fatal disease.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Canavan Disease]\nCanavan disease is a rare, inherited brain disorder resulting from an enzyme deficiency that causes a normal substance called *N*-acetylaspartic acid to build up in the brain in much higher-than-normal amounts. The excess *N*-acetylaspartic acid destroys the protective covering (myelin sheath) around brain cells. As the myelin sheath degenerates, the white matter of the brain becomes spongy and develops spaces filled with fluid. *N*-acetylaspartic acid also builds up in the urine (where it does not pose any health risks).\n\nThe gene that transmits Canavan disease is recessive, which means that a child must inherit two copies of the defective gene (one from each parent) to have the disease. The disorder affects primarily people of Eastern European, Jewish (Ashkenazi) descent. For this reason, Ashkenazi Jewish couples are offered genetic testing before they start planning a family to determine if they are carriers of the gene. If you and your partner are carriers of the gene, a genetic counselor can help you evaluate your risk of having a child with the disorder and explain various family planning options you might want to consider.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nSigns and symptoms of Canavan disease appear in early infancy and include a rapidly enlarging head circumference, loss of acquired motor skills, feeding problems, floppy or stiff muscle tone, and poor h", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "drugs", "relation": "replace", "tail": "hormones"}, {"head": "hormones", "relation": "return to normal", "tail": "body's production of androgens"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "diagnose", "tail": "[Event: from symptoms and test results]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "do an ultrasound scan", "tail": "[Event: of the child's adrenal glands]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment]"}]}, "status": "success"}

In men, symptoms of hemochromatosis tend to develop between ages 30 and 50; in women, symptoms usually appear after age 50. The disorder often goes undiagnosed because the symptoms can be vague and similar to those of many common disorders, such as osteoarthritis (see page 996). The most common initial symptoms are joint pain, fatigue, lack of energy, abdominal pain, loss of sex drive, and heart problems. Ask your doctor about being tested for hemochromatosis if you have any of these symptoms. Many people have no symptoms when the disease is diagnosed.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nDoctors diagnose hemochromatosis from a person's health history, a physical examination, and blood tests to measure the amount of iron stored in the body. If a blood test shows a higher-than-normal level of iron, the doctor will probably confirm the diagnosis with a genetic test to detect the disease-causing gene mutation. To evaluate the buildup of iron in the liver and to determine if the liver is damaged, he or she may recommend a liver function test and, if the results are abnormal, a liver biopsy (microscopic analysis of a sample of tissue taken from the liver).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nHemochromatosis is usually treated by a doctor who specializes in liver disorders (a hepatologist), digestive disorders (a gastroenterologist), or blood disorders (a hematologist). You may need to see a number of specialists, depending on the organ systems that are affected.\n\nTreatment, which is simple, safe, and inexpensive, involves removing blood to reduce the level of iron. Depending on the degree of your iron overload, you will probably have a pint of blood taken once or twice a week for several months to a year or more. After every four blood donations (called phlebotomies), you will have a blood test to measure the level of iron in your blood. Once your iron level is in the low-to-normal range, you must try to maintain the level by giving a pint of blood every 1 to 4 months throughout your life. An annual blood test can help determine how frequently you need to give blood.\n\nYour doctor will recommend that you take daily vitamin supplements that do not contain iron and limit your consumption of vitamin C to 500 milligrams daily (because vitamin C increases the body's absorption of iron). You should also limit your intake of alcohol to avoid liver damage.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Phenylketonuria**]\nPhenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism, a genetic disorder in which the body cannot process the amino acid phenylalanine. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, which the body needs to develop and function. Normally, excess amounts of the amino acids in foods we eat are broken down or excreted. However, in people with PKU, phenylalanine is not processed normally and it builds up in the blood, causing brain damage. Phenylalanine is present in protein-containing foods such as milk products, eggs, meat, and fish.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nNewborns with PKU may appear normal for the first several weeks or months of life. However, if the disease is not detected and treated, they gradually lose interest in their surroundings and eventually begin to show signs of mental impairment. By the time they are 1 year old, they may have delayed mental development. Untreated children may have jerky arm or leg movements, be restless and destructive, and may give off a musty odor from the accumulation of phenylalanine in their body. Some children with PKU have seizures (see page 686). Children with PKU generally have lighter hair, skin, and eye color than other members of their family.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nAll states require testing of newborns for PKU shortly after birth (see page 954). A few drops of blood are taken from a needle prick in the baby's heel, and the blood is analyzed in a laboratory for phenylalanine. If the level of phenylalanine is higher than normal, the doctor will recommend more sensitive tests to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf your child is found to have PKU, the doctor will prescribe a diet that severely restricts foods containing phenylalanine. (Some phenylalanine must be in the diet because a certain amount of the amino acid is essential.) Children with PKU can be breast-fed or given regular formula in limited amounts supplemented with a special phenylalanine-free formula. After a baby begins to eat specially selected solid foods, he or she must continue to consume the special formula as his or her major source of protein. People with PKU need to see their doctor regularly for tests to measure the level of phenylalanine in their blood and to make adjustments in their diet when necessary.

This treatment is very effective in reversing the enlargement of the liver and spleen, preventing bone disease, and improving the quality of life of people with type 1 disease. Treatment may not be as effective for people who have type 2 or type 3 Gaucher disease. For people with any form of Gaucher disease, doctors recommend regular examinations, blood tests, and imaging procedures to monitor the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of the treatment.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Galactosemia**]\nGalactosemia is an inborn error of metabolism that results from the partial or complete lack of an enzyme (called galactose 1-phosphate uridyltransferase, or GALT) that converts the sugar galactose into glucose (which the body uses for energy). Normally, when a person eats a food containing the sugar lactose (such as dairy products), the body breaks down the lactose into galactose and glucose. If galactose cannot be converted into glucose, it accumulates in the blood and can damage organs. Untreated, galactosemia can cause an enlarged liver, kidney failure (see page 816), cataracts (see page 1041), and brain damage, and is fatal.\n\nThe most severe, classic form of galactosemia is a recessive genetic disorder, which results when a child inherits two copies of the defective gene, one from each parent. A less severe form of galactosemia, called Duarte galactosemia, results when a child inherits a copy of the gene for the classic form from one parent and a copy of the Duarte gene from the other parent. In Duarte galactosemia, the enzyme is partly active and able to convert some galactose into glucose.\n\nIf you have a child with galactosemia, seek genetic counseling (see page 952) to learn your chances of having another child with the disorder.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of untreated galactosemia begin to appear shortly after birth when a newborn drinks breast milk or formula. Early symptoms include yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice; see page 785) and vomiting. The baby may be irritable, have diarrhea, fail to gain weight, and develop severe infections. Without treatment, a child with galactosemia can develop cataracts or mental retardation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nBoth forms of galactosemia can be diagnosed during newborn screening tests (see page 954). Galactosemia can also be diagnosed during pregnancy with chorionic villus sampling, or CVS (see page 511), or amniocentesis (see page 510) if both parents are carriers of the gene. If your child has not been tested and he or she has symptoms of galactosemia, your doctor will order blood and urine tests to diagnose the disorder.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe treatment of galactosemia involves excluding all foods from the diet that contain lactose or galactose—including breast milk, dairy products, and most legumes. Even when a child is started on a restrictive diet at birth, the disorder can cause long-term complications, including speech and language problems, delays in developing fine and gross motor skills, and learning disabilities. For unknown reasons, girls with galactosemia usually have premature ovarian failure that results in infertility.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Homocystinuria**]\nHomocystinuria is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, an inborn error of metabolism that usually results from a deficiency of an enzyme called cystathionine beta synthase. This enzyme enables the body to properly digest an amino acid in food called methionine. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and are essential for healthy growth and development. The inability to properly digest methionine leads to buildup of a protein called homocysteine in the blood, which can interfere with a baby's growth and development.\n\nMany states now test all newborns for homocystinuria. If not diagnosed and treated early in life, more serious symptoms, such as eye abnormalities and mental retardation, can develop by age 3. If you or your partner has a family history of homocystinuria and you are thinking about having children, talk to a genetic counselor about your risk of passing the disorder on to children. Your children are at risk of inheriting the disorder only if both of you carry a copy of the gene for homocystinuria. The disorder can be diagnosed during pregnancy with chorionic villus sampling, or CVS (see page 511), or amniocentesis (see page 510).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nNewborns with homocystinuria appear normal, but they may fail to grow or gain weight at the normal rate and they may not achieve the expected developmental milestones (see page 377). By about age 3, more noticeable symptoms develop, including partial dislocation of the lens of the eye and severe nearsightedness.

Eventually, the person develops chronic emphysema (see page 656) by the third or fourth decade of life (earlier if he or she smokes). People who develop cirrhosis of the liver may have nausea, flatulence, weight loss, weakness, and abdominal pain.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nAlpha1-antitrypsin deficiency can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms can mimic those of asthma (see page 640) or chronic bronchitis (see page 655), but a diagnosis of emphysema at an early age raises a red flag. A simple blood test can measure levels of alpha1-antitrypsin. If blood levels fall below 45 percent of normal, the doctor will order additional blood tests to identify the defective gene. The doctor will also order other tests of the lungs, including a pulmonary function test that measures how well the airways are working, a blood gas analysis that gauges the amount of oxygen in the blood, a chest X-ray, and exercise testing. An electrocardiogram (see page 559), which measures the electrical activity of the heart, may also be performed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the level of breathing incapacity.\n\nDoctors use blood and urine tests to test liver function in people suspected of having alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency. If a person has cirrhosis, the doctor may be able to feel abnormalities in the liver during a physical examination. A CT scan (see page 112), ultrasound scan (see page 111), and a radioisotope scan (see page 114) of the liver and spleen can also detect liver damage.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTreatment of alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency focuses first on protecting the lungs from damage. The single most important step to take to preserve lung function is to avoid smoking. People who have alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency should get yearly immunizations for influenza (see page 649) and pneumonia (see page 660) and see their doctor at the first sign of a cold or other respiratory problem (when white blood cells travel to the lungs to fight infection). Drinking alcohol can accelerate the liver damage.\n\nTo counteract the weight loss caused by the liver damage, affected people need to consume a sufficient amount of calories.\n\nTo reduce shortness of breath, doctors may prescribe medication such as bronchodilators (to expand the airways) and inhaled corticosteroids (to fight inflammation). Weekly intravenous infusions of alpha-1-antitrypsin (derived from pooled human blood) can be given intravenously (through a vein). Some people with the disorder may need supplemental oxygen.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Autosomal Dominant Disorders]\nA dominant gene, whether it's a gene for eye color or a disease, will determine the characteristic or disorder no matter what type of corresponding gene is on the matching chromosome. For example, the gene for brown eyes is dominant. If a child inherits a gene for brown eyes from one parent and a gene for blue eyes from the other parent, the child will have brown eyes. If both parents have brown eyes, each could also have a gene for blue eyes and, if each parent transmits the blue-eye gene to a child, the child will have blue eyes. In the same way, a person who receives a defective copy of a dominant disease gene, such as the gene for Huntington disease (see page 969), will have the disease. If one parent has a dominant gene for a disorder, each of his or her children has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the gene and also having the disease.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Autosomal Dominant Disorders > Dominant inheritance]\nIn dominant genetic traits and disorders, a person needs only one copy of the dominant gene to have the trait or disorder. A person who has a dominant trait such as brown eyes or a dominant genetic disorder such as Marfan syndrome has a one-in-two (50 percent) chance of passing the gene to each child. He or she also has a 50 percent chance of passing the healthy copy of the gene to each child, who will be unaffected. Most dominant traits and disorders affect males and females with equal frequency. A child can be born with a dominant disorder either by inheriting the gene from a parent who is also affected or as a result of a new gene change (mutation) that occurred in a parent's egg or sperm cell before conception.\n\nDiagram illustrating a pedigree chart for Marfan Syndrome.\n\nThe chart shows the relationship between Parents and their four Children.\n\nLegend:\n\n- Affected male (Dark gray circle with male symbol)\n- Affected female (Dark gray circle with female symbol)\n- Unaffected male (White circle with male symbol)\n- Unaffected female (White circle with female symbol)\n\n![](_page_1780_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Marfan Syndrome]\nMarfan syndrome is a rare inherited genetic disorder that affects connective tissue throughout the body, including in the bones, lungs, eyes, heart, and blood vessels.

The most common sign of NF1 is the appearance of flat, light-brown spots on the skin called café au lait (French for “coffee with milk”) spots, which can appear at birth or in early infancy. Children with NF1 usually have six or more of these spots on their body, each spot measuring more than 1/5 inch. By puberty, the spots begin to grow to about 1/2 inch in diameter. Tumors begin to grow around nerves throughout the body during adolescence and appear as small lumps or bumps under the skin.\n\nA person with NF1 may also have freckles in his or her armpits and groin area, abnormal tissue in the iris (the colored part of the eye), poor vision resulting from the growth of tumors on the nerves behind the eyes, and deformed bones in the spine or legs. Some people with NF1 also have learning disabilities (see page 415) or develop a seizure disorder (see page 686).\n\nNF2 causes progressive hearing loss, beginning during adolescence, as tumors grow around the nerves involved with hearing. A person with NF2 also may have ringing in the ears (tinnitus; see page 1020), problems with balance, skin growths, and vision problems caused by thickening of the lens of the eye. Tumors in the head can cause\n\nheadaches, numbness, and pain in the face. In rare, severe cases, brain tumors caused by NF2 can be fatal.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf a doctor knows that one of a child's parents or another family member has neurofibromatosis, he or she can sometimes test for the disorder in the fetus before birth (prenatal testing; see page 954). To diagnose the disorder in a child who develops the symptoms of either type of neurofibromatosis after birth, a doctor may order X-rays, an eye examination, vision and hearing tests, or a CT scan (see page 112) or MRI (see page 113) of the brain. The results of these tests and a physical examination, along with the child's family health history, can confirm or rule out a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf your child has been diagnosed with neurofibromatosis, he or she should have regular checkups and examinations to monitor the progression of the disorder and treat any new symptoms. For disfiguring or painful tumors under the skin, a doctor may recommend removing them surgically, although the tumors may grow back. Tumors that affect hearing or vision may require treatment to preserve these senses.\n\nBone deformities such as scoliosis (see page 433) can be treated with surgery, a brace, or both. In the rare cases in which the brain or spinal cord tumors become cancerous, doctors recommend surgery along with radiation therapy (see page 23) and chemotherapy (see page 23).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Huntington Disease**]\nHuntington disease is a devastating, degenerative brain disorder caused by a dominant genetic defect that destroys cells in a part of the brain called the basal ganglia, which slowly destroys a person's ability to think, walk, and talk. The onset of the degenerative process usually begins between ages 30 and 50, but it occasionally develops in young children and in the elderly.\n\nHuntington disease affects people of both sexes and all races throughout the world. Because symptoms usually do not appear until middle age, many people are not aware\n\nthey have the gene until after they have children (who have a 50 percent chance of also having the gene). A test is available that can identify people who have the Huntington gene. If the disease has occurred in a member of your family, including in cousins, aunts, or uncles, and you are considering having the test or are unsure what to do, a genetic counselor (see page 952) can help you evaluate your risk of having the gene and can explain the risks and benefits of testing.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of Huntington disease vary widely from person to person, even in the same family. Early symptoms can include emotional problems such as depression, mood swings, irritability, and anxiety. Behavioral changes can include aggressive outbursts, impulsiveness, demanding behavior, and withdrawal from friends and family. Sexual desire may be absent or exaggerated. As the disease progresses, a person becomes increasingly less able to concentrate and his or her short-term memory declines. Physical symptoms begin as nervous twitching, fidgeting, or restlessness. The person's handwriting may change, and he or she may be less able to perform skills that require coordination and concentration, such as driving. Over time, the person will develop more noticeable involuntary movements of his or her head, trunk, and limbs. The person slowly loses the ability to walk, speak, and swallow. Eventually, he or she can no longer function independently and dies from complications such as choking, infection, or heart failure.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagn", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "NF1", "relation": "has", "tail": "symptoms"}, {"head": "café au lait spots", "relation": "are", "tail": "signs of NF1"}, {"head": "tumors", "relation": "appear as", "tail": "small lumps or bumps under the skin"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "children with NF1", "relation": "have", "tail": "[Event: six or more café au lait spots appear at birth or in early infancy]"}, {"head": "people with NF1", "relation": "begin to grow", "tail": "[Event: tumors begin to grow around nerves throughout the body during adolescence]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: six or more café au lait spots appear at birth or in early infancy]", "relation": "lead to", "tail": "[Event: tumors begin to grow around nerves throughout the body during adolescence]"}, {"head": "[Event: puberty begins]", "relation": "cause", "tail": "[Event: spots begin to grow to about 1/2 inch in diameter]"}]}, "status": "success"}

If you have loose joints, your doctor may recommend avoiding activities that can make your joints lock or overextend or increase the wear and tear on them, increasing your risk of developing osteoarthritis (see page 996) at a younger age than usual. Activities you might be asked to avoid include gymnastics, ballet, figure skating, long-distance running, and competitive sports involving running. Your doctor may recommend a brace to stabilize your joints.\n\nIn some people, surgery is necessary to repair damaged joints. Your doctor may refer you to a physical or occupational therapist, who can help you strengthen your muscles and teach you how to use and protect your joints properly. To reduce bruising and improve wound healing, some doctors recommend vitamin C supplements for people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (however, don't take vitamin C without talking to your doctor first).\n\nIf your child has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, he or she needs to avoid contact sports and other physically stressful activities that could result in injuries and increase the risk of chronic pain later in life. Also, make sure your child knows not to show off the unusual positions he or she can put his or her joints into, because doing so can damage the joints. Make sure that other family members and your child's friends and teachers have knowledge about Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that will enable them to help your child if necessary.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **X-Linked Disorders**]\nX-linked disorders, also called sex-linked disorders, are genetic disorders that are transmitted by a defective gene on an X chromosome. The X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Females have two X chromosomes; males have\n\none X chromosome and one Y chromosome. All egg cells contain an X chromosome. If a sperm that fertilizes an egg carries an X chromosome, the resulting embryo will have two X chromosomes and will be female. If a sperm carries a Y chromosome, the embryo will have an X and a Y chromosome and will be male.\n\nMost X-linked traits and disorders are recessive and are passed from mothers to sons. Women are rarely affected by X-linked disorders because their other X chromosome has a healthy copy of the gene, which overrides the effects of the disease gene. However, females can be carriers of an X-linked disorder, and they have a 50 percent chance of transmitting the X chromosome with the disease gene to a son, who will have the disease. Boys who receive an X-linked gene from their mother will be affected because they have only one X chromosome (and a Y chromosome from their father).\n\nThe daughters of female carriers of X-linked disease genes also have a 50 percent chance of inheriting their mother's X-linked disease gene; they, however, will be unaffected carriers. An X-linked recessive disease gene can be transmitted through many generations of a family by healthy carrier mothers before it becomes apparent when, for the first time, a boy in the family is born with the disease.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **X-Linked Disorders** > **X-linked inheritance**]\nDisorders that are caused by defective genes on the X sex chromosome generally are transmitted from mothers to sons, who receive one X chromosome (only from their mother). A woman who has the defective gene on the X chromosome is usually unaffected. She has a 50 percent chance of passing the gene on to a son, who will be affected, and a 50 percent chance of passing the gene on to a daughter, who will be an unaffected carrier like her mother.\n\nDiagram illustrating the inheritance pattern of Fragile X Syndrome.\n\nThe diagram shows a cross between two parents (Parents) and their four children (Children).\n\nLegend:\n\n- Affected male (Dark gray circle with arrow)\n- Female carrier (Half gray, half white circle with arrow)\n- Unaffected male (White circle with arrow)\n- Unaffected female (White circle with cross)\n\n![](_page_1788_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Fragile X Syndrome]\nFragile X syndrome is caused by a defective gene on the X sex chromosome that narrows the affected part of the chromosome and makes it look fragile. Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. Males are more likely to have the disorder and to have more severe symptoms than females. Because females can have one defective X chromosome and one healthy X chromosome, they can be carriers of fragile X and either have no symptoms or have a mild form of the disease. They have a 50 percent chance of transmitting their defective X chromosome to a son, who will be affected. If you have a family history of fragile X syndrome or if you have a child with fragile X syndrome, you can benefit from talking to a genetic counselor (see page 952), who can evaluate your risk of transmitting the disorder to a future child.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nPhysical features that are characteristic of fragile X syndrome m", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "recommend", "tail": "activities"}, {"head": "brace", "relation": "stabilize", "tail": "joints"}, {"head": "surgery", "relation": "repair", "tail": "damaged joints"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "refer", "tail": "[Event: physical or occupational therapist]"}, {"head": "physical or occupational therapist", "relation": "strengthen", "tail": "[Event: muscles]"}, {"head": "physical or occupational therapist", "relation": "teach", "tail": "[Event: use and p]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "lead to", "tail": "[Event: treatment]"}]}, "status": "success"}

He or she may also order a test called electromyography, which evaluates the electrical activity in muscles. To confirm the diagnosis, the doctor may recommend a biopsy (in which a sample of the child's muscle tissue is sent to a laboratory for examination) or genetic testing of a sample of the child's blood.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nMuscular dystrophy has no specific treatment. Doctors and caregivers usually focus on relieving the symptoms, helping the child perform activities of daily living, and making his or her life as comfortable as possible. The effects of muscular dystrophy can be reduced significantly by staying active and keeping the body as flexible, upright, and mobile as possible. A physical therapist will work with the child to teach him or her to perform range-of-motion exercises to prevent the tendons (bands of tissue that support the joints) from shortening and causing the joints to stiffen. Braces on the hands and lower legs can also help keep the limbs stretched and flexible. Most children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy need a wheelchair full-time by about age 12, which helps them remain active and independent. In some cases, doctors prescribe corticosteroids, which may help slow the loss of muscle function and increase strength. Ask your doctor or the local chapter of the Muscular Dystrophy Association about support groups, summer camps, and other services that might be available in your community for people with muscular dystrophy and their families.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Bones, Muscles, and Joints]\nBones, muscles, and joints provide the body a supportive framework that allows flexibility of movement. All movement, including the movement of the organs inside the body, is carried out by muscles, which can do their job because they are composed of tissues that can contract.\n\nVoluntary muscles, such as those in the arms and legs, are under conscious control. For example, if you want to bend your elbow, your brain instructs your biceps muscle to contract; if you want to straighten your arm, your brain signals your biceps muscle to relax and instructs your triceps muscle to contract. These brain signals are sent through the nervous system. Involuntary muscles, such as those in the heart and the digestive tract, function without your conscious control or awareness.\n\nThe 206 bones of the skeleton serve mainly as a support system for the body. Some bones also cover and protect organs. For example, the skull protects the brain, and the rib cage and bones of the spine (vertebrae) shield the heart, lungs, and, to some extent, upper abdominal organs such as the stomach, liver, and kidneys.\n\nBones are composed of living cells embedded in a dense framework of collagen (the protein that provides structure and strength to tissues) and saturated with the minerals calcium and phosphorus. This framework both stores these minerals and supplies them to the rest of the body when needed. Inside some bones is a soft core of bone marrow, which manufactures blood cells. Some bones, such as those of the skull, are joined closely together in childhood by virtually immovable connective fibers called sutures.\n\nJoints are the movable connections between bones that enable the bones to move in relation to each other. There are many different types of joints in the body. The vertebrae (the bones in the spine) can move only slightly in relation to each other, but provide enough flexibility over the entire spine to allow the back to bend. Hinge joints, such as those in the fingers, permit movement primarily backward and forward. Ball-and-socket joints such as the shoulders and hips are more versatile than hinge joints and allow the limbs to bend, twist, turn, and move in almost any direction.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > How the Skeleton and Muscles Work Together]\nSkeletal muscles are attached to two or more bones. When a muscle contracts, the bones to which it is attached move. Muscles usually work in coordinated groups; contraction of one muscle causes relaxation of another. Some muscles stabilize nearby joints.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > How the Skeleton and Muscles Work Together > Abdominal muscles]\nThe large group of muscles in the abdomen assists in the regular movements of breathing, balances the muscles of the spine during lifting, and holds the abdominal organs in place.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > How the Skeleton and Muscles Work Together > Leg muscles]\nLeg muscles are among the most powerful in the body and are strongly attached to bone, especially at the hip.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > How the Skeleton and Muscles Work Together > Head and neck muscles]\nContractions of the head and neck muscles produce facial expressions and head movements and are responsible for speech and swallowing.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > How the Skeleton and", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "muscular dystrophy", "relation": "has", "tail": "blood test"}, {"head": "muscular dystrophy", "relation": "has", "tail": "electromyography"}, {"head": "muscular dystrophy", "relation": "has", "tail": "biopsy"}, {"head": "muscular dystrophy", "relation": "has", "tail": "genetic testing"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "orders", "tail": "[Event: blood test]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "orders", "tail": "[Event: electromyography]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "recommends", "tail": "[Event: biopsy]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "recommends", "tail": "[Event: genetic testing]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: diagnosis]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Anyone who exercises vigorously has an increased risk of injuring his or her muscles, ligaments (tough elastic bands of tissue that hold bones together), bones, and joints. Sports injuries frequently occur in athletes at the beginning of a sports season and in people who are new to a sport or who start an exercise or activity after a long period of inactivity. Exercising without warming up first can also contribute to injuries.\n\nTaking precautions such as stretching before exercising can help you avoid injury. If you are injured, stop the activity right away to determine the extent of the injury. If you're not sure how serious your injury is, or if you are disoriented, even for only a few seconds, stop the exercise or sport immediately and see a doctor as soon as possible. Many injuries require no treatment other than rest. You may need physical therapy to treat damaged tissues and to strengthen affected muscles. If the injury is severe, you may need surgery. If an injury recurs, you may have permanently damaged a ligament or bone and may have to give up the sport or activity or risk developing a chronic condition such as osteoarthritis (see page 996). To help prevent an injury from worsening or becoming permanent, get an accurate evaluation of the damage from a doctor. He or she will probably order X-rays, a CT scan (see page 112), MRI (see page 113), ultrasound (see page 111), or arthroscopy (see page 1001) to determine the extent of the injury.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sports Injuries > The RICE Routine]\nIf you have a minor muscle or ligament injury such as a strain or sprain, RICE—which stands for rest, ice, compression, and elevation—is usually the best way to treat it. Performing the RICE routine will help relieve any pain or swelling and enable you to recover more quickly.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sports Injuries > The RICE Routine > **Rest**]\nRest the injured area and avoid moving it or putting any unnecessary weight or pressure on it. Use a sling to rest an injured shoulder or arm, and crutches to take weight off an injured leg.\n\nRest reduces bleeding from damaged blood vessels, minimizes the risk of more damage, and enables tissues to heal.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sports Injuries > The RICE Routine > *Ice*]\nApply an ice pack to the injured area as soon as possible. Apply the ice every hour you're awake for 20 minutes for the first 24 to 48 hours after an injury. Cold helps relieve pain and minimize bruising and swelling by stopping internal bleeding and the accumulation of fluids in the injured area.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sports Injuries > The RICE Routine > *Compression*]\nWear a compression bandage around the injured muscle or joint for at least 2 days. Extend the bandage well above and below the injured area and try to apply the pressure evenly but not too tightly. The bandage is too tight if it causes numbness and tingling or increases the pain. Compressing the injured area helps reduce bleeding and swelling.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sports Injuries > The RICE Routine > *Elevation*]\nKeep an injured leg above the level of your heart as much as possible. Elevate an arm or hand with a sling. Elevating the injured area helps drain fluid from the area and reduces bleeding and swelling.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Dislocated Shoulder and Separated Shoulder]\nA dislocated shoulder occurs when the top of the humerus (the bone of the upper arm) pops out of the joint. A separated shoulder occurs when ligaments that hold the collarbone to the shoulder blade are stretched or torn. Both injuries cause sudden, severe pain, swelling, and bruising, and the shoulder has an abnormal shape and limited movement. These injuries usually result from a fall or a direct blow to the shoulder.\n\nTo prevent a dislocated or separated shoulder:\n\n- Ease into your workouts.\n- Avoid situations that could cause shoulder injury.\n- Wear layers of clothing or padding to help cushion a fall.\n\n- Work with a trainer or physical therapist to strengthen the muscles, ligaments, and tendons of your shoulder.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Swimmer's Shoulder]\nSwimmer's shoulder is a strain or minor tear in a muscle between the neck and the top of the arm that causes pain in the top, front part of the shoulder.

All of these injuries result from overuse of the leg muscles.\n\nTo prevent shin splints:\n\n- Ease into your workouts.\n- Work with a trainer or physical therapist on exercises to strengthen the muscles surrounding your ankles.\n- Wear arch supports to help relieve stress on the lower part of your leg.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Achilles Tendinitis]\nAchilles tendinitis is inflammation of the tendon that attaches the calf muscles to the heel. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to severe pain and swelling in the lower, back part of the leg, about 2 inches above the ankle. Achilles tendinitis results from constant or sudden stress to the tendon.\n\nTo prevent Achilles tendinitis:\n\n- Ease into your workouts.\n- Wear heel lifts in your athletic shoes to relieve pressure on your heels.\n- Wear shoes that fit properly (overly stiff heels can cause or worsen Achilles tendinitis) and that are appropriate for the sport or activity; replace them when they wear out.\n- Work with a trainer or physical therapist on exercises to strengthen your calf muscles and stretch your Achilles tendon.\n- Run on soft surfaces such as dirt or wood tracks—not on concrete.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sprained Ankle]\nA sprained ankle is a partial to complete tear in the ligaments on the inside or outside of the ankle that occurs when the ankle is twisted. It is the most common musculoskeletal injury. Symptoms range from mild to intense pain. You may feel a popping or tearing sensation in your ankle, and the top of the foot may swell and bruise.\n\nTo prevent sprained ankle:\n\n- Ease into your workouts.\n- Tape your ankle or put an elastic bandage on it before you exercise to make it more stable.\n\n- Wear shoes that fit properly and are appropriate for the sport or activity; replace them when they wear out. The heel counter of the shoe (the part of the shoe that wraps around the heel) should provide support for your ankle. Good shoes have a heel cup (a molded insert), which provides stability to the ankle. Shoes that lace up give the ankles more support than shoes that slip on or close with fasteners.\n- Work with a trainer or physical therapist to strengthen the muscles around your ankle and lower calf.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pain in the Front of the Foot]\nPain in the front third of the foot can be caused by Morton's neuroma, which usually results from swelling of a nerve between the third and fourth metatarsals (two of the five long bones in the middle of the foot between the tarsals at the back of the foot and the phalanges, which form the toes). The pain usually is more noticeable on the top of the foot but may also develop in the ball of the foot or on the bottom of the toes.

The strained muscle feels tender, may become swollen, and will not function efficiently until the pulled fibers heal. If the muscle is torn, it will not function at all. A muscle that gradually becomes stiff, painful, and tender (often overnight) has probably been strained, and a few of its fibers may have torn. If you are in a great deal of pain or if the affected area becomes badly swollen, see your doctor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nThe doctor will evaluate the severity of your injury and may take X-rays to rule out a fracture. If the muscle is strained and does not seem to be severely damaged, he or she will probably recommend doing the RICE routine (see page 978) at home. For a more serious strain or a tear, the doctor may prescribe a pain reliever or recommend immobilizing the muscle to allow it to heal by, for example, using crutches for a leg injury or a sling for an arm injury. The doctor may also recommend physical therapy. As the pain and swelling subside, the therapist will show you how to gradually start exercising the injured muscle to help restore its movement and strength. If the muscle is torn, surgery may be necessary to repair it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment* > **Sprained Ligament**]\nIf excessive demands are made on a joint, the ligaments that hold the neighboring bones together and keep the joint in position may be stretched or torn. This type of injury is called a sprain. Any ligament can be sprained, but the ligaments at the knees, ankles, and fingers are the most susceptible because they generally receive the greatest force.\n\nMinor sprains cause no damage, but a joint will weaken eventually if its ligaments are repeatedly stretched and torn. For example, if the ankle joint is sprained often, it may begin to give way occasionally for no apparent reason. If a sprain is so severe that all the supporting ligaments are torn, the joint may be misshapen.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe amount of pain and tenderness from a sprained ligament depends on the extent of damage to the soft tissues that support the joint. A sprained ligament can often continue to function but is painful to use. The injury may also cause swelling and skin discoloration. If the pain from a sprain is severe or if it lasts for more than 2 or 3 days, see your doctor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nThe doctor will examine your joint and may take X-rays to rule out a fracture. If you have a mild sprain and the muscle does not seem to be severely damaged, he or she probably will recommend performing the RICE routine (see page 978) at home. After a day or so, start to exercise the joint as much as possible without forcing it to bear weight. When you are not exercising the strained muscle, keep it elevated to reduce the swelling.\n\nIf you have a severe sprain, your doctor may put a cast or splint on it. Occasionally, surgery is necessary to repair torn ligaments. After ligament surgery, your joint will be immobilized in a protective brace for a short time and you will be encouraged to use the joint to avoid stiffness. Ultrasound therapy, in which high-frequency sound waves are directed at the injured area, is used for some sprains to improve circulation and promote healing. Physical therapy can usually help strengthen the joint and enable it to heal more quickly.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment* > **Torn or Severed Tendon**]\nTendons are long, fibrous cords that connect muscles and bones, such as those that move the fingers and toes. The muscles that move the fingers are in the forearms and hand; those that move the toes are in the calves and feet. If you cut or severely injure your forearm or hand or your calf or foot, one or more tendons may be partly torn or completely severed. The Achilles tendon, which connects the calf muscles to the end of the heelbone, is the most frequently torn tendon.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nIf you cut or severely injure a tendon, you will be in extreme pain and may be unable to move one or more of your fingers or toes. Go to the nearest hospital emergency department as soon as possible if you think you may have severed a tendon.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis* > *Treatment*]\nDepending on the severity of the injury, a surgeon may immediately reconnect the severed ends of the tendon. Tendons are elastic and are under constant tension. When a tendon is severed, the two segments snap away from each other and may be difficult to retrieve. A large incision may be required to find them and reattach them. Tendon repairs are usually successful, although in some cases an affected finger or toe may be stiff and less movable than it was before the injury.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis* > **Tendons**]\nTendons are strong, flexible bands or cords of tissue that join muscles to bone.", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "pain", "relation": "caused by", "tail": "muscle strain"}, {"head": "swollen", "relation": "caused by", "tail": "muscle strain"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "evaluates", "tail": "[Event: severity of injury]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "takes X-rays for", "tail": "[Event: rule out fracture]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "sees", "tail": "[Event: doctor's visit]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: muscle strain]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment by doctor]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Your doctor may recommend ways to avoid overusing the tendon, such as changing your work habits. Noninfectious tenosynovitis can sometimes be treated with an injection of a corticosteroid drug to reduce the inflammation. Tenosynovitis caused by an infection requires prompt treatment with antibiotics to clear up the infection and possibly surgery to release pus from the affected area. If tenosynovitis persists, a simple surgical procedure to open the constricting tendon sheath will allow the tendon to move freely again.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > ***Fibromyalgia***]\nFibromyalgia, also called fibrositis or myofascial pain, is chronic stiffness and pain in fibrous tissues, usually deep inside the muscles. The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, but some doctors think it may result from an injury to the central nervous system or from a viral infection. The attacks of pain and stiffness seem to be associated with emotional stress. Although muscles knot up during an attack of fibromyalgia, the muscles themselves are not damaged in any way. Fibromyalgia is common, especially in people who are past middle age, and usually clears up on its own.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nDuring attacks of fibromyalgia, you are likely to have localized pain and slight swelling in the affected muscles. The tenderness seems to occur in specific areas called tender points throughout the body. Backache is common. People who have fibromyalgia are often tired because the pain interrupts their sleep. They also may have other symptoms, including anxiety or digestive disturbances such as irritable bowel syndrome (see page 765).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Sensitive areas of fibromyalgia**]\nA person is diagnosed with fibromyalgia if he or she has chronic pain in at least 11 of 18 specific sensitive areas, called tender points, on the body (dots). Some people with fibromyalgia also have pain elsewhere in their body.\n\n![Diagram showing two views of a human body (Front view and Back view) with black dots indicating sensitive areas for fibromyalgia diagnosis. The sensitive areas include the face, neck, chest, arms, and back.]()![](_page_1814_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Sensitive areas of fibromyalgia** > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nBecause symptoms of fibromyalgia are similar to those of other disorders, it is difficult to diagnose. Your doctor may make a diagnosis of fibromyalgia if you have had pain in at least 11 of the 18 sensitive areas in the body for longer than 3 months.\n\nSoaking in a hot bath and massaging sore muscles can provide some relief. Exercise such as walking or swimming increases muscle strength and helps reduce pain and stiffness. Taking aspirin or another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug can help relieve the pain. Your doctor may prescribe antidepressants, stronger pain relievers, or muscle-relaxant drugs to loosen muscles and help you sleep. A doctor may prescribe injections of a local anesthetic into the sensitive areas to relieve pain, sometimes with a corticosteroid drug to reduce inflammation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Sensitive areas of fibromyalgia** > **Ganglion**]\nA ganglion is a lump under the skin of the wrist or upper surface of the foot. A ganglion develops when a jellylike substance accumulates in a joint capsule or tendon sheath (the\n\ntissue surrounding a tendon) and causes it to balloon out.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe size of ganglia can vary. They may be soft or hard and are usually painless or only mildly painful. A ganglion on the wrist does not interfere with wrist movement, but a ganglion on the foot can make it difficult to wear some types of shoes. Although a ganglion is harmless, you should have your doctor look at it. A swelling of any kind could be a sign of a more serious condition.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA doctor can diagnose a ganglion by its appearance and feel. Your doctor may remove the jellylike substance from the ganglion with a syringe (aspiration) and inject the ganglion with a corticosteroid drug to reduce inflammation. Aspiration is effective only about half the time. In rare cases, ganglia that are especially painful are removed surgically. Do not try to eliminate a ganglion by smashing it with a book or other object; this folk remedy is ineffective and painful.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Ganglion**]\nThe wrist is one of the most common sites for ganglia. The cystlike swelling can vary from the size of a pea to, in rare cases, the size of a golf ball.\n\n![Diagram of a hand showing a ganglion, a cystlike swelling, located on the wrist.]()![](_page_1815_Picture_7.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Dupuytren's Contracture**]\nIn Dupuytren's contracture, also called palmar fasciitis, a layer of tough, fibrous, connective ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug", "relation": "treats", "tail": "tenosynovitis"}, {"head": "corticosteroid drug", "relation": "treats", "tail": "inflammation"}, {"head": "antibiotics", "relation": "treats", "tail": "infection"}, {"head": "surgery", "relation": "treats", "tail": "pus from the affected area"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "recommends", "tail": "[Event: changing work habits]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "prescribes", "tail": "[Event: taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "participates in", "tail": "[Event: resting the affected area]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment with antibiotics]"}, {"head": "[Event: overusing the tendon]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: tenosynovitis persists]"}]}, "status": "success"}

The doctor may need to cut open the tissues around the fracture to reposition the bones correctly.\n\nPlaster casts or lightweight plastic or resin casts and splints are usually used to hold the bone fragments together in correct alignment while they heal. Some bones are held together naturally and don't need a cast or splint. For a broken rib, nearby unbroken ribs and chest muscles may hold the broken rib in place. Your doctor can stabilize a fractured finger or toe until it heals by bandaging it to the adjacent finger or toe. In many cases, the broken ends of a fracture in an arm or leg are held in position internally by one or more metal screws, rods, or plates. Internal immobilization of an arm or leg allows the injured arm or leg to be used within a few days of the injury rather than weeks or months.\n\nIn children, fractures of the thighbone are often treated by putting the child in a body cast or by gradually applying tension to the bone to realign it using a system of weights and pulleys (called traction) and then putting the leg in a cast. Traction allows the broken ends of the bone to grow together correctly.\n\nBecause of the possibility of muscle atrophy (the wasting away of a muscle from disuse), it is important to use an injured arm or leg as soon as possible after immobilization. Follow your doctor's advice about when and how to move and exercise your injured arm or leg. Keep nearby joints as active as possible without disturbing the broken bones. Maintaining blood flow to the injured area helps prevent swelling and promote bone healing to heal.\n\nThe healing time for a fracture depends on many factors, including the bone that is fractured, the number of bone fragments, the person's age, and whether the fracture is open or closed. A child's broken finger may heal completely in 2 weeks, while an adult's tibia (the inner, thicker bone in the lower leg) may take 3 months or longer to heal.\n\nOccasionally a fracture does not heal. In this case, a doctor may need to perform a bone graft to promote healing. In a bone graft, small pieces of bone are taken from a bone bank (a collection of bone donated for transplantation) or from the person's body\n\n(often the pelvis) and packed around the break. In some cases, doctors use an artificial bone substitute for the graft. Electrical stimulation of the fracture with a weak electric current is sometimes used to accelerate bone healing.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Bunion]\nA bunion (which doctors call hallux valgus) is an enlargement of the bone at the base of the big toe. Bunions are common and tend to run in families.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Bunion > Bunion]\nIn the bone deformity known as a bunion, the bone at the base of the big toe is enlarged, causing the big toe to turn toward the other toes.\n\n![Diagram comparing a normal left foot and a right foot with a bunion. The foot with the bunion shows the big toe (hallux) deviated and enlarged, causing the bone at the base of the toe to protrude.]()![](_page_1821_Picture_5.jpeg)\n\nThe persistent pressure of a shoe on a bunion often leads to painful inflammation of the bursa (a fluid-filled sac that acts as a cushion at pressure points on the body) at the base of the joint (bursitis; see page 1002). Shoes that are tight or that fit poorly, especially shoes with high heels and pointed toes, can make bursitis worse.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms and Diagnosis]\nA bunion causes the big toe to point toward the other toes and the bones at the base of the big toe to enlarge and protrude out. If inflammation (bursitis) develops, the area becomes red, warm, swollen, and painful. Bunions are diagnosed by their appearance.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Treatment]\nIf you have a bunion, wear soft, wide, low-heeled shoes or use soft, cushioned, cotton-flannel bandages (which can be cut to size) to take pressure off the affected area. Taking aspirin or another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug can help relieve pain and reduce swelling. If these treatments fail to relieve the pain or if walking is difficult, your doctor may refer you to an orthopedic surgeon. The surgeon may perform a procedure called a bunionsectomy, in which the deformed bone is cut and straightened. After surgery, you may need to wear a cast or a special shoe for 3 to 6 weeks to protect the foot.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Osteoporosis]\nBone is living tissue that undergoes constant change—breaking down and rebuilding. Its central core is a light, flexible, strong structure composed of vertical and horizontal links that resemble interlacing ladders. In osteoporosis, bone loses the horizontal rungs, making it thin, porous, weak, and prone to fracture.

She hasn't had a period in 6 months. Could this be a problem for her health?\n\n**A.** Your daughter should see a doctor right away. She is at risk of developing osteoporosis at a young age. Many young women who exercise strenuously and fail to consume enough calories stop menstruating, which means that their body is not producing the female hormone estrogen in normal amounts. Estrogen is essential for building bones, and bones reach their peak strength and density in adolescence. Your daughter may need to take birth-control pills to restart her estrogen production and periods. The doctor may also recommend that she decrease her workout regimen, consume more calories, and take in 1,300 to 1,500 milligrams of calcium every day.\n\n**Q.** My mother and my sister both have osteoporosis. I'm 40 years old and I'm starting to worry that I might develop it too. Is there anything I can do now?\n\n**A.** Because of your family history of osteoporosis, you are at increased risk of developing it. The first thing you should do is have a bone density test to evaluate the strength of your bones, which can help determine your risk of developing osteoporosis or breaking a bone. If your bone density is lower than normal for your age and build, your doctor will probably recommend a number of strategies to prevent you from losing more bone and, possibly, help you build more bone. For example, getting a sufficient amount of calcium (about 1,500 milligrams each day) and doing as much weight-bearing exercise (such as walking) as you can each day will help keep your bones strong. Also, your doctor may prescribe a medication that helps maintain bone density or promotes bone growth.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Bone Density Tests]\nThe only way to determine if you have osteoporosis or are at risk of developing it is to have a test that evaluates the density of your bones, primarily in the spine, hip, or wrist (the most common sites of fracture). Some newer tests are able to measure bone density in the middle finger and heel or tibia (the inner, thicker bone in the lower leg). All bone density tests are painless, noninvasive, and safe; most use low-dose radiation or ultrasound. Your bone density is compared with two standard measurements—the bone density normally expected in someone your age, sex, and size; and the peak bone density\n\nof a healthy young adult of the same sex. This information helps your doctor evaluate your risk of developing osteoporosis and fractures and determine if you need treatment. You may have to repeat the test periodically to assess the rate at which you are losing bone or to monitor the effectiveness of any bone-strengthening treatment you are undergoing. The following are the most common bone density tests:\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Bone Density Tests > *Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry*]\nDEXA is an imaging technique that can measure bone density anywhere in the body. The spine and hip, and the wrist, heel, or finger are the sites most often tested. DEXA uses a very low dose of radiation and can detect bone loss of as little as 1 percent.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Bone Density Tests > *Single-energy X-ray absorptiometry*]\nSingle-energy X-ray absorptiometry measures bone density in the wrist or heel.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Bone Density Tests > *Quantitative ultrasound*]\nQuantitative ultrasound uses sound waves to measure bone density at the heel, tibia, and kneecap.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Bone Density Tests > *Quantitative CT scan*]\nA quantitative CT scan is usually used to measure bone density in the spine but can also be used at other sites, such as the wrist.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Bone Density Tests > *Radiographic absorptiometry*]\nRadiographic absorptiometry uses an X-ray of the hand and a small metal wedge to calculate bone density.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Osteopenia]\nIf the results of your bone density test fall below the normal range for a young adult, your doctor may tell you that you have osteopenia, a term that describes low bone mass. Osteopenia is not a disease, but it indicates that you may be at increased risk of developing osteoporosis. Your doctor will recommend steps you can take to prevent osteoporosis, such as taking calcium supplements and doing weight-bearing exercises.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Treatment]\nIf you have osteoporosis, your doctor will discuss with you the various treatments available to stem further bone loss and to help build up bone. He or she will suggest that you get as much weight-bearing exercise as possible to help keep your bones strong. Your doctor may also recommend that you wear pads called hip protectors, which fit tightly around each hip.

Oily fish such as salmon, vitamin D-fortified milk, and eggs are good sources of vitamin D. Although your body makes some vitamin D when you expose your skin to sunlight, you need to get most of your vitamin D from your diet or from supplements.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Weight-bearing exercise]\nWeight-bearing exercise such as walking, climbing stairs, and jogging stimulates new bone growth by putting stress on the bones. Lifting weights and doing exercises such as push-ups have the same effect. It's never too late to start exercising. If you have been diagnosed with osteoporosis, your doctor will probably recommend low-impact exercises such as walking and ask you to avoid activities such as tennis and golf that involve twisting.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Medication]\nMost of the medications used to treat osteoporosis (see previous page) are also used to prevent it when taken before significant bone loss has occurred.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Osteogenesis Imperfecta]\nOsteogenesis imperfecta, sometimes called brittle bone disease, is a genetic disorder that causes bones to break easily, often for no apparent reason. The disorder results from a genetic defect that affects the body's production of collagen, the major protein in connective tissue that provides structure and strength to the skeleton. A person with osteogenesis imperfecta has abnormal collagen or has less collagen than normal.\n\nOsteogenesis imperfecta has four forms, which can vary greatly in severity from one person to another. Type I is the mildest, most common form; type II is usually fatal at or within a year of birth; type III is progressively deforming; and type IV is moderately severe. People with the same type of osteogenesis imperfecta, even members of the same family, can have different symptoms that differ in severity.\n\nThe genetic defect occurs in a dominant gene that is either inherited or is the result of a spontaneous mutation (change) in a parent's egg or sperm cell before conception. For this reason, a person who has the disorder has a 50 percent chance of passing the gene (and therefore the disorder) on to each of his or her children. If you or a relative has osteogenesis imperfecta, talk to a genetic counselor (see page 952) to learn your risk of transmitting the disorder to a child.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe most obvious symptom of osteogenesis imperfecta is bones that break easily. Other symptoms of the most common form (type I) include loose joints and poor muscle tone; a blue, purple, or gray tint to the whites of the eyes; a triangular face; curvature of the spine; bone deformities; a gray tint to the teeth; or hearing loss beginning in the person's 20s or 30s. The less common, more severe forms can cause bone deformities, short stature, a barrel-shaped rib cage, or respiratory problems. The most severe form (type II) can be fatal at or shortly after birth, often because the child is born with underdeveloped lungs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nDoctors can usually diagnose osteogenesis imperfecta from the symptoms. The diagnosis is sometimes confirmed by a chemical analysis of the person's collagen or by a genetic test (see page 953). There is no cure for osteogenesis imperfecta. The goal of treatment is to prevent or control the symptoms and help the person achieve optimal bone and muscle strength to reduce the risk of fractures and to be as independent as possible. Many people with severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta must have surgery to strengthen their bones, dental and orthodontic procedures to correct and improve the appearance of their teeth, and physical therapy to enhance movement. In a surgical procedure called rodding, a metal rod is inserted through the length of the long bones to strengthen them and prevent or correct deformities. People with severe disability often must use wheelchairs, braces, or other mobility aids.\n\nIf you have osteogenesis imperfecta, exercise as much as possible (walking and swimming are good choices). Exercise strengthens your muscles and bones and helps you avoid fractures. Ask your doctor about other safe and appropriate exercises. Maintain a healthy weight, eat a nutritious diet, and don't smoke. An excessive intake of alcohol, caffeine, or corticosteroid medications can deplete bones and make them more fragile.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Osteomalacia]\nOsteomalacia, also called adult rickets, is softening and weakening of the bones. Osteomalacia results from the body's inability to absorb calcium or to deposit mineral salts on the protein structure of bone, usually because of a deficiency of vitamin D.

Tumors that result from cells that have spread from other parts of the body are called secondary tumors. Tumors that originate in bone are called primary bone tumors. Primary bone tumors are rare and usually are not cancerous. Noncancerous bone tumors include osteochondromas, osteomas, and cysts. Osteochondromas consist of bone and cartilage and tend to develop close to joints such as the knee or elbow. Osteomas are hard knobs of bone that can form on any bone but usually form on the skull. Cysts may develop in long bones, making the bones more susceptible to fracture.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > ***Symptoms and Diagnosis***]\nIf you develop a lump on a bone (or anywhere else on your body), see your doctor right away. He or she will examine you and may order X-rays, blood tests, a CT scan (see page 112), or an MRI (see page 113) to evaluate the lump.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > ***Treatment***]\nNoncancerous bone tumors such as osteochondromas and osteomas do not require treatment unless they are causing symptoms. Those that cause symptoms are usually removed surgically. Bone cysts may be treated by removing the fluid from the cyst and injecting some of the person's own bone marrow and bone tissue to rebuild the bone.\n\nPrimary bone tumors can usually be treated successfully with chemotherapy (see page 23) and by replacing the part of the bone that contains the tumor with a bone graft from another part of the body or from a human graft obtained from a bone bank. If the bone of an arm or leg is affected by a primary bone tumor, and the tumor does not initially respond to chemotherapy and radiation therapy (see page 23), the arm or leg may need to be amputated, followed by chemotherapy.\n\nSecondary bone cancer is usually treated with chemotherapy and analgesic drugs for pain relief. Radiation therapy may also provide relief from some symptoms. If a secondary tumor has become large enough to fracture the bone, a doctor may treat the break by inserting metal plates and rods and filling any empty, dead spaces in the bone with bone cement to provide stability. A bone graft from a bone bank or from another part of the body (such as the hip) may also be used to stabilize the bone and prevent fractures. If the tumor is in the spine, a rib graft may be used. Rib grafts have an advantage over regular bone grafts because the rib can be transferred to the spine while still connected to its blood supply, which enhances healing and reduces the risk of infection.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Joint Disorders]\nJoints provide a range of movement to parts of the body. Because you use one or more joints every time you move, you will quickly notice if any are not working properly. A highly movable joint, such as the hip, is bound together by fibrous bands called ligaments. Inside the ligaments is a fibrous joint capsule lined on the inside by the synovial membrane, a thin membrane that continuously produces tiny amounts of fluid to lubricate the joint. A tough, smooth tissue called cartilage covers the ends of the bones inside the joint, cushioning the bones and enabling them to glide easily against each other.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Osteoarthritis]\nOsteoarthritis, also called degenerative joint disease, occurs when cartilage (the tough, smooth tissue that covers the ends of bones in a joint) breaks down and gradually becomes rougher and thinner. Swelling can occur if the lining of the joint (called the synovial membrane) becomes irritated and produces excess fluid that collects inside the joint. As the cartilage wears away, growths of bone called bone spurs may form around the edges of the joint, making it look knobby and swollen. As the process continues, more cartilage wears away, causing the bones that meet at the joint to rub against each other. Because bone is very sensitive, this rubbing together can cause extreme pain and\n\nseverely reduce movement in the joint. The joints that are most often affected by osteoarthritis include the knees, hips, back, neck, toes, and fingers.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Osteoarthritis > *Risk Factors*]\nOsteoarthritis, which affects both women and men, is the most common joint disorder. Women usually develop it in their hands and knees, while men tend to develop it in their hips, knees, and back. The following factors can increase your risk of osteoarthritis:\n\n- **Age** People age 45 and older are most often affected by osteoarthritis. Most people over age 60 have some degree of osteoarthritis. Although age is an important factor in osteoarthritis, the disease is not an inevitable result of aging.\n- **Heredity** Some people inherit genes that make them more susceptible than other people to developing osteoarthritis.\n- **Being overweight** People who are overweight are more likely to develop osteoarthritis because extra weight can strain the joints, espec", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "breast", "relation": "cancer", "tail": "bone tumors"}, {"head": "prostate gland", "relation": "cancer", "tail": "bone tumors"}, {"head": "osteochondromas", "relation": "noncancerous bone tumor", "tail": "primary bone tumors"}, {"head": "osteomas", "relation": "noncancerous bone tumor", "tail": "primary bone tumors"}, {"head": "cysts", "relation": "noncancerous bone tumor", "tail": "primary bone tumors"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "cells", "relation": "spread from", "tail": "[Event: elsewhere in the body]"}, {"head": "tumors", "relation": "result from", "tail": "[Event: cells that have spread from other parts of the body]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: tumors result from cells that have spread from other parts of the body]", "relation": "are called", "tail": "[Event: secondary tumors]"}, {"head": "[Event: primary bone tumors originate in bone]", "relation": "are rare and usually are not cancerous", "tail": "[Event: primary bone tumors]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Exercise also helps you reach or maintain a healthy weight, which reduces stress on your joints. Pick an exercise program that works for you and fits your lifestyle and physical abilities. Doctors generally recommend a combination of stretching exercises, mild strengthening exercises (such as lifting weights), and low-impact aerobic exercises (such as swimming, walking, or bicycling).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Physical and occupational therapy]\nYour doctor may recommend that you work with a physical therapist to prevent or reduce joint stiffness. A physical therapist will help you improve the range of motion in your affected joints and strengthen the muscles around the joints to give the joints support. He or she can also provide splints, canes, crutches, walkers, and other mobility aids if you need them.\n\nAn occupational therapist will help you learn new ways to perform everyday activities such as bathing, dressing, walking, and climbing stairs. You will learn to move in ways that reduce discomfort and put less strain on your joints. An occupational therapist can help you make changes in your home or office that will enable you to get around and perform routine tasks more easily and safely.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Hot and cold treatments]\nApplying heat or cold directly to the affected joints can temporarily relieve pain, stiffness, and occasional swelling. Finding the most effective treatment for you may require trial and error. Do not apply either heat or cold for longer than 20 minutes at a time, and allow your skin to return to normal temperature between applications. Do not\n\nuse pain-relieving creams or rub your skin when using hot or cold treatments; you could injure your skin and not realize it because your sensation of pain is reduced.\n\nHeat is usually used to relax muscles and warm them up before exercising. Heat up your sore joints with a heating pad or hot pack or by sitting in a hot tub or heated pool. Many people who have osteoarthritis find that a hot shower in the morning is all they need to loosen their stiff joints.\n\nApplying cold can be helpful for short-term pain relief. Cooling a sore joint reduces pain by numbing the area. Never apply ice or cold packs directly to your skin—wrap them in a towel first. Use cold treatments carefully; the lack of feeling may cause you to overuse the sore joint.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Medication]\nBecause of the potential side effects of many drugs that are used for treating osteoarthritis, medication is usually recommended only after other treatments such as weight loss and exercise have been tried and have not been effective. Arthritis medications generally are used to reduce pain and tenderness in the joints. No drugs are available that can stop the progression of the disease or cure it.\n\nMany medications that are used to relieve osteoarthritis pain are available over the counter; some of the stronger ones are available only by prescription. All drugs used to treat osteoarthritis can cause side effects. If you are taking a medication for arthritis, tell your doctor immediately if you have any unusual symptoms. You may not have any problems until after you have been taking the medication regularly for a long time.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Medication > *Topical medications*]\nCreams, rubs, or sprays can be applied to the skin over a sore muscle or joint to temporarily relieve pain. Creams containing capsaicin (a substance found in hot peppers) reduce pain by blocking the ability of the nerve endings around the joint to send pain messages to the brain. Many of these medications are available over the counter. (Do not touch your eyes, nose, or genitals after applying capsaicin cream.)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Medication > *Pain relievers*]\nDrugs containing acetaminophen are usually prescribed for osteoarthritis because they don't cause stomach irritation like some other pain relievers such as aspirin. Acetaminophen is most effective when it is used regularly. However, acetaminophen does not relieve inflammation, and you should not take it regularly if you consume three or more alcoholic beverages a day because the combination can damage the liver.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Medication > *Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs*]\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketoprofen are often used to relieve the pain and inflammation of osteoarthritis. Many NSAIDs are available over the counter, but stronger ones require a doctor's prescription. NSAIDs such as celecoxib and rofecoxib may cause less stomach irritation than some of the older medications and are very effective for many people.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Medication > *Corticosteroids*]\nCorticosteroids are sometimes given in injections to reduce the inflammation and pain of severe osteoarthritis.

The procedure usually takes about 2 to 3 hours. You will be hospitalized for about a week after the surgery and will start physical therapy\n\nin the hospital. You will be encouraged to try to begin walking with support within a day or two after surgery. A physical therapist will teach you how to perform exercises to help strengthen the hip and teach you how to move the joint to avoid injuring your new hip.\n\nAt home, maintain a stretching and exercise program to help keep your new joint working properly. Full recovery can take up to 6 months, depending on your overall health, whether you have any complications (such as infection, blood clots, or joint dislocation), the success of your rehabilitation, and other factors. Hip replacements generally last from 15 to 20 years. Young or active people who have had hip replacements may eventually need to have surgery to repair or replace the artificial joint because of wear or loosening of the implant.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Hip Replacement > Hip replacement surgery]\nIn a hip replacement, the surgeon removes the end of the thighbone affected by arthritis (left) and creates a hollow channel in the bone. A metal shaft (with a ball at the head) is inserted into the channel in the thighbone (center). The surgeon creates a cavity in the hipbone and implants a plastic socket in the cavity. The metal ball is fitted into the plastic socket (right), forming an artificial hip joint that works like a natural ball-and-socket hip joint.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the steps of hip replacement surgery.

In this procedure, the surgeon makes the affected joint permanently immobile by using a bone graft and inserting metal screws, plates, and rods to hold the joint in place. Arthrodesis is performed only when the pain from osteoarthritis is so severe that immobilizing the joint is an improvement. This\n\nprocedure is usually performed on smaller joints such as those in the fingers, toes, ankles, or feet.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Hip Replacement > *Osteotomy*]\nOsteotomy is a surgical procedure most often performed on younger people who have a joint (usually a hip or knee) that has been unevenly damaged by osteoarthritis. The procedure is done to relieve stress on the cartilage and prevent further damage to the joint. During an osteotomy, the surgeon removes a small wedge of bone near the affected joint. Removing the piece of bone realigns the bone and improves the contact between the remaining, healthy areas of cartilage in the joint. In younger people, this procedure can delay joint replacement surgery for years.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Hip Replacement > *Arthroscopy*]\nArthroscopy, or “scoping” a joint, is an outpatient procedure that is used to examine and sometimes repair joints. The procedure is performed most often on knees and shoulders but can be done on other joints, including the hip. For arthroscopy, the doctor inserts a viewing tube (arthroscope) through a small incision into the fluid-filled space in the affected joint. Through the arthroscope the doctor can see any tissue damage and make necessary repairs. Although the repair may provide temporary relief of symptoms, it does not stop the progression of arthritis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Hip Replacement > *Cartilage transplantation*]\nUnlike bone, cartilage that is injured does not rejuvenate. Cartilage injuries commonly occur with ligament injuries. Damaged cartilage can increase friction in joints, sometimes leading to osteoarthritis. Cartilage transplantation uses live cells from donated cartilage. The donated cartilage must be transplanted within 72 hours. The graft is made of cartilage and bone (the person's bone heals into the donated bone supporting the cartilage).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Dislocated Joint]\nA joint is dislocated if the bones that normally connect in the joint are pulled apart, usually by a severe injury. Dislocations that are not caused by injury may be present from birth (such as congenital dislocation of the hip; see page 401) or may occur as a complication of rheumatoid arthritis (see page 918).\n\nA dislocation can occur repeatedly in a joint that has been weakened by an earlier injury.

Rest the affected area and use an ice pack to ease the pain and help absorb the excess fluid into your bloodstream. Take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as aspirin to help relieve pain and reduce inflammation.\n\nIf your symptoms persist, your doctor may remove the excess fluid through a needle and apply a bandage tightly over the area to prevent fluid from reaccumulating in the area. If the fluid contains pus, the doctor will prescribe antibiotics to help fight a bacterial infection. He or she may also inject a local anesthetic to relieve pain and a corticosteroid drug to reduce inflammation. Surgery to remove a bursa, called a bursectomy, is performed only if bursitis recurs repeatedly or if the bursa is infected and the infection seems to be spreading.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Preventing Bursitis]\nBursitis tends to develop in joints that are repeatedly placed under a lot of pressure. You can prevent bursitis by taking steps to protect your joints from prolonged pressure. For example, if you spend much of your working day kneeling, as carpet layers or roofers do, wear knee pads to reduce pressure on the bursae of your kneecaps. To prevent bursitis in your elbow, avoid resting your elbows on the table or desk while\n\nworking or studying. Wear elbow and knee pads during athletic activities to cushion your elbows and knees from falls that could cause bursitis. Bursitis in the heel can result from wearing shoes that are too tight or that don't fit properly, or from running long distances. Wearing high heels or shoes that are too tight can irritate bunions and cause bursitis in the joint at the base of the big toe.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Baker's Cysts**]\nBaker's cysts are fluid-filled sacs that form behind the knee. The cyst usually develops from inflammation of the knee joint that causes the membrane around the joint to swell backward and, sometimes, down into the calf muscles. Inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (see page 918) and osteoarthritis (see page 996), or overuse of the knee can cause Baker's cysts to develop.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Baker's Cysts** > *Symptoms*]\nBaker's cysts usually produce no symptoms, but movement can cause pain behind the knee or upper calf. If the cysts become inflamed or rupture, however, they can cause persistent discomfort or pain.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Baker's Cysts** > *Diagnosis*]\nA doctor usually can diagnose Baker's cysts by their appearance and feel. Because the cysts can cause pain and swelling behind the knee and in the upper calf, a doctor may want to rule out a blood clot (deep vein thrombosis; see page 605), which has the same symptoms. He or she may recommend an ultrasound (see page 111) or MRI (see page 113) of the knee.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Baker's Cysts** > *Treatment*]\nIf the cyst is not causing symptoms, a doctor may recommend monitoring it for a few months to see if it goes away on its own. If it is large or is causing pain or other symptoms, the doctor will probably recommend removing it surgically in an outpatient procedure. If an abnormality in the joint itself caused the cyst, the abnormality may need to be corrected surgically to prevent another cyst from forming.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Frozen Shoulder]\nFrozen shoulder is a condition in which the joint capsule (the tough, fibrous tissue that encloses a joint) becomes thick, inflamed, and forms scar tissue. Frozen shoulder usually begins with a minor injury or condition such as tendinitis (see page 984) or bursitis (see page 1002) that causes chronic pain and makes it difficult or impossible to move the shoulder. This lack of use leads to more stiffness, which progresses to further disuse, weakening of the tissues, and loss of function of the shoulder.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Frozen Shoulder > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nAt first, a frozen shoulder is difficult to move, and the slightest movement causes pain. The discomfort may be worse at night. The pain may eventually subside, but the shoulder will be permanently impaired unless it is treated. To diagnose frozen shoulder, the doctor moves your arm to evaluate the range of motion of your shoulder joint.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Frozen Shoulder > *Treatment*]\nIf you have frozen shoulder, your doctor may prescribe a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as aspirin to help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. He or she may refer you to a physical therapist, who will teach you how to improve the mobility of your shoulder with exercises. (A frozen shoulder should be kept in motion as much as possible.)

In some cases, the pain can extend to the ear or even as far as the shoulder. It may be difficult to open the jaw fully, and your jaw may make clicking or snapping noises.\n\nIf you have symptoms of TMD, your doctor will examine your face and jaw. He or she may recommend X-rays and laboratory tests to rule out other disorders, but tests performed on people with TMD often reveal no physical abnormality.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTo treat TMD and relieve painful spasms, your doctor may recommend massage, heat therapy or ice packs, anesthetic injections or sprays, and pain relievers. He or she will tell you to eat soft foods and avoid extreme movements of your jaw, such as yawning widely or opening your mouth wide to eat, or clenching or grinding your teeth. Ask your doctor or dentist if you should use a nightguard (see page 1111) to reduce clenching or grinding of the teeth. Using a nightguard may also help ease muscle tension around the jaw and prevent damage to the teeth.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Back and Neck Problems]\nThe spine, also called the spinal column or backbone, stretches from the base of the skull to the bottom of the buttocks. The spine consists of more than 30 separate bones called vertebrae. Strong ligaments link the vertebrae, and flexible, flattened disks lie between them. Each disk is constructed of a tough, fibrous outer covering wrapped around a jellylike inner substance, which provides enough elasticity to permit some movement over the entire spine. However, this construction also limits flexibility. For this reason, if you twist the wrong way or strain any part of your spine, it can cause pain in the vertebrae and the muscles and ligaments that connect the vertebrae.\n\nThe back is also especially susceptible to pain because the spinal cord, which is a major part of the central nervous system, is in a channel that runs the length of the spine. Peripheral nerves pass through narrow side channels of the spine on their way to and from the rest of the body. As a result, any problem with a vertebra, supportive ligament, or disk can affect nerves that supply the arms and legs and lead to pain and weakness in an arm or leg.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Common Sites of Back Pain]\nBack pain is usually centered in three common places: the lower back, the coccyx, and the area around the sciatic nerve. See your doctor whenever you have back pain that persists for more than 3 or 4 days.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Common Sites of Back Pain > *Lower Back Pain*]\nPain in the lower part of the back is centered in the small of the back and spreads out from there. It is often caused by unusual exertion, such as moving furniture or digging in the garden. It may develop suddenly or gradually and can be mild or severe. Sometimes you may be completely unable to move. Doctors disagree about the exact cause of lower back pain, but it probably results from a combination of pulled or strained muscles (see page 983), muscle spasms, and sprained ligaments (see page 983).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Common Sites of Back Pain > *Coccyx*]\nPain in the area of the coccyx, at the base of the spine, can be continuous and worsen when you sit. Pain in the coccyx may be caused by falling on or otherwise hitting the base of the spine. Women may temporarily experience pain in this area after giving birth. You may be able to relieve the pain by sitting on a soft cushion designed specifically for this purpose.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Common Sites of Back Pain > *Sciatic Nerve*]\nThe sciatic nerve is the longest nerve in the body. It branches out to the lower part of the body through the buttocks and down each leg. Sciatica is pain caused by pressure on the sciatic nerve as it leaves the spinal cord. The pressure is usually caused by a prolapsed disk (see next page) or osteoarthritis (see page 996) in the spine. You may feel burning pain shooting into your buttocks and down the back of your thigh, along with numbness and tingling.

It has three parts—the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear. The outer ear includes the part of the ear that we see—folds of skin and cartilage called the pinna—and the ear canal, a passage about  $\\frac{3}{4}$  inch long that leads from the pinna to the eardrum. The opening of the ear canal is surrounded by cartilage, which is covered with skin that contains wax-producing glands and hairs. The bone of the deeper part of the canal is lined with a very thin layer of skin. A thin membrane called the eardrum stretches across the inside end of the outer ear canal, separating the outer ear from the middle ear.\n\nThe middle ear is a small cavity between the eardrum and the inner ear that is bridged by three small, interconnected bones (the ossicles)—the hammer, the anvil, and the stirrup. The hammer is attached to the inner lining of the eardrum. A ligament (a band of fibrous tissue) attaches the stirrup to an opening (the oval window) that leads to the inner ear. The anvil lies between the hammer and the stirrup and is attached to both.\n\nOne of the openings in the middle ear leads into the mastoid portion of the temporal bone (the bone that contains all of the internal structures of the ear). Two openings lead into the inner ear. Another opening, the eustachian tube, leads to the back of the nose. The eustachian tube equalizes air pressure on the inside of the eardrum with the environmental air pressure. Sometimes the eustachian tube becomes blocked and then clears again; this sudden equalization of air pressure feels as if your ear has popped.\n\nThe inner ear consists of several fluid-filled chambers—the cochlea (which is involved in hearing) and the semicircular canals and vestibule (which are involved in balance and together form the vestibular labyrinth). The vestibular labyrinth and the cochlea relay hearing and balance information from the inner ear to the brain via the vestibulocochlear nerve.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > How the Ear Works > How You Hear]\nSound starts as a disturbance of the air, which produces sound waves. The outer ear collects the sound waves and funnels them into the middle ear, which consists of the eardrum, the hammer, the anvil, the stirrup, and the eustachian tube. The sound waves hit the eardrum and make it vibrate. The vibrations then pass into the inner ear, which consists of the semicircular canals, the vestibule, and the cochlea. Tiny hairs that line the cochlea convert the vibrations in the fluid into electrical nerve impulses, which are transmitted to the brain via the vestibulocochlear nerve. The cochlea also transmits information about balance to the brain via the cochlear nerve.\n\nMost sounds reach you through this process, which is supplemented by vibrations that are conducted through the bones of the skull to the inner ear. You hear your own voice mainly through this supplemental type of hearing.\n\n![Diagram of the human ear showing the outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear structures. Labeled parts include: Pinna, Outer ear canal, Eardrum, Hammer, Anvil, Stirrup, Semicircular canals, Vestibule, Cochlea, Eustachian tube, Vestibulocochlear nerve, and the spiral shape of the inner ear.]()![](_page_1868_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > How the Ear Works > How You Keep Your Balance]\nYour brain constantly monitors the position and movement of your head and body to enable you to keep your balance. A structure called the vestibular labyrinth in the inner ear monitors the movement of the head by means of three semicircular canals that sit at right angles to each other. Whatever way you move your head—nod it, shake it, or tilt it—at least one of the semicircular canals will detect the movement and relay the information to your brain. Other areas of the vestibule provide information to the brain about the pull of gravity. The brain processes this input with sensory information from your eyes, and from the muscles and joints in your body, to\n\nassess your exact position and the movements you need to make to keep your balance.\n\nVertigo is a false sense that you or your surroundings are moving. A person with vertigo may also experience nausea, vomiting, and loss of balance. Vertigo is usually a symptom of disorders of the inner ear, the part of the ear that senses movement and maintains balance.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > How the Ear Works > The vestibular labyrinth]\n![Diagram of the vestibular labyrinth (inner ear).

The exact cause of labyrinthitis is not known, but it usually follows a viral or bacterial infection in the ear or upper respiratory tract.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptom of labyrinthitis is a false sense that you or your surroundings are moving (vertigo; see page 1012). If you move your head even slightly, the vertigo gets worse. In most cases, the vertigo is accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting. Labyrinthitis may also cause ringing or other noises in the ear (tinnitus; see page 1020) or hearing loss (see page 1016). If you have severe vertigo, have someone take you to your doctor's office or the nearest hospital emergency department immediately.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nTo diagnose labyrinthitis, a doctor will take a detailed health history and examine your ears. You may also have hearing tests and a CT scan (see page 112) or an MRI (see page 113) to rule out other possible causes of vertigo.\n\nIf the vertigo is associated with labyrinthitis, your doctor may recommend that you try to stay still and avoid sudden changes of position during episodes. He or she may prescribe medications such as meclizine or diazepam to relieve the nausea and vomiting. To treat labyrinthitis caused by bacteria, a doctor prescribes antibiotics. For labyrinthitis caused by a virus, a doctor may prescribe medication to relieve the symptoms.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Otosclerosis]\nOtosclerosis is an abnormal growth of bone in the inner ear that prevents the stirrup (one of the tiny bones in the inner ear) from transmitting sound waves to the inner ear, resulting in conductive hearing loss (see page 1016) in the affected ear. In most cases, both ears are affected, either simultaneously or one after the other. As the disease progresses, some sensorineural hearing loss (see page 1016) may occur.\n\nThe cause of otosclerosis is not fully understood, but it tends to run in families. The disorder occurs more often in middle-aged women than in men, and in whites more frequently than in blacks. Hormonal changes during pregnancy can accelerate the\n\nhearing loss in some women. Without treatment, otosclerosis can result in significant conductive hearing loss, requiring a person to wear a hearing aid to hear normal conversation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptom of otosclerosis is gradual hearing loss. In rare cases, primarily in children, the hearing loss progresses quickly. Some people may also experience a false sense that they or their surroundings are moving (vertigo; see page 1012) or hear ringing or other noises in their ears (tinnitus; see page 1020).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Otosclerosis]\nIn otosclerosis, an abnormal growth of bone in the ear prevents the stirrup from properly transmitting sounds to the inner ear, causing hearing loss in that ear.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the anatomy of the ear, showing the Eardrum, Stirrup, Hammer, and Anvil. An abnormal bone growth is indicated near the stirrup, which is the cause of hearing loss in otosclerosis.]()![](_page_1873_Picture_5.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Noise and Hearing Loss]\nSound is a series of air-pressure waves traveling through the atmosphere alternating between high pressure and low pressure. The loudness of sound is measured in units called decibels by an instrument called a decibel meter. Sounds that are softer than 10 decibels are very difficult for the human ear to hear, while sounds that are 120 decibels or more are usually painful to the ear. A sound loud enough to cause pain can damage your hearing, often permanently. “Noise” is a term usually used to describe a variety of loud sounds that a person finds unpleasant.\n\nProlonged exposure to noise (especially high-pitched noise) at or above 90 decibels can damage the sensitive hair cells lining the cochlea (the part of the ear that transmits sound information to the brain) and cause partial to severe hearing loss. Being constantly exposed to loud machinery (such as jackhammers or tractors) or listening to extremely loud music (whether on headphones or at a rock concert) can harm your hearing. A one-time or brief exposure to a loud noise (such as a gunshot or from fireworks) can cause temporary hearing loss.\n\n| Decibels | Type of Sound                          | Effect on Hearing |\n|----------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| 10       | Barely audible                         | Safe              |\n| 20       | Ticking watch                          | Safe              |\n| 30       | Soft whisper at 16 feet                | Safe              |\n| 40       | Suburban street (no traffic)           | Safe              |\n| 50       | Interior of typical urban home         | Safe              |\n| 60       | Normal conversation                    | Safe              |\n| 70       | Noisy restaurant     ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Labyrinthitis", "relation": "caused by", "tail": "viral or bacterial infection"}, {"head": "vertigo", "relation": "accompanied by", "tail": "severe nausea and vomiting"}, {"head": "tinnitus", "relation": "may also cause", "tail": "hearing loss"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "you or your surroundings", "relation": "experience", "tail": "[Event: vertigo]"}, {"head": "your head", "relation": "move", "tail": "[Event: worsening of vertigo]"}, {"head": "someone", "relation": "take you to", "tail": "[Event: doctor's office visit]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: viral or bacterial infection]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: Labyrinthitis]"}, {"head": "[Event: worsening of vertigo]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: severe nausea and vomiting]"}]}, "status": "success"}

He or she may refer you to an otolaryngologist (a doctor who specializes in disorders of the ear, nose, and throat) or an otologist (a doctor who specializes in disorders of the ear). You will have an examination of your ears, and you may have simple hearing tests. You may also be referred to an audiologist (a health care professional who specializes in hearing evaluation and treatment), who may perform\n\nmore sophisticated tests such as those described below. These tests help diagnose the cause of hearing loss and evaluate the degree of hearing loss.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Audiometry tests]\nAudiometry tests evaluate a person's overall ability to hear, and determine whether hearing loss is conductive or sensorineural. These tests usually take place in a soundproof room. Pure tone tests measure a person's ability to hear tones and frequencies at different volumes. Speech tests measure a person's ability to distinguish and understand words spoken at different volumes. Impedance or compliance tests, also called tympanometry, measure the ability of the eardrum to reflect sound waves.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Audiometry tests > *Pure tone test*]\nThe pure tone test consists of two parts. The first part of the test, called the air conduction test, measures how well you hear sounds conducted through the air. In this test, you listen through earphones, one ear at a time, to sound frequencies that range from low tones to high tones. For each frequency, the sound starts at an audible level and decreases in loudness until you can barely hear it. The softest level at which a tone can be recognized at least 50 percent of the time is your threshold for that frequency.\n\nThe second part of the test, called the bone-conduction test, measures how well sounds are conducted through the bones of your head. In this test, a special headphone is placed on the mastoid (the bone directly behind each ear) of one ear. To test one ear, the audiologist puts a competing, or masking, sound into the headphone of the ear that isn't being tested. As in the first part of the test, sound frequencies that range from low tones to high tones are sent through the headphone on the mastoid to find your threshold. The results of both tests are recorded on the same graph.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Audiometry tests > *Speech reception test*]\nThe speech reception test measures how well a person can hear and understand words at different volumes. In this test, you listen through headphones to words spoken live or on a recording at different volumes, and you are asked to repeat them. The words start at an audible level and decrease in volume. Your speech reception threshold is the softest level at which you can recognize a two-syllable word at least 50 percent of the time.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Audiometry tests > *Speech discrimination test*]\nThe speech discrimination test measures how well a person can distinguish words. In this test, you listen through headphones to a list of one-syllable words at a volume that is comfortable for you. You are asked to repeat the words. Your score is the percentage\n\nof words you have correct. A score of 90 percent or better indicates normal hearing.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Audiometry tests > *Impedance test*]\nIn a healthy ear, the air pressure inside and outside the eardrum is the same. This equilibrium allows the eardrum to vibrate freely when sound waves hit it. The vibrations pass through the ear to enable us to hear, and reflect back into the air. Too much or too little air pressure on the inner side of the eardrum makes the eardrum too stiff to conduct sounds properly—more sound is reflected back, and less passes through to the inner ear.\n\nThe impedance test, or tympanometry, measures the ability of the eardrum to pass sound waves to the inner ear and detects abnormal air pressure in the middle ear, fluid in the middle ear, perforation of the eardrum, and disorders of the tiny sound-conducting bones of the middle ear. In this test, a probe covered with an airtight material (usually plastic) is inserted into the outer ear canal to seal the entrance to the ear. A transmitter in the probe pumps air through the probe to change the air pressure in the ear canal and then directs sounds to the eardrum. A receiver in the probe measures how well the eardrum absorbs the sounds. The probe has a tiny speaker (sound transmitter) and a tiny microphone (sound receiver). The difference between the sound transmitted and the sound received is the sound absorbed. Several measurements are made at different pressure levels.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Audiometry tests > *Brain stem auditory evoked response test*]\nThe brain stem auditory evoked response test is a computerized hearing test that measures electrical responses in the brain stem (the part of the brain that controls basic functions) in reaction to sounds.", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "refer", "tail": "otolaryngologist"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "refer", "tail": "otologist"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "refer", "tail": "audiologist"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "examine", "tail": "[Event: examination of ears]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "undergo", "tail": "[Event: hearing tests]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "refer", "tail": "[Event: referral to audiologist]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: examination of ears]", "relation": "lead to", "tail": "[Event: hearing tests]"}]}, "status": "success"}

People who have chronic ear drainage or who are allergic to the plastic used in hearing aids may not be able to wear a standard hearing aid. For these people, an implantable bone conduction hearing device may be used to help improve hearing.\n\nTo implant a bone conduction hearing device, a surgeon makes an incision in the scalp behind the ear, drills a hole in the outer part of the skull, and screws a small device that contains a magnet in the hole. The person wears a microphone that converts sound waves into electrical impulses that stimulate the magnet, making it vibrate. The brain perceives the vibrations as sounds.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Hearing aids > Cochlear implants]\nSome children are born with total sensorineural hearing loss, or nerve deafness, and some children and adults develop the disorder as a result of damage to the inner ear. To help a person with severe sensorineural hearing loss understand speech better, a tiny electronic device called a cochlear implant can be surgically implanted in the inner ear. Cochlear implants produce sound by stimulating undamaged nerves in the inner ear, not by amplifying sound as a hearing aid does. Cochlear implants do not restore normal hearing—they help a person distinguish speech sounds better. The benefits of cochlear implants have far exceeded expectations—most people who have cochlear implants even have some degree of hearing over the telephone (without lipreading cues). Previously used only for people with total hearing loss, the devices are being implanted in children younger than 1 year old and in adults who have some remaining hearing.\n\nThe devices are usually implanted in only one ear, but implanting them in both ears may be an option in the future. About 4 to 6 weeks after surgery to implant the receiver-stimulator (see illustration), the person is fitted with the externally worn parts of the device. Using a computer, technicians program the speech processor to make sure the frequency and pitch of the transmitted sounds are tailored to the person's needs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Assistive devices]\nThere are many different kinds of assistive devices. Assistive devices can improve a person's hearing, alert a person when a sound occurs, or help a person communicate.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Assistive devices > How a cochlear implant works]\nA cochlear implant has both internal and external parts. A microphone, which is worn like a behind-the-ear hearing aid, receives incoming sound from the environment and sends it through a thin cord to a speech processor, which fits into a pocket or can be worn on a belt or under or over clothing. (Newer, smaller speech processors can be worn behind the ear.) The speech processor converts the sounds into electrical signals that it sends to the transmitting coil, which is held in place against the skin by magnetic attraction to the receiver-stimulator implanted under the skin. The transmitting coil sends the electrical signals through the skin to the receiver-stimulator, which activates electrodes in the electrode array that stimulate specific groups of nerve fibers in the ear. The vestibulocochlear nerve transmits the signals to the brain, which interprets them as sound.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the components of a hearing aid system.

Infections of the middle ear are often caused by bacteria or viruses, which enter the middle ear via the bloodstream, through a perforated\n\neardrum, or along the eustachian tube from the back of the nasal cavity. A buildup of fluid in the middle ear is a frequent cause of hearing loss in middle ear disorders, especially in children.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Middle Ear > Middle ear]\n![Diagram of the middle ear showing the Eardrum, Hammer, Anvil, Stirrup, and Eustachian tube.]()![](_page_1886_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Middle Ear > Barotrauma]\nNormally, because of air passing through the eustachian tube, the air pressure in the middle ear is the same as the air pressure in the outer ear. But if the eustachian tube becomes blocked—such as from a cold, sinus infection, or nasal allergies—an imbalance between the pressure in the middle ear and the pressure in the outer ear can result. This imbalance in pressure, called barotrauma, can stretch the eardrum, causing pain.\n\nBarotrauma often occurs when a person who has a nose or throat infection travels in an airplane. The ascent of the plane lowers the air pressure in the cabin. If the eustachian tube does not open normally, air pressure in the middle ear becomes greater than the air pressure in the cabin. This trapped air is usually not a problem because it can be absorbed by the bloodstream or escape through the eustachian tube. However, when the airplane descends and the cabin pressure rises, the middle ear air pressure may not be equalized by the eustachian tube opening, and a vacuum develops in the middle ear. The vacuum causes the eardrum to stretch, which can be painful.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Middle Ear > Symptoms]\nThe symptoms of barotrauma can include moderate to severe pain in the ear, a plugged feeling in the ears, and hearing loss. You may also hear noises in the ear (tinnitus; see previous page) and feel dizzy. If the eardrum was stretched during an airplane trip, the pain usually stops when the plane lands, although the pain may persist even after the pressure inside and outside the ear is the same. Other symptoms, such as hearing loss, usually clear up within 3 to 5 hours.\n\nRarely, a severe imbalance in pressure can cause the eardrum to rupture (see next page), immediately relieving the pain and pressure. (You may notice a few drops of blood in your ear.) In most cases, the ruptured eardrum heals on its own. Barotrauma may also cause bleeding into the middle ear, which a doctor can see only with a lighted viewing instrument called an otoscope. The blood will reduce hearing for a few days until it is reabsorbed.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Middle Ear > Ear examination]\nDoctors examine the ears with a lighted viewing instrument called an otoscope.

He or she may also examine your ear with a microscope and may order a CT scan (see page 112) of your head to determine if the infection has spread.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTo treat a chronic middle ear infection, a doctor usually cleans out the ear and prescribes eardrops that contain an antibiotic (to kill the bacteria) and a corticosteroid (to reduce inflammation) or an oral antibacterial medication.\n\nIf the infection does not respond to medication, the doctor may recommend a surgical procedure called tympanoplasty to remove the remaining infected tissue and mend the tiny bones in the middle ear or replace them with plastic substitutes. He or she will then repair the eroded eardrum with a tissue graft. In many cases, the middle ear can be rebuilt to restore some hearing.\n\nIf a child has recurring middle ear infections, his or her adenoids (lymph tissue that lies on each side of the back wall of the nose and the upper part of the throat) may be acting as a reservoir for the infection-causing bacteria. In these cases, doctors sometimes recommend removing the adenoids or inserting tubes into the child's ears (myringotomy; see page 418).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Cholesteatoma**]\nA cholesteatoma is an abnormal growth of the skin of the eardrum into the middle ear. The skin forms a cyst that fills with dead skin cells shed by the eardrum. Over time, the cyst becomes infected repeatedly and can erode the bone that lines the middle ear cavity and the delicate bones in the middle ear. A cholesteatoma can also erode the protective bone between the middle ear and the facial nerve, damage the areas of the middle ear responsible for balance and hearing, and damage the brain, including its covering and\n\nblood supply. A cholesteatoma may be congenital (present at birth), but it is usually caused by recurring middle ear infections.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of a cholesteatoma can include headache, earache, weakness of the facial muscles, dizziness, and mild to moderately severe conductive hearing loss (see page 1016). In some cases, pus seeps from the ear. If a cholesteatoma erodes the roof of the middle ear cavity, you may have paralysis of the facial nerves, a false sense that you or your surroundings are moving (vertigo; see page 1012), or profound sensorineural hearing loss (see page 1016). A cholesteatoma that infects the brain can produce a pocket of pus between the membrane covering the brain and spinal cord and the bones of the skull or spine (epidural abscess; see page 695) or inflammation of the membranes that surround and protect the brain and spinal cord (meningitis; see page 692). An abscess also can form behind the ear.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose a cholesteatoma, a doctor will take a detailed health history and examine the affected ear with a lighted viewing instrument called an otoscope. If the doctor suspects that you have a cholesteatoma, he or she will refer you to an otolaryngologist (a doctor who specializes in disorders of the ear, nose, and throat). The otolaryngologist will examine you and may perform hearing tests (see page 1016).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTo treat a cholesteatoma that is small or at an early stage, the otolaryngologist may remove it and thoroughly clean out the middle ear cavity in a relatively simple surgical procedure performed through the ear canal. If the cholesteatoma is large or at a later stage, damage to the middle ear may be extensive. In this case, removal of the cholesteatoma is more complicated, involving a procedure to rebuild the hearing structures, repair the broken eardrum, and clean out the mastoid bone (the bone behind the ear), often leaving it open to the ear canal. If your hearing is badly damaged by the cholesteatoma or its treatment, a hearing aid (see page 1018) may be helpful.\n\nCholesteatomas sometimes recur. For this reason, the otolaryngologist probably will want to examine your ears at least once a year.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Outer Ear]\nThe lining of the outer ear canal is an extension of the skin of the visible ear. Most disorders of the outer ear are skin disorders. While the symptoms can be bothersome, disorders of the outer ear are generally not as serious as middle and inner ear disorders because they do not permanently affect the delicate mechanisms of hearing and balance.\n\n[OLDER", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "infection", "relation": "cause", "tail": "hearing loss"}, {"head": "chronic middle ear infection", "relation": "treats", "tail": "otolaryngologist"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "refer", "tail": "[Event: to an otolaryngologist]"}, {"head": "otolaryngologist", "relation": "examine", "tail": "[Event: with a lighted viewing instrument called an otoscope]"}, {"head": "otolaryngologist", "relation": "perform", "tail": "[Event: a hearing test]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment by an otolaryngologist]"}, {"head": "[Event: examination with a lighted viewing instrument called an otoscope]", "relation": "may lead to", "tail": "[Event: a hearing test]"}]}, "status": "success"}

On the visible portion of the ear, a noncancerous tumor may develop as a painless lump. In the ear canal, the tumor may be a hard growth of bony tissue called an osteoma.\n\nCancerous tumors on the visible part of the ear can resemble wartlike growths, benign tumors, or ulcers or sores that don't heal. Cancerous tumors of the outer ear are almost always skin cancers.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of an osteoma can include pain, an accumulation of wax in the ear, and hearing loss. In most people, however, osteomas don't cause any symptoms.\n\nIn cancerous tumors of the outer ear, the ulcers or sores may bleed and eventually become painful. In advanced stages, cancerous tumors in the ear canal cause intense earaches and bloody drainage. If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor immediately.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nTo diagnose tumors of the outer ear, a doctor will take a detailed health history and examine the affected ear. Treatment is usually not necessary for a noncancerous tumor that does not cause symptoms. However, if the tumor grows and causes pain or hearing loss, a doctor can usually remove it in a minor surgical procedure performed through the ear canal.\n\nFor a cancerous tumor on the visible part of the ear, a doctor will recommend surgery and radiation therapy (see page 23), alone or in combination. During surgery, the tumor and some of the visible portion of the ear are removed. Tumors in the ear canal may require a procedure called mastoidectomy, in which the mastoid bone (the bone behind the ear) is opened to remove any infected or cancerous tissue.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Eye Disorders]\nThe eye is a complex and delicate structure. Each eyeball is a sphere about 1 inch in diameter, covered by three layers of tissue. The tough, white, outer layer, called the sclera, maintains the shape and size of the eyeball. Covering the sclera at the front of the eye is a transparent mucous membrane called the conjunctiva, which also lines the inside of the eyelids. At the front of the sclera is a transparent, dome-shaped, protective covering called the cornea.\n\nThe middle layer of tissue, which lies beneath the sclera, is called the choroid. The choroid contains blood vessels that supply the tissues of the eye with oxygen and nutrients. Toward the front of the eye, the choroid forms a circular ring with muscles called the ciliary body. Attached to the front of the ciliary body is the colored part of the eye, a circular curtain containing muscle fibers, called the iris. In the center of the iris is an opening called the pupil, through which light enters the eye. The dilating (widening) and constricting (narrowing) of the pupil, which are controlled by the muscle fibers of the iris, regulate the amount of light that enters the eye.\n\nDirectly behind the iris and pupil is a transparent, elastic structure called the lens, which is attached to the ciliary body. Contraction of the ciliary body muscles changes the shape of the lens and enables the eye to focus. The space between the cornea and the lens is filled with a clear, watery liquid called aqueous fluid. The space behind the lens is filled with a substance called vitreous fluid, which makes up the mass of the inside of the eyeball.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Structure of the eye]\nDiagram illustrating the Front of the Eye, showing the following labeled structures:\n\n- Sclera\n- Choroid\n- Retina\n- Optic disc\n- Optic nerve\n- Retinal blood vessels\n- Ciliary body and ciliary body muscles\n- Cornea\n- Anterior chamber (contains aqueous fluid)\n- Lens\n- Iris\n- Conjunctiva\n- Vitreous fluid\n\n![](_page_1898_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nFront of the eye\n\nDiagram illustrating the Eye, showing the following labeled structures:\n\n- Eye lid\n- Iris\n- Pupil\n- Conjunctiva (transparent covering)\n- Sclera (white of the eye)\n\n![](_page_1898_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Vision]\nWhen you look at an object, light rays from the object pass through the cornea, pupil, and lens of the eye, which project an upside-down image of the object onto the retina. The retina converts the image into nerve impulses and transmits the impulses to your brain via the optic nerve. Your brain interprets the information it receives from the retina, and you see the object right side up.\n\n![Diagram of the human eye showing the path of light from an object to the retina.

In normal vision, the light focuses directly on the retina, producing a sharp, clear image. However, if a person has a focusing disorder, the light focuses either behind or in front of the retina, producing a blurred image. The four most common focusing disorders are nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, and presbyopia.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Focusing Disorders > Normal vision]\nThe cornea and lens of the eye act as convex (curved outward) lenses to refract (bend) light rays from a viewed object and focus them on the retina. The retina and the brain work together to transform these light rays into the image you see when you look at an object.\n\n![Diagram of the human eye showing the path of light rays entering the eye.

Light rays entering the eye are shown converging on the Retina.]()![](_page_1903_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Nearsightedness]\nIn nearsightedness (also called myopia), either the eyeball is too long from front to back, or the focusing power of the cornea and lens is too great. As a result, images of distant objects are focused in front of the retina and are blurred. Images of nearby objects are focused on the retina and are usually sharp and clear.\n\nAbout one in every five Americans is nearsighted. The disorder usually begins to develop at about age 12 and may gradually worsen until about age 30. Nearsightedness tends to run in families.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptom of nearsightedness is blurred vision when viewing distant objects. Constant straining to see faraway objects can produce headaches and eyestrain (aching in the eyes). If you have any problems with your vision, see an ophthalmologist (eye MD) for a thorough eye examination (see previous pages).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Nearsightedness]\nIn nearsightedness, the cornea and lens focus the light rays from distant objects in front of the retina, producing a blurred image. Nearby objects are usually seen clearly.\n\n![Diagram of the human eye showing the Cornea, Lens, Retina, Optic nerve, and Focal point. Light rays entering the eye are shown converging towards the focal point.]()![](_page_1904_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of nearsightedness is based on the symptoms, a family health history, an eye examination, and the results of vision tests.\n\nTo correct nearsightedness a doctor will prescribe glasses or contact lenses that move the focal point for distant objects backward onto the retina to bring them into clear focus. Although nearsightedness is not likely to worsen after age 30, you should continue seeing your ophthalmologist for regular eye examinations.\n\nDoctors may recommend a surgical procedure called LASIK (see below) to correct nearsightedness in people who cannot or do not want to wear glasses or contact lenses.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment* > LASIK]\nLASIK (which stands for laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis) is a surgical procedure that uses a laser (a highly concentrated beam of light) to reshape the cornea (the clear, protective covering at the front of the eye) to improve the focusing power of the eye. LASIK surgery is used to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism.\n\nLASIK can also be performed to produce monovision, in which one eye is corrected for far vision clarity and the other eye is left nearsighted or corrected for reading (near) vision clarity. The procedure is not recommended for children under age 18 because their eyes are still developing. It is also not recommended for people whose eyewear has a very weak correction or a very powerful correction or for people who have certain eye diseases, such as dry eye (see page 1037), or very large pupils. People with some disorders (such as autoimmune diseases) and people who take medications that might interfere with healing are not good candidates for LASIK. Not all people who have the surgery achieve 20/20 vision without glasses or contact lenses. If you use reading glasses, you may still need to use them after surgery.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Contact Lenses]\nContact lenses are thin, transparent, plastic disks that fit closely over the cornea (the clear, protective covering at the front of the eye) to help correct focusing disorders, including nearsightedness (see previous page), farsightedness (see next page), or astigmatism (see page 1033).\n\nThe three main types of contact lenses are hard lenses, gas-permeable hard lenses, and soft lenses. Hard lenses are made of tough plastic and are inexpensive and durable, but many people find them uncomfortable and difficult to wear. Gas-permeable hard lenses are more comfortable than hard lenses but are less durable and more expensive.

In corneal refractive therapy, a series of rigid, gas-permeable contact lenses is used to gradually reshape (flatten) the cornea (the clear, protective covering at the front of the eye), improving vision. Each lens in the series is worn overnight every night for a period of 2 to 8 weeks, until optimal vision is attained. However, because corneal refractive therapy does not produce permanent results, retainer contact lenses must be worn for several hours every few days (or more often) to maintain the new shape of the cornea. If retainer lenses are not used, the cornea will gradually return to its original shape. Poorly fitting lenses can cause eye discomfort and distorted vision.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Farsightedness]\nIn farsightedness (also called hyperopia), either the eyeball is too short from front to back or there is a weakness in the focusing ability of the cornea and lens. As a result, images of nearby objects can be focused behind the retina and are blurred. Images of distant objects are focused on the retina and are usually seen clearly. Farsightedness is usually congenital (present from birth) and tends to run in families.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nThe main symptom of farsightedness is blurred vision or eyestrain (aching in the eyes) when viewing nearby objects. However, in younger people, mild farsightedness often produces no noticeable symptoms. In older people, constant straining to focus on nearby objects can produce headaches and eyestrain. If you have any problems with your vision, see an ophthalmologist (eye MD) for a thorough eye examination (see page 1028).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Farsightedness]\nIn farsightedness, the cornea and lens focus the light rays from nearby objects behind the retina, producing a blurred image. Distant objects are usually seen clearly.\n\n![Diagram of the human eye showing the Cornea, Lens, Retina, Optic nerve, and the path of Light rays entering the eye. A dashed line indicates the focal point.]()![](_page_1908_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of farsightedness is based on the symptoms, a family health history, an eye examination, and the results of vision tests.\n\nIn younger people, mild farsightedness is often overcome by a natural process called accommodation, in which the ciliary body muscles (muscles surrounding the lens that help to control the shape of the lens) contract to thicken the lens and make it more convex. This brings the focal point for nearby objects forward onto the retina and produces a sharp, clear image. Farsighted people whose eyes can accommodate well usually do not need treatment.\n\nTo correct farsightedness, a doctor will prescribe glasses or contact lenses to boost the focusing power of the cornea and lens and move the focal point forward onto the retina to enable you to see more clearly. As you get older, usually beginning after age 40, the ciliary body muscles in the eye may gradually weaken. For this reason, you will probably need stronger glasses every few years. In some cases, ophthalmologists may recommend LASIK (see page 1030) to correct farsightedness.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Presbyopia]\nAt rest, the lens in the normal eye is focused for distance vision. To focus on closer objects, the ciliary body muscles in the eye contract to thicken the lens and make it more convex (curved outward), a natural process called accommodation. With age, the lens of the eye hardens, gradually reducing its ability to accommodate (focus on nearby objects). This condition, called presbyopia, usually develops when a person is in his or her mid-40s, and gradually worsens as he or she gets older.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nIn presbyopia, a person can focus on nearby objects only by holding them at a distance. For example, to read, the person may need to hold a book or newspaper at arm's length from his or her eyes. If you find that close objects are slightly blurred unless you hold them away from you, see an ophthalmologist (eye MD) for a thorough eye examination (see page 1028).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of presbyopia is based on the symptoms, an eye examination, and the results of vision tests.\n\nTo correct presbyopia, your doctor will prescribe glasses to compensate for the inability of the lens to focus, which will enable you to see nearby objects clearly. You will need slightly stronger glasses every few years as you get older, until about age 65, to compensate for your decreasing focusing ability. After age 65, the lenses of the eyes stop changing.\n\nIf you are already wearing glasses to correct a focusing disorder, you can avoid the need for two pairs of glasses by getting bifocals.

Gradually, a white head of pus appears on the swelling. Several styes may develop at the same time if the bacteria that are causing the infection spread to other follicles. A stye usually bursts and drains within a few days after it forms, relieving the pain. The swelling usually subsides after about a week.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > ***Treatment***]\nTo help a stye drain earlier, apply frequent warm, moist compresses as soon as it appears, to help draw the pus to a head. Do not squeeze the stye—allow it to open and release the pus on its own. Afterward, wash the eyelid carefully with mild soap or baby shampoo, using a clean, soft washcloth to remove all of the pus. Be careful not to spread the infection.\n\nIf a stye does not clear up in a week or so, if the swelling, redness, or tenderness spreads, or if a stye recurs, see your doctor. He or she will examine you, perform tests to determine what type of bacterium is causing the infection, and prescribe an antibiotic to treat the infection.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > ***Chalazion***]\nA chalazion is a painless swelling on the edge of the eyelid (see page 128) that results from inflammation of one of the meibomian glands, which lubricate the edge of the eyelid.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Treatment*]\nChalazions may be small or may grow large enough to cause blurred vision. Although small chalazions usually go away on their own within a month or two, you can speed the process by applying frequent warm, moist compresses to the affected area. For larger chalazions or chalazions that have become infected, a doctor may prescribe antibiotics, corticosteroid eyedrops, or surgery. To remove a chalazion, the doctor administers a local anesthetic, makes a small incision in the eyelid, and scrapes out the contents of the chalazion.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Treatment* > **Papilloma**]\nA papilloma is a slow-growing, benign (noncancerous) skin growth that can develop anywhere on the eyelid.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Treatment*]\nThe color of a papilloma can range from pink to skin-toned. Although a small, inconspicuous papilloma does not need treatment, a doctor may recommend surgery to remove a large, unsightly papilloma. Surgery is usually performed using local anesthesia in a doctor's office or in an outpatient facility.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Treatment* > **Xanthelasma**]\nIn xanthelasma, yellow patches of fatty material (called xanthomas) accumulate beneath the skin of the eyelids (see page 128), especially near the nose. Xanthelasma usually occurs in older people and is often associated with elevated levels of cholesterol (a fatlike substance in the blood) and triglycerides (the main type of fat in the blood).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nUnsightly patches of xanthelasma can be removed surgically. However, they frequently recur, especially if a person's triglyceride and cholesterol levels remain high.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > **Entropion**]\nIn entropion, the edge of the eyelid—usually the lower lid—turns inward toward the eye (see page 128), causing the eyelid and eyelashes to rub against the surface of the eyeball. This continuous rubbing causes the eye to become inflamed and can damage the conjunctiva (the transparent membrane that covers the white of the eye and lines the eyelids) and cornea (the clear, protective covering at the front of the eye).\n\nEntropion usually affects older people. As people age, the fibrous tissue on the lower eyelid loosens, allowing the muscle in the edge of the eyelid to contract abnormally and pull the edge of the eyelid in toward the eye. In some cases, an injury causes scarring on the inner surface of the eyelid, which can pull the edge of the eyelid in.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of entropion include pain and redness in the eye, excessive tearing, and discharge and crusting of mucus. If not treated, entropion can lead to conjunctivitis (see page 1038), corneal ulcers (see page 1037), and vision problems.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of entropion is based on the symptoms and an examination of the affected eyelid. If the lower eyelid is turned inward, the doctor may recommend turning the eyelid outward to its normal position and holding it there for a few days by attaching one end of a piece of adhesive tape to the eyelid (below the eyelashes) and the other end to the cheek. In some cases, this corrects the condition. The doctor may prescribe eyedrops or ointments to help relieve the pain and inflammation. If entropion persists, an ophthalmologist may recommend surgery to turn the eyelid outward and prevent it from rubbing on the surface of the eyeball.

The eye may feel irritated and gritty. Other possible symptoms include a dry mouth and joint pain.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of dry eye is based on the symptoms and an examination of the eye. To relieve discomfort, the doctor will probably prescribe eyedrops called artificial tears, which you may need to use for the rest of your life. In severe cases of dry eye, doctors may prescribe lubricating ointments or recommend a procedure to block the ducts that drain tears from the eye.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Corneal Ulcer**]\nA corneal ulcer is an open sore or break in the surface of the cornea (the clear, protective covering at the front of the eye). In most cases, a corneal ulcer begins as a scratch or other injury to the cornea that becomes infected by a bacterium, virus, or fungus. An infection can also be spread from another part of the body, such as when a person with a cold sore (which is caused by the herpes simplex virus) touches his or her mouth and then touches his or her eyes. Conditions that interfere with normal lubrication of the eyes by tears—such as entropion (see page 1035), ectropion (see page 1035), or dry eye (see above)—or using extended-wear contact lenses can increase the risk of corneal ulcers. People whose eyes are exposed to a spray of particles, such as wood or metal shavings, are also at increased risk.\n\nIf a corneal ulcer is not treated promptly, a scar can form on the cornea and impair vision. An infected ulcer may perforate the cornea and allow the infection to enter the eyeball, causing blindness.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Corneal ulcer]\nA corneal ulcer is an open sore or break in the surface of the cornea caused by an infection.

The ulcer's effect on vision depends on its size and location. If a corneal ulcer is caused by a bacterial infection, the ulcer may be visible as a whitish patch on the cornea. An ulcer produced by a herpes simplex virus infection (dendritic ulcer) is usually not visible to the naked eye.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosis and Treatment]\nA corneal ulcer is diagnosed by the symptoms and an examination of the eye. If the doctor suspects that a dendritic ulcer may be present on the cornea, he or she may place special fluorescent eyedrops in the eye that stain and reveal the ulcer to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nTo treat a corneal ulcer caused by a bacterial infection, doctors prescribe antibiotics, given as drops, ointment, tablets, or injections. For a corneal ulcer caused by a herpes simplex virus infection, doctors prescribe antiviral medication in eyedrops or in an ointment. Corneal ulcers caused by fungi are treated with eyedrops that contain antifungal medication.\n\nIf scarring from corneal ulcers severely impairs a person's vision, a doctor may recommend a cornea transplant (see below), a surgical procedure in which the damaged cornea is removed and replaced with a healthy cornea from a donor. If an ulcer has perforated the cornea, immediate surgery is required to seal the hole and prevent the infection from entering the eyeball.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Cornea Transplants]\nA cornea transplant is a surgical procedure that is used to restore vision when the cornea has been permanently damaged as a result of injury, infection, disease, or degeneration. A surgeon performs a cornea transplant in a hospital operating room using either local or general anesthesia. The procedure lasts about 1 to 2 hours and does not usually require an overnight stay in the hospital.\n\nTo perform the transplant, a surgeon uses a special surgical instrument (called a trephine) that works like a cookie cutter to remove the central portion of the damaged cornea. He or she then places a clear cornea supplied by an organ donor into the opening in the damaged cornea and sews it into place with very fine thread. The stitches remain in the cornea for up to a year or longer, until the cornea has healed completely.

If the inflammation occurs at the back of the eye, vision may be impaired.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of scleritis is based on the symptoms and an examination of the eye. Mild or moderate cases of scleritis are usually treated with anti-inflammatory medications such as corticosteroids, taken in eyedrops or in tablets. In severe cases, doctors may prescribe immune-suppressing drugs, which dampen the abnormal immune response and relieve inflammation. If the sclera is perforated, surgery is necessary to repair the damage.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **uveitis**]\nUveitis is inflammation of the uvea, which consists of the iris (the colored part of the eye), the ciliary body (the ring of muscles that focus the lens), and the choroid (the layer of blood vessels beneath the retina). The condition is called iritis when the inflammation is confined to the iris, cyclitis when it is confined to the ciliary body, and choroiditis (see page 1052) when it is confined to the choroid.\n\nUveitis is rare, and the cause is usually unknown. However, in some cases, the disorder may result from an autoimmune disorder (in which the immune system mistakenly attacks body tissues) or from infection with a virus such as the herpes simplex virus or herpes zoster virus. Uveitis can occur at any age, but it occurs most frequently in young adults. The disorder can affect one or both eyes.\n\nBecause untreated uveitis can lead to serious complications—such as cataracts (see next page); glaucoma (see page 1042); the growth of new, abnormally fragile blood\n\nvessels on the retina; or blindness—early detection and treatment are crucial.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nThe symptoms of uveitis include eye discomfort, pain, or redness; increased sensitivity to light; and blurred vision. The symptoms may be mild or severe. A diagnosis of uveitis is based on the symptoms and an eye examination.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTo treat uveitis, a doctor usually prescribes a corticosteroid drug in the form of eyedrops, an ointment, an injection, or a pill to relieve the pain and inflammation. Doctors may also prescribe eyedrops that dilate the pupil to prevent the back of the inflamed iris from sticking to the front of the lens, which could block the flow of fluid out of the eyeball, increasing pressure inside the eyeball. Even with effective treatment, the condition may recur.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Inner Eye]\nThe lens is a transparent, elastic structure inside the eye that enables the eye to focus. It is directly behind the iris (the colored part of the eye) and is attached to a circular muscular ring called the ciliary body. When you look at an object, the ciliary body contracts, changing the shape of the lens and increasing the focusing power of the eye.\n\nThe membrane that lines the inside of the back of the eye is called the retina. The retina is covered with nerve cells—called rods and cones—that are specially adapted to detecting light. The cones, which detect fine detail and color, are located more densely in the macula, an area in the center of the retina at the very back of the inside of the eyeball. For this reason, you have to look straight at an object to see it clearly. The rods, which are sensitive to the intensity of the light entering the eye, are located throughout the retina.\n\nWhen light passes through the cornea, pupil, and lens at the front of the eye, the light rays focus on the retina, which transforms them into nerve impulses. The impulses then pass along the optic nerve at the back of the eye\n\nto the areas of the brain that control vision, where they are perceived as images.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Cataracts]\nA cataract is clouding of the lens of the eye (see page 127). As protein fibers in the lens clump together, the clouding worsens and prevents some light rays from passing through the lens and reaching the retina, the light-sensitive membrane that lines the inside of the back of the eye. Because cataracts usually develop very slowly, early vision changes may not be noticeable. However, as the cataract grows denser, the person's vision gradually worsens. Cataracts usually do not cause pain.\n\nThere are several different types of cataracts. Congenital cataracts are present from birth, or cataracts may develop during childhood. In adults, the most common type of cataract is an age-related cataract, which can begin to develop when a person is in his or her 40s or 50s. Most cataracts are age-related. Another type of cataract is a secondary cataract, which usually develops in people with a chronic disease, especially diabetes (see page 889). A traumatic cataract is a cataract that develops as a result of an eye injury.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Q & A > Cataracts]\n**Q.** *My grandmoth", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "corticosteroids", "relation": "treats", "tail": "scleritis"}, {"head": "immune-suppressing drugs", "relation": "prescribes for", "tail": "severe cases of scleritis"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctors", "relation": "prescribe", "tail": "[Event: immune-suppressing drugs]"}, {"head": "doctors", "relation": "examine", "tail": "[Event: eye examination]"}, {"head": "patients", "relation": "undergo", "tail": "[Event: surgery]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: inflammation]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment with corticosteroids]"}, {"head": "[Event: perforation of the sclera]", "relation": "requires", "tail": "[Event: surgery]"}]}, "status": "success"}

A leading cause of blindness in the United States, glaucoma is about three to four times more likely to occur in blacks than in whites, and the disease causes blindness in blacks about six times as often.\n\nThe most common type of glaucoma, called chronic open-angle glaucoma, usually develops gradually over a number of years. A clear, watery liquid called aqueous fluid flows in and out of a small space at the front of each eye (the anterior chamber) to bathe and nourish nearby tissues and remove wastes. In chronic open-angle glaucoma, the drainage angle (the channel through which aqueous fluid drains from the eyeball) malfunctions and the fluid does not drain properly, causing the normal pressure inside the eye to slowly rise. If not controlled, this abnormally high pressure can permanently damage the optic nerve and other parts of the eye, causing vision loss and, eventually, blindness.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Cataract Surgery]\nSurgery to remove a cataract and implant a replacement lens is performed frequently in the United States, with a very high success rate—good vision is\n\nrestored in about 98 percent of people who have the procedure. Cataract surgery usually takes an hour or less, and most people are able to go home the same day. If you have cataracts in both eyes, you will have two separate procedures performed on different days.\n\nThe two major types of surgery to remove a cataract are phacoemulsification (also called phaco or small-incision cataract surgery) and extracapsular surgery. Your doctor will explain the advantages and disadvantages of each type of surgery so you can make an informed decision and choose the procedure that is best for you. Before surgery, your ophthalmologist will perform tests to measure the curve of the cornea and the size and shape of your eye to determine the strength of the replacement lens.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Cataract Surgery > Preparing for Surgery]\nThe doctor will ask you not to eat or drink after midnight on the day of surgery. To prepare your eye for surgery, you will be given eyedrops to dilate the pupil, and the area around your eye will be cleansed. If you choose to stay awake during surgery, you will be given a local anesthetic to numb your eye.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Cataract Surgery > Surgery]\nIn phacoemulsification, the surgeon looks at the eye through a special surgical microscope and makes a very small incision (about 1/8 inch long) on the side of the cornea. He or she then inserts a tiny probe through the incision and into the eye. The probe gives off ultrasound waves that break up the cataract, which is then sucked out of the eye through a tiny tube. After the replacement lens has been implanted, the incision may or may not be closed with stitches. Most cataracts are removed using phacoemulsification.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Cataract Surgery > Phacoemulsification]\nIn phacoemulsification, the surgeon makes a small incision in the cornea and inserts a tiny probe into the eye. The probe gives off ultrasound waves that break up the cataract, which is removed from the eye through a tiny suction tube. In most cases, the surgeon then inserts a replacement lens in the eye. The incision heals on its own and may not need stitches.\n\nDiagram illustrating the steps of cataract surgery.\n\n**Breaking up a cataract:** Shows the Cornea, Site of incision, Probe, and Clouded lens to be removed.\n\n**Inserting an intraocular lens:** Shows the Cornea, Site of incision, Intraocular lens folded for insertion, and Intraocular lens unfolding into position after insertion.\n\n![](_page_1929_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nIn extracapsular surgery, the surgeon looks at the eye through a special surgical microscope and makes an incision about  $\\frac{1}{2}$  inch long on the side of the cornea, removes the hard center of the lens through the incision, and removes the rest of the lens through a tiny suction tube. After a replacement lens has been implanted, the surgeon closes the incision with a few tiny stitches.\n\nIn both types of cataract surgery, the cloudy lens is usually replaced with a transparent, artificial intraocular lens. Phacoemulsification uses a folded lens that unfolds on its own after insertion. You cannot see or feel an intraocular lens, and it becomes a permanent part of the eye. In some cases, an intraocular lens cannot be used and a contact lens may be prescribed after surgery. In other cases, powerful eyeglasses may be prescribed.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Cataract Surgery > Recovery]\nAfter surgery, a patch may be placed over your eye and your eye will be monitored carefully for signs of potential complications such as pain or bleeding.

The doctor then dilates (widens) your pupils with eyedrops and looks inside your eyes through an ophthalmoscope (a viewing instrument that projects a bright light onto the back of the eye) to evaluate the retina and the optic nerve. He or she also looks through the cornea of each eye to examine the structure and condition of the drainage angle.\n\nThe doctor may perform a test called gonioscopy, in which he or she anesthetizes the eyes with eyedrops and places a special contact lens called a gonioscope on the cornea to closely examine the drainage angle of each eye for any changes or signs of blockage.

I had heard of glaucoma before, and I seemed to recall that one of my grandparents had it, but I thought it happened just to older people.\n\nLucky for me, the doctor said that the glaucoma was at an early stage and that it could be treated by keeping the pressure inside the eye at a normal level. She prescribed some eyedrops for me to use every day, which, she explained, would lower the pressure in my eyes. She told me about the side effects of the medication—one of which is asthmalike symptoms. I put the eyedrops in my eyes religiously twice a day for about 2 months. Then I started having trouble breathing. I told the eye doctor about the breathing and she told me to stop taking the drops and to see my family doctor to be sure it was the medication and not a serious condition that was the cause of my breathing problems.\n\nThe eye doctor gave me different types of eyedrops to try that wouldn't affect my breathing, but they either did not control my glaucoma or they\n\nirritated my eyes. The eye doctor then suggested that I have laser surgery to control the pressure in my eyes. She explained that the procedure is painless and can be performed right in her office.

In some people, the disease can occur as early as middle age but usually develops after age 60. People with a family history of macular degeneration are more likely to develop the disease. Risk factors include smoking, long-term exposure to sunlight, nearsightedness, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, and a high cholesterol level. Women are at greater risk than men (loss of the female hormone estrogen at menopause may play a role). Whites are at greater risk than people of other races (people with light-colored eyes may be more susceptible to damage to the macula from prolonged exposure to sunlight or other forms of ultraviolet light).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nThe most common early symptom of dry macular degeneration is blurred vision. Distortion or a small blind spot may appear in the center of your field of vision, and you may be gradually less able to distinguish fine details on, for example, faces or printed pages. Over time, the blind spot may become larger and darker. The disease may affect only one eye at first but, in most cases, the other eye is affected eventually.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms > Location of the macula]\nThe macula is the part of the retina that provides sharp focus at the center of the visual field. The macula enables you to see fine details, which are essential for activities such as reading and driving and for recognizing colors and faces.\n\n![Diagram of the human eye showing the location of the macula. Key structures labeled include the Cornea, Iris, Lens, Retina, Retinal blood vessels, and Optic nerve. The macula is located centrally on the Retina.]()![](_page_1937_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\nIn wet macular degeneration, fluid from the leaking blood vessels collects beneath the macula and lifts it, causing shapes to appear distorted and objects in straight lines (such as sentences on a page) to look crooked or wavy. Colors may appear faded. A blind spot in the center of the field of vision may develop quickly.\n\nNeither dry nor wet age-related macular degeneration affects peripheral (side) vision or causes pain. A person may have difficulty seeing in bright light and may have problems adjusting from darkness to light. In people with dry macular degeneration, the disease progresses so slowly that they are not aware of any changes in their vision. In people with wet macular degeneration, the disease progresses rapidly and leads to the loss of sharp central vision in one or both eyes.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose macular degeneration, an ophthalmologist (eye MD) will take a health history and ask you questions about your lifestyle—such as your diet and exercise habits and whether you smoke—to help determine your risk of developing the disease. He or she will evaluate your central and peripheral vision, measure how well you can see at various distances, and may assess your ability to see color. The doctor will perform tests to determine how your eyes function, both separately and together. He or she will dilate (widen) your pupils with eyedrops and look inside your eyes with an ophthalmoscope (a viewing instrument that projects a bright light onto the back of the eye) to examine the retina. He or she also may take a series of photographs of the retina to establish a baseline that will allow him or her to track the progression of the disease.\n\nA common early sign of dry macular degeneration is the appearance of tiny yellow deposits in the retina called drusen, which the ophthalmologist can easily see during an eye examination. The doctor may ask you to look at a pattern called an Amsler grid; if the lines of the grid look wavy or distorted, or if some sections of the grid appear blank, you may have macular degeneration. The ophthalmologist may perform tests called fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography. In these procedures, a dye is injected into a vein in your arm, and a rapid series of photographs is taken as the dye moves through the blood vessels in the retina. This allows the doctor to evaluate the condition of the blood vessels in the choroid and in the retina.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThere is no cure for either form of age-related macular degeneration. Although there is currently no proven treatment for dry macular degeneration, this does not mean that you will lose your sight, because the disease progresses very slowly. The doctor may prescribe a supplement containing antioxidants and zinc and recommend changes in your diet that may help protect your eyes from additional damage and help slow the progression of the disease. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables, which are rich in antioxidants. Two antioxidants, lutein and zeaxanthin (which make up the pigment in the macula), are naturally protective of the macula.\n\nWearing sunglasses that block ultraviolet rays and sun visors ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "smoking", "relation": "risk factor", "tail": "macular degeneration"}, {"head": "long-term exposure to sunlight", "relation": "risk factor", "tail": "macular degeneration"}, {"head": "nearsightedness", "relation": "risk factor", "tail": "macular degeneration"}, {"head": "coronary artery disease", "relation": "risk factor", "tail": "macular degeneration"}, {"head": "high blood pressure", "relation": "risk factor", "tail": "macular degeneration"}, {"head": "high cholesterol level", "relation": "risk factor", "tail": "macular degeneration"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "people with a family history of macular degeneration", "relation": "are more likely to develop the disease", "tail": "[Event: develop the disease]"}, {"head": "women", "relation": "are at greater risk than men", "tail": "[Event: loss of the female hormone estrogen at menopause]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: prolonged exposure to sunlight or other factors]", "relation": "may play a role in", "tail": "[Event: damage to the macula]"}, {"head": "[Event: loss of the female hormone estrogen at menopause]", "relation": "may play a role in", "tail": "[Event: greater risk than men]"}]}, "status": "success"}

The ophthalmologist dilates your pupils with eyedrops and then examines your retinas while looking through an ophthalmoscope (a viewing instrument that projects a bright light onto the back of the eye). He or she looks for signs of diabetic retinopathy, such as changes in blood vessels, leaking blood vessels, abnormal new blood vessel growth on the retina, or damaged nerve tissue.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTo prevent diabetic retinopathy or to slow its progression, your doctor will recommend controlling the level of glucose in your blood with diet, exercise, and medication (insulin, in some cases). He or she will stress the importance of keeping your blood pressure within the normal range (see page 576).\n\nIn some cases, an ophthalmologist may recommend laser surgery, in which a surgeon directs a highly concentrated beam of light onto the retina either to seal leaking blood vessels or to shrink abnormal blood vessels. The procedure is done using a local anesthetic and can be performed in the doctor's office or in an outpatient facility; you return home the same day. Laser surgery can reduce the risk of severe vision loss from diabetic retinopathy, but it may not restore vision that has already been lost. After surgery you may lose some peripheral (side) vision, and your color and night vision may also be affected. In some cases, the surgery must be repeated.\n\nFor advanced cases of diabetic retinopathy in which leaking blood has filled the vitreous fluid, an ophthalmologist may recommend a type of microsurgery (delicate surgery performed under a microscope) called vitrectomy instead of laser surgery. In vitrectomy, the blood-filled vitreous fluid is removed and replaced with a clear saline (saltwater) solution. Other than improved vision, you will not notice any difference between the saline solution and the vitreous fluid. Vitrectomy may take several hours to complete and is performed in a hospital using either local or general anesthesia. You may need to stay in the hospital overnight. Recovery time varies depending on the extent of the problem.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > **Vitrectomy**]\nIf leaking blood has filled the vitreous fluid, an ophthalmologist may recommend a surgical procedure called vitrectomy, in which the vitreous fluid is removed and\n\nreplaced with a clear saline (saltwater) solution.

If a branch of the artery is blocked, part of the visual field in the affected eye—usually the upper half or the lower half—is blacked out. If you suddenly lose all or part of your vision in one eye, see an ophthalmologist immediately or go directly to the nearest hospital emergency department.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of retinal artery occlusion is based on the symptoms and an examination of the affected eye. In rare cases, it may be possible to restore some of the lost vision by causing the clot or embolus to move farther along the blood vessel to a position where less of the retina is affected. This may be done by reducing pressure inside the eye, either with medication or by draining excess fluid, within a few hours of the appearance of symptoms.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment* > Retinal Vein Occlusion]\nThe central retinal vein carries oxygen-depleted blood away from the retina (the light-sensitive membrane lining the back of the eye). In rare cases, usually in middle-aged or older people, the central retinal vein or one of its branches becomes blocked by a thrombus (blood clot), which causes blood to leak from the blocked vessel, blurring vision.\n\nRetinal vein occlusion may occur in chronic glaucoma (see page 1042) or with high blood pressure (see page 574). In rare cases, the disorder results from blood diseases in which the blood is thicker than normal and tends to clot more easily. Effective treatment of an underlying disease or condition, such as high blood pressure, can help prevent retinal vein occlusion.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nIf the central retinal vein becomes blocked, it usually causes sudden blurring of vision in the affected eye. When retinal artery occlusion (see previous page) occurs along with retinal vein occlusion, any blurring of vision is usually worse and more likely to be permanent. When retinal vein occlusion occurs alone, vision may improve as the clot is reabsorbed. However, permanent damage to the vein or retina frequently occurs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of retinal vein occlusion is based on the symptoms and an examination of the affected eye. Sometimes retinal vein occlusion is detected by chance when an ophthalmologist examines the inside of the eyeball with an ophthalmoscope (a viewing instrument that projects a bright light onto the back of the eye) during a routine eye examination. In some cases, an ophthalmologist may recommend laser surgery (which uses a highly concentrated beam of light) to help close leaking blood vessels.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Choroiditis**]\nChoroiditis is inflammation of the choroid, the layer of blood vessels beneath the retina (the light-sensitive membrane lining the back of the eye) that supplies the eye with oxygen and nutrients. In some cases, the retina and the vitreous fluid (the substance that makes up the mass of the inside of the eyeball) also become inflamed. Although the exact cause of the disorder usually cannot be identified, sometimes an infectious agent such as the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (see page 663) is the cause. In some cases, an abnormal immune response mistakenly produces antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) that attack the choroid and sometimes other parts of the eye.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nThe symptoms of choroiditis include redness, discomfort, and blurred vision in the affected eye.\n\nA diagnosis of choroiditis is based on the symptoms and an eye examination. An ophthalmologist will probably order blood tests to check for an infection, and possibly an ultrasound (see page 111) if he or she cannot see far enough into the eyeball with an\n\nophthalmoscope (a viewing instrument that projects a bright light onto the back of the eye).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis* > *Treatment*]\nTo treat choroiditis, a doctor may prescribe corticosteroid drugs to relieve inflammation and pain and eliminate the blurred vision. If choroiditis is caused by an infection, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis* > **Optic Neuritis**]\nOptic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve, which disrupts the flow of signals from the retina to the brain and impairs vision. The condition usually develops between ages 20 and 40. In rare cases, optic neuritis results from an infection in the tissues that surround the optic nerve. Optic neuritis can occur in people who have multiple sclerosis (see page 696), which affects the nervous system.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis* > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptom of optic neuritis is gradual or sudden blurring of vision in one eye. In severe cases, the blurring may progress to temporary blindness within a few days.

The effects of a tumor on a person's vision can vary, depending on where in the eye the tumor is located, how fast the tumor is growing, and whether one or both eyes are affected. If a tumor grows inside the eye, it can cause blurred vision.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nA secondary tumor is treated separately from a primary tumor. A doctor may prescribe chemotherapy (see page 23) or radiation therapy (see page 23) to block the growth of or destroy a secondary tumor in the eye. Any loss of vision that occurs before treatment may be permanent.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Color Vision Deficiency**]\nColor vision deficiency (also called color blindness) is a vision disorder in which a person sees colors differently than other people see them or has difficulty distinguishing shades of some colors. The disorder occurs when malfunctioning receptor cells for color in the retina (the light-sensitive membrane lining the back of the eye) transmit incorrect information about color to the brain.\n\nColor vision deficiency is a common disorder that is usually inherited. Although women can carry the gene for the common form of color vision deficiency and pass it on to their children, men are more often affected by the disorder; about 8 percent of men in the United States have color vision deficiency. Difficulty distinguishing colors can develop when normal age-related changes in the lens of the eye cause it to darken, impairing a person's ability to see differences between some colors. The disorder can also result from a disease or injury that damages the eye or the optic nerve, or from degeneration of the retina or the optic nerve.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of color vision deficiency can range from difficulty seeing the difference between shades of the same color to an inability to see all colors. Although the severity of color vision deficiency varies from one person to another, most people who have the\n\ndisorder have a mild deficiency and have difficulty distinguishing shades of red and green.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of color vision deficiency is based on the symptoms, your family health history, and the results of color vision tests. Although there is no cure for color vision deficiency, your ophthalmologist can recommend steps you can take to deal with the problem, such as learning to recognize colors by brightness or location. For example, to read traffic signals, you remember that the red light is on the top and the green light is on the bottom. Some people who have difficulty distinguishing shades of red and green may benefit from using tinted prescription glasses.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > Other Eye Disorders]\nThe two bony sockets in the skull that contain the eyeballs are called the orbits. The eyeballs are supported in the orbits by soft tissue. Sometimes an underlying disease or condition, such as Graves' disease or a tumor behind the eyeball, causes one or both eyeballs to bulge forward in the orbits. In some cases, an infection that has spread to the soft tissue of the orbit from the sinuses or from a nearby boil causes inflammation that makes the eyeballs bulge forward. Muscles attached to the outside of each eyeball and to the inside back portion of each orbit give the eyes movement. If these muscles are not balanced, or if there is a defect in the nerves that control them, the eyes can become misaligned.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > Exophthalmos]\nExophthalmos is a condition in which one or both eyeballs bulge forward, exposing an abnormally large part of the front of the eye (see page 128). The most common cause of the condition is Graves' disease (see page 901), an autoimmune disorder that causes the thyroid gland to become overactive. Other possible causes of exophthalmos include a\n\ntumor behind the eyeball (see previous page) or inflammation of the tissue behind the eyeball (orbital cellulitis; see next page).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nIn exophthalmos, the eyes tend to feel dry. Eye movement may be restricted, which can cause double vision. In severe cases, the eye is pressed so far forward that the eyelids may not close completely and the front of the eye may become dry and feel gritty, causing pain and blurred vision.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA diagnosis of exophthalmos is based on the symptoms, a health history, a physical examination, and an examination of the eye, especially the orbit (the bony socket in which the eyeball sits). The doctor may order blood tests and recommend an ultrasound (see page 111), a CT scan (see page 112), or an MRI (see page 113) to help d", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "tumor", "relation": "can cause", "tail": "bulged eyes"}, {"head": "tumor", "relation": "can cause", "tail": "blurred vision"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "may prescribe", "tail": "[Event: chemotherapy]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "may prescribe", "tail": "[Event: radiation therapy]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

In addition to uncoordinated movement of the eyes, most adults who develop misaligned eyes experience double vision and sometimes problems with depth perception. They also may have symptoms of an underlying disorder that is causing the misalignment. Any child or adult who has misaligned eyes should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose misaligned eyes in a child, an ophthalmologist will perform an eye examination and may order tests to determine the cause. He or she will check for abnormalities in the eyes, in the movement of the eyes, and in the muscles that control eye movement.\n\nTo determine the underlying cause of misaligned eyes in an adult, an ophthalmologist asks about the person's symptoms and performs an eye examination. He or she may also order blood tests and a CT scan (see page 112) or MRI (see page 113). The ophthalmologist may recommend that you see your primary care doctor or a neurologist\n\n(a doctor who specializes in treating disorders of the nervous system) for further evaluation and treatment.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nEarly treatment of eye misalignment improves a child's chances for normal vision. Children whose eyes are misaligned may need to wear an eye patch over the good eye and eyeglasses to ensure use of the misaligned eye and to strengthen vision in it. Surgery to tighten or loosen some of the muscles that control eye movement is frequently performed, especially in children under age 2. The procedure is usually performed on an outpatient basis, and the child stays in the hospital for a few hours after surgery. The child may need to wear an eye patch and glasses after surgery.\n\nIf a child's eyes become misaligned after age 2, an ophthalmologist usually prescribes glasses to correct the condition. The child may also need to wear a patch over his or her good eye for several hours each day to ensure use of the misaligned eye. In most of these children, the combination of a patch and glasses corrects the misalignment within a few years. In some children, surgery on the eye muscles may be needed to align the eyes.\n\nIn adults, successful treatment of an underlying disease or condition may eliminate the misalignment. Double vision may go away on its own within a few months. In some cases, an ophthalmologist may prescribe special glasses to correct the problem. In other cases, doctors may recommend surgery to tighten or loosen some of the eye muscles to coordinate eye movements.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Skin, Hair, and Nails]\nThe skin is the largest organ of the body. It contains millions of tiny nerve endings (called receptors) that respond to pressure and changes in temperature to provide you with information about your surroundings. Your skin also contains many tiny glands. Sebaceous glands produce an oily substance called sebum that helps keep the skin's surface supple and prevent it from drying and cracking. When you are hot or have a fever, sweat glands produce a watery liquid that evaporates on the skin to cool your body, and small blood vessels in your skin dilate (widen) to allow heat to escape. When you are cold, your skin conserves heat by constricting (narrowing) the blood vessels.\n\nHair and nails are extensions of the skin and are composed mostly of keratin (the main constituent of the outermost layer of the skin). There are thousands of hair follicles in the skin. Follicles are pits of actively dividing cells that continuously make hairs. Relatively larger, thicker hairs grow on the scalp and pubic area; smaller, finer hairs (some that can barely be seen) grow elsewhere on the body. Fingernails and toenails, like hair, are continuously produced by actively dividing cells under the fold of skin at the base and sides of each nail.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Skin, Hair, and Nails > Cross section of the skin]\nThe skin consists mainly of two layers—the epidermis (the thin, protective outer layer made up mostly of dead cells) and the dermis (the thicker layer containing blood vessels, nerves, oil glands, and hair follicles). The subcutaneous tissue is a layer of fat under the skin.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the layers of the skin and associated structures. The layers shown are Epidermis, Dermis, and Subcutaneous tissue.

They are composed of dense collections of the pigment-producing cells in the skin called melanocytes. Moles are very common, especially in some ethnic groups. In rare cases, they can become cancerous (malignant melanoma; see page 1069). Benign moles can be surgically removed for cosmetic reasons.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Freckles]\nFreckles are tiny flat patches of pigmented skin that appear on sun-exposed areas and multiply with repeated sun exposure. They most often develop in people who are fair and have red hair. People who have freckles need to be especially careful about exposing their skin to the sun because they are at increased risk of developing skin cancer from sun exposure. If you have freckles, try to avoid the sun and always wear a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Age spots]\nAge spots (see page 118), medically referred to as solar lentigos, are darkened areas of skin that result from long-term exposure to the sun. They usually develop in middle age or later on the skin areas most frequently exposed to the sun, such as the hands, face, and chest. They may be up to an inch in diameter. For people who consider age spots unattractive, doctors can remove them with laser surgery, cryosurgery (freezing with liquid nitrogen), or chemical peels, or by cutting them out. Surgery is performed as an outpatient procedure and usually requires only one session. Age spots usually return because they are related to previous sun exposure. To help prevent the spot from returning after treatment, wear a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Age spots > **Dermatosis papulosa nigra**]\nDermatosis papulosa nigra is a noncancerous condition resembling seborrheic keratoses (see page 1063). It is characterized by brown or black mole-like or wartlike spots on the face and neck and occurs almost exclusively in people with dark skin.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Age spots > **Acanthosis nigricans and pseudoacanthosis nigricans**]\nA thickening and darkening of skin folds around the neck or in the armpits or groin (called acanthosis nigricans) can be a symptom of cancer or a genetic disorder in people with dark skin. However, it usually is a noncancerous condition (called pseudoacanthosis nigricans) that is associated with obesity. Excessive sweating may occur in these areas, and the skin may itch.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Age spots > **Purpura and acquired angiomas**]\nPurpura are purplish or reddish brown spots on the skin caused by leaks in the small blood vessels in underlying tissues. The spots can range from the size of a pinpoint (called petechiae) to 2 inches across, and can be flat or slightly raised. Purpura are linked to a number of disorders, from allergies (see page 423) to thrombocytopenia (see page 620), but their cause is unknown. They may result from an inherited weakness in the walls of blood vessels.\n\nHarmless petechiae called cherry angiomas can appear on the trunk, upper arms, and thighs after age 30. They may bleed if injured. Cherry angiomas may result from loss of skin elasticity with age.\n\nDilated blood vessels known as spider angiomas, or spider veins, are most common on the face (especially around the nose), breasts, arms, and legs. Spider angiomas often occur in girls during puberty, in pregnant women, and in women who are taking oral contraceptives or hormone therapy, possibly because hormones such as estrogen weaken vein walls. Spider veins can also occur in people with liver disease and after sun exposure or injury to the skin.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Other pigmentation changes]\nSome diseases (such as Addison's disease; see page 899) and some medications (such as the acne medication isotretinoin or the antibiotic tetracycline) can cause the skin to darken. Other medications (such as birth-control pills) and some chemicals (such as perfumes) can intensify the effect of the sun on the skin and cause dark patches. Sometimes hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy or at menopause can cause changes in the skin, making patches of skin darker with sun exposure (a condition called chloasma). Cuts, abrasions, or acne sites that have healed can leave scars that stay discolored for a long time.\n\nAn excess amount of the bile pigment bilirubin can turn the skin yellow (jaundice; see pages 118 and 785), as can eating an excessive amount of foods that contain the orange pigment carotene (found in carrots, tomatoes, and some green vegetables). Too much iron can turn the skin bronze (hemochromatosis; see page 961).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Boils]\nA boil (see page 122) is an infection of a hair follicle (a tiny pit in the skin from which a hair grows) by bacteria, usually staphylococcus. Boils are common and can result from poor hygiene or low resistance to infection.

The virus produces small, waxy-looking growths on the skin. The infection is relatively common in children; in adults, it is usually transmitted sexually. Scratching can spread the virus from one area of the body to another.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nAt first, the growths are firm, solid, and flesh colored. Eventually, they become softer and pearly, usually with a depression in the center. In some cases, a white, cheesy or waxy substance drains from them. The growths can appear on the face, trunk, arms, or abdomen. When transmitted sexually, the growths usually appear on the genitals and upper thighs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA doctor can usually diagnose molluscum contagiosum by its appearance. A sample can be taken from one of the growths for examination under a microscope (biopsy) to detect the virus and confirm the diagnosis. If not treated, the rash can spread or lead to bacterial infections, especially in people who have a weakened immune system. Doctors usually destroy the growths with heat (electrocautery) using a high-frequency electric current or cold (cryosurgery) using chemicals such as liquid nitrogen to kill the virus inside the growth. The treatment can cause temporary irritation or blistering but does not leave a scar. Some growths may reappear 2 to 3 weeks after treatment and need to be treated again. For a person with a weakened immune system, a doctor may prescribe an antiviral medication to help fight the infection.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Corns and Calluses**]\nCorns and calluses are areas of skin that have thickened because of constant pressure and friction. Corns develop on the top or sides of the toes or between the toes. Calluses are larger areas of thickened skin that usually appear on the ball of the foot, on the heel, or over a bunion (see page 989), although they also can develop on the palms of the hands or on the tips of the fingers. Corns and calluses usually develop after wearing new or poorly fitting shoes. Wearing high heels can cause calluses from increased pressure on the ball of the foot. Calluses can develop on the hands in people who do\n\nheavy or infrequent manual work. Some people are susceptible to calluses and corns because they have less cushioning tissue between the bones and skin of their feet.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nThe tissue under the thickened skin of a corn or callus can be tender. You probably don't need to see a doctor unless it becomes very painful. However, if you have a corn or callus and have a disorder such as diabetes (see page 889), which decreases sensitivity in the feet, see a doctor right away; poor circulation to the area can cause a deep ulcer to develop in the callus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nYou can relieve pressure on a corn or callus on your foot by going barefoot every chance you get and by using over-the-counter protective pads. Pads that contain salicylic acid can help dissolve thickened skin. You can soften a callus on your feet or hands with a moisturizer. Gently rub away dead skin from the callus with a pumice stone or file, being careful not to press hard enough to inflame the sensitive tissue underneath. Wear comfortable shoes or protective gloves. The corn or callus should disappear within several weeks. If these measures don't work, your doctor may trim the corn or callus or use a strong chemical to dissolve it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Dermatitis**]\nDermatitis is inflammation of the skin that can result from an allergy but in many cases occurs for unknown reasons. Many types of dermatitis are also known as eczema (see page 120). There are several types of dermatitis or eczema.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Dermatitis** > **Atopic dermatitis**]\nAtopic dermatitis (also called atopic eczema) is a skin reaction associated with allergies. In atopic dermatitis, the skin is much more sensitive than usual to many substances. Environmental factors seem to trigger atopic dermatitis in people who are genetically susceptible. Children are at increased risk of developing atopic dermatitis if they have a family history of other atopic diseases, such as hay fever (see page 914) or asthma (see page 640). Adults with atopic dermatitis have a susceptibility to developing contact dermatitis (see below) or irritant dermatitis (see above right).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Dermatitis** > *Contact dermatitis*]\nContact dermatitis is a type of atopic dermatitis caused by a reaction to particular substances that have touched the skin. Some skin reactions related to contact dermatitis are relatively mild and do not occur in most people.

If you have a severe case of dermatitis or the self-help measures do not relieve your symptoms, see your doctor. He or she may refer you to an allergist or a dermatologist (a doctor who specializes in disorders of the skin), who may recommend skin and blood tests (see pages 912 and 913) to help determine the cause.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > **Self-Help for Dry Skin and Dermatitis**]\nSkin can become dry for a number of reasons, such as overwashing or exposure to chemicals. Skin drying and irritation can usually be prevented and treated with the following measures:\n\n- If possible, avoid contact with the substance that is causing your dermatitis.\n- Don't rub or scratch the affected areas. Fill plastic bags with water and freeze them, then apply the frozen bags to the affected areas to relieve the itching.\n- Ask your doctor to recommend an over-the-counter corticosteroid cream or ointment (to reduce inflammation and promote healing), a pain reliever, or an antihistamine (to reduce itching, swelling, and redness).\n- Don't wash too often. Use a mild, superfatted soap and apply it with your hands or a clean sponge (not a washcloth or loofah, which are rough on the skin). Don't use bubble baths or bath oils. Try to keep showers and tub baths short (no longer than 5 minutes), and use cool or lukewarm (not hot) water. Pat (don't rub) your skin dry.\n\n- Avoid saunas and steam baths.\n- Protect your skin by using a moisturizer, especially right after bathing or showering.\n- If dermatitis is on your hands, apply an unscented barrier hand cream frequently. Wear white cotton gloves under rubber gloves when working with a possible irritant.\n- Don't use perfumes, scented sprays, or talcum powder on your skin; these products can irritate the skin and worsen dermatitis.\n- Don't wear tight or poorly fitting clothes. Avoid rough, scratchy, or wool clothing, linens, blankets, rugs, or upholstery.\n- Use mild laundry detergents, and rinse clothes in clear water twice. Don't use fabric softeners.\n- Avoid excessive sweating. Dress lightly in cotton clothing.\n- Keep the temperature of your home cool and stable. Use a humidifier to keep the humidity level constant.\n- Avoid caffeine and alcohol; they can make itching feel worse.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIn addition to the self-help measures described on the previous page, your doctor may recommend a liquid cleanser (a substitute for both soap and water) that cleans and lubricates the skin. He or she may prescribe a more concentrated topical corticosteroid medication to speed up the healing process and an antihistamine to take before bedtime to reduce itching at night to help you sleep. Tacrolimus is a topical prescription ointment used to treat mild to moderate dermatitis that doesn't have the possible adverse side effects of topical corticosteroid preparations. Use only the creams or ointments that your doctor prescribes; using anything else may reduce the amount of natural oil produced by your skin. If you have a bacterial skin infection, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic.\n\nFor mild cases of infantile eczema, try to prevent your baby from becoming too hot. Don't overdress him or her. Dress your child in cotton clothes that are washed and rinsed well. Do not use moisturizers on your child's skin that haven't been prescribed or recommended by his or her pediatrician. Your child's doctor may prescribe an antihistamine to prevent the release of substances called histamines that produce allergic symptoms such as itching. Severe infantile eczema is often treated with topical corticosteroid medications to relieve the inflammation. Your child's doctor may\n\nrecommend eliminating foods from your child's diet that could be causing the eczema, such as cow's milk, wheat, orange juice, eggs, nuts, and chocolate.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Psoriasis]\nPsoriasis is a skin disorder in which new cells in the epidermis (the outermost layer of cells) are produced faster than old cells are shed, causing dead skin cells to accumulate in the affected areas. The cause of psoriasis is unknown, but it is probably a disorder of the immune system. An outbreak of psoriasis is often triggered by emotional stress, skin damage (such as that caused by severe sunburn), excessive consumption of alcohol, or taking some medications. A weakened immune system can trigger outbreaks. Psoriasis usually appears between ages 10 and 30, but it can occur at any age. The condition tends to run in families. Psoriasis can be disabling in the very young or very old if it is not treated. Occasionally a person who has psoriasis will have a form of arthritis (called psoriatic arthritis) that resembles rheumatoid arthritis (see page 918).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nThe symptoms of psoriasis include pink or red raised patches of thickened skin covered", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "dermatitis", "relation": "treats", "tail": "self-help measures"}, {"head": "self-help measures", "relation": "relieves", "tail": "symptoms"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "refer", "tail": "[Event: to an allergist or a dermatologist]"}, {"head": "allergist or dermatologist", "relation": "recommend", "tail": "[Event: skin and blood tests]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: exposure to chemicals]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: skin drying and irritation]"}, {"head": "[Event: overwashing]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: skin drying and irritation]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Sebaceous glands produce an oily substance called sebum that lubricates the skin. If your body produces too much sebum and it becomes trapped in follicles, blemishes called blackheads and whiteheads form. Bacteria that are normally present on the skin can invade the blocked follicle and multiply quickly, causing red, pus-filled lumps called pimples (see page 121). Acne is most common during puberty and adolescence because the level of male hormones rises in both boys and girls at this time, stimulating the sebaceous glands to increase sebum production. Acne usually clears up in the late teens or early 20s, although many people develop acne later in life.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nAcne blemishes are usually concentrated on the face, but may appear on the neck, back, chest, buttocks, and sometimes the upper arms and thighs. As some blemishes heal, others appear. Pimples may leave dark, purplish marks on the skin, which usually fade. Severely inflamed pimples may take weeks to clear and can leave scars.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > Acne blemishes]\nAn acne blemish can form when sebum and dead skin cells block the opening of a hair follicle. Blackheads (top) are blockages in which the collection of sebum turns dark because of oxidation and the presence of the skin pigment melanin. A blackhead can turn into a pimple (bottom) if the sebum that is unable to escape builds up along with bacteria and dead skin cells in the hair follicle, producing pus.\n\nDiagram illustrating two types of acne lesions:\n\n- **Blackhead:** Shows a blocked hair follicle (Hair follicle) containing a blockage made up of excess sebum and dead skin cells (Blockage).\n- **Pimple:** Shows a blocked hair follicle (Hair follicle) containing a pus-filled blockage (Pus-filled blockage).\n\nBoth lesions involve a Sebaceous (oil) gland.\n\n![](_page_1974_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > ***Treatment***]\nIf you have mild acne, keep your skin clean but don't scrub or pick it. Wash your skin with a mild, antibacterial soap twice a day. Try not to wash it more often unless it is very dirty or oily. Don't use moisturizers unless absolutely necessary, and then use only those recommended by your doctor—and only use them sparingly. Avoid wearing foundation makeup—if you feel you must, use a water-based makeup and always remove it completely. If you have oily skin, wash your hair with a dandruff or detergent shampoo, and don't use oily hair-care products.\n\nAcne treatments work in one or more of the following ways—by reducing the production of sebum, by killing the harmful bacteria on the skin, or by speeding up the rate at which skin cells are shed (by removing keratin, the main component of the outer layer of skin). These treatments have made severe acne and scarring less common. Ask your doctor to recommend an over-the-counter acne preparation that contains salicylic acid (which loosens and helps remove the keratin blocking the pores) or benzoyl peroxide (an antibacterial medication that induces skin peeling).\n\nYour doctor may refer you to a dermatologist (a doctor who specializes in disorders of the skin). The dermatologist may prescribe topical treatments such as a light chemical\n\npeel to loosen blackheads and prevent new blemishes, antibiotics (such as erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, or sulfonamide) to kill the bacteria, medications that decrease bacteria (such as azelaic acid), or nicotinamide (a B vitamin that makes antibiotics more effective). He or she may prescribe stronger acne medications called retinoids (such as retinoin, isotretinoin, adapalene, and tazarotene), which are derived from vitamin A. Retinoids have an antibacterial effect and loosen and remove keratin. Oral medications for acne include antibiotics (such as tetracycline, erythromycin, minocycline, and doxycycline), hormonal treatments (such as estrogen-containing birth-control pills or spironolactone), and the B vitamin nicotinamide.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Rosacea]\nRosacea is a skin disorder in which the tiny blood vessels in the face (usually in the cheeks, nose, and forehead; see page 123) enlarge over weeks or months. The cause is unknown, but the following factors may play a role—genetic predisposition, environmental factors, a disorder of the immune system or blood vessels, tiny mites that live in hair follicles, or Helicobacter pylori (a bacterium that causes infection in the gastrointestinal system). The condition can be triggered by hot or caffeine-containing foods or beverages, alcohol, sun exposure, stress, exercise, cold wind, or hot baths or showers. Women are more often affected, but the disorder is often more severe in men.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Rosacea > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nIn rosacea, the entire face may be red, or it may be red only in streaks or patches.

In rare cases, treatment requires intravenous antibiotics. If cellulitis is not treated, bacteria can enter the bloodstream and cause blood poisoning (see page 937), which can be life-threatening.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > Sunburn]\nSunburn is inflammation of the skin from overexposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun. The burned skin is red, hot, tender, and swollen. In severe cases, blisters may form and the skin may peel. You can get a sunburn more easily if you have light skin (although anyone can get sunburned). Having a disorder such as systemic lupus erythematosus (see page 920) or taking a medication such as tetracycline, doxycycline, or minocycline or a herbal supplement such as St John's wort can make the skin more sensitive to the sun's rays.\n\nYou can get sunburned at any time, even on an overcast or cold winter day. The sun's rays can reflect off surfaces such as snow, water, sand, or concrete. Sunburn is more likely to occur in places with intense sunlight, such as the southeastern and southwestern United States and places near the equator. People from northern latitudes who vacation in these areas are most susceptible to sunburn because they may not be aware of the sun's intensity at hours that are not usually dangerous at home.\n\nRepeatedly or regularly exposing your skin to the sun breaks down the elastic tissues in the skin, making it age prematurely and become wrinkled. In addition, excessive sun exposure can produce red, roughened patches of skin called actinic (or solar) keratoses (see next page), which are especially common in people with fair skin. Actinic keratoses can become cancerous if not treated.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > *Preventing Sunburn*]\nThe ultraviolet rays in sunlight destroy cells in the outer layer of skin and damage tiny blood vessels beneath, possibly leading to skin cancer, premature wrinkling, and spider veins (dilated blood vessels). To avoid skin damage from the sun:\n\n- Routinely apply a sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of 15 or higher to all uncovered areas of your body every time you go out during the day, especially before prolonged exposure to the sun. Reapply the sunscreen often throughout the day.\n- Wear clothing with a high SPF to block light. High-SPF clothing has a tight weave. For example, plain cotton has an SPF of 7, cotton and polyester have an SPF of 15, polyester and lycra have 35, and cotton denim has 1,700.\n- Wear a wide-brimmed hat that shades most of your face, neck, and shoulders. Baseball caps do not provide enough shade.\n- Walk or sit in the shade when you're outside.\n- Try to avoid the sun between 9 AM and 3 PM, when the ultraviolet rays are the strongest.\n- Don't try to get a tan, and don't go to tanning salons. If you like the look of suntanned skin, apply an over-the-counter self-tanning product. Many of these products include a sunscreen.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf you get a sunburn, take aspirin right away to help reduce the inflammation and relieve discomfort. Running cool water on the burned area or applying a cool cloth to the burn can help lower the temperature of the skin and reduce pain.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Basal Cell Carcinoma**]\nBasal cell carcinoma is the most common skin cancer. In basal cell carcinoma, cells just beneath the surface of the skin are damaged and become cancerous, usually from long-term exposure to strong sunlight. Basal cell carcinoma is common on skin areas that are regularly exposed to the sun, such as the nose or the back or, in men, the chest. Unlike many malignant growths, basal cell carcinoma usually does not spread to other parts of the body. If it spreads, it does so over a number of years. A large, untreated basal cell carcinoma can eventually destroy surrounding tissue and cause disfigurement, but death from this cancer is rare.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nIn basal cell carcinoma, a small, flesh-colored, sometimes pearly lump with enlarged blood vessels appears on the skin (see page 119). The tumor grows slowly and develops a sore (ulcer) with a hard border and a raw, moist center that may bleed. Scabs may keep forming over the ulcer and the area may seem to heal, but the ulcer keeps returning.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nIf you have a basal cell carcinoma, your doctor will take a small sample from the tumor for examination under a microscope (biopsy). A basal cell cancer can be removed by cutting it out or destroying it with laser surgery (see page 1088), freezing (cryosurgery), burning with a high-frequency electric current (electrocautery), or radiation therapy (see page 23).\n\nIn a technique called Mohs surgery (see page 22), progressive layers of skin and surrounding tissue are sliced off parallel to the tumor and examined microscopically for the presence of cancer.

Often you can see other colors in the melanoma, such as gray, red, blue, or white. Sometimes a malignant melanoma may have no dark pigment at all. Melanomas appear asymmetrical (one half of the melanoma doesn't match the other half) and the edges may be jagged or blurred (a normal mole has a defined edge). Melanomas are usually larger than  $rac{1}{4}$  inch in diameter but can be smaller and can grow almost imperceptibly in an existing mole.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > ABCDEs of Skin Cancer]\nSee your doctor immediately if you notice any of these signs of skin cancer in a mole, or if a mole seems to be growing:\n\n- **Asymmetry** If you draw an imaginary line down the middle of the mole, each side is a different size or shape.\n- **Border** The mole has an irregular or blurred border.\n- **Color** The mole has more than one shade or color (such as black, brown, blue, red, and white).\n- **Diameter** The mole is larger than  $\\frac{1}{4}$  inch (about the size of the tip of a pencil eraser).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nIf you have signs of melanoma, your doctor will remove part or all of the tumor for examination under a microscope (biopsy). If a diagnosis of melanoma is confirmed, the mole or tumor and some of the surrounding tissue is removed surgically. Usually a skin graft (replacement skin taken from another part of the body) is done at the same time to cover the area that was removed, especially if the melanoma is large. In addition, the doctor will test nearby lymph nodes (called sentinel nodes) to see if they contain cancer cells. If it is possible that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, a doctor may recommend chemotherapy (see page 23) or immunotherapy (which strengthens the immune system to increase its ability to fight cancer cells; see page 22).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > Varicose Ulcers]\nIf you have stretched or twisted veins directly under the skin, especially in the legs (varicose veins; see pages 125 and 602), you have poor circulation. Blood flow through the lower parts of your body (especially the calves, ankles, and feet) becomes sluggish, making small injuries or cracks in the skin less likely to heal, often causing them to enlarge and gradually become ulcers (sores). Varicose ulcers are more common in older people, pregnant women, and people who are obese or confined to bed.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nVaricose ulcers are shallow sores that can become infected. They may heal and continuously recur or not heal at all. Varicose ulcers usually occur on the inside of the leg just above the ankle. The skin around the ulcer turns red and then brownish purple and is itchy and flaky. The ankles often swell.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA doctor can usually diagnose a varicose ulcer by its appearance. He or she may order an ultrasound (see page 111) of the legs to rule out another disorder.\n\nIf you have a varicose ulcer, your doctor will recommend that you avoid standing for long periods (but walk regularly), keep the affected area raised (preferably above the level of your heart) as often as possible (even while lying down), and wear an elastic support stocking during the day. He or she may show you how to clean the ulcer. Clean the ulcer often and keep it covered with a bandage.\n\nIf the ulcer is severe, the doctor may coat it with a medication specially formulated to soothe and heal wounds, and bandage it. You may need to have a skin graft (replacement skin taken from another part of the body) to cover the affected area and promote healing. If more serious complications develop, your doctor may prescribe a medication called bacaplermin, which contains a natural blood factor that improves healing. If the ulcer gets worse, you may have to be hospitalized.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Epidermal Cysts**]\nEpidermal cysts (also called sebaceous cysts) are benign (noncancerous) cysts that originate in the epidermis (the thin, protective outer skin layer made up mostly of dead cells). An epidermal cyst is formed when keratin (the hard substance that is the main component of the epidermis) blocks a sebaceous gland, producing a cyst that grows slowly over many years. Epidermal cysts are common and sometimes are associated with acne (see page 1065).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nAn epidermal cyst looks like a pale lump beneath the skin (see page 122), and may have a narrow pore that is visible on the surface of the skin. If the cyst becomes infected, it fills with pus and becomes red, inflamed, and tender and may eventually burst.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nDoctors can diagnose an epidermal cyst by its appearance. If a cyst is not infected, no treatment is necessary, and the cyst may eventually go away on its own.

However, because the symptoms of lichen planus resemble the symptoms of other, sometimes serious, skin disorders, the doctor may take a sample of skin cells for examination under a microscope (biopsy) to rule out cancer or other disorders. If a diagnosis of lichen planus is confirmed, the doctor will recommend a corticosteroid ointment to apply to the rash to reduce the inflammation; this medication usually clears up the rash. Treatment is repeated if the rash recurs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment* > **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus**]\nDiscoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic skin disorder of unknown cause. The skin rash of discoid lupus resembles that of systemic lupus erythematosus (see page 920), but discoid lupus has none of the other symptoms of systemic lupus. Discoid lupus is more common in women than in men and usually develops between ages 30 and 40.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nDiscoid lupus usually takes the form of a red, itchy, scaly rash on the bridge of the nose and cheeks (often shaped like a butterfly; see page 124). However, circular patches of the rash may appear in other skin areas (particularly those exposed to the sun) with or without the butterfly rash on the face. When the patches of skin heal, they may be thin, pale, and scarred.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nIf you have symptoms of discoid lupus, your doctor will perform a physical examination and tests to rule out systemic lupus. If you have discoid lupus, the doctor will recommend protecting the affected areas of your skin with a sunblock or clothing. This is often the only treatment necessary.\n\nIf more treatment is needed, your doctor will prescribe an anti-inflammatory medication such as chloroquine or dapsone. A topical corticosteroid cream can help reduce inflammation and improve the appearance of the rash; however, long-term use of corticosteroids is not recommended because they can thin the skin and the symptoms recur when the medication is stopped.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Vitiligo]\nVitiligo is a common disorder in which patches of skin lose their color (pigment), usually on the face and hands (see page 118) and in the armpits and groin. The condition seems to be an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the pigment-producing cells in the skin. The loss of pigmentation is especially obvious in people who have dark skin. The condition may occur in cycles and then stop altogether.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nIn vitiligo, the irregular, unpigmented patches of skin often appear symmetrically on both sides of the body. The patches may grow, shrink, or stay the same size and, because they lack protective pigment, are especially sensitive to sunlight. In severe cases, the condition affects the whole body.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosis and Treatment]\nA doctor can usually diagnose vitiligo by its appearance. He or she may order a skin biopsy to rule out other disorders.\n\nThere is no cure for vitiligo. In rare cases, pigment returns to the skin. Makeup, self-tanners, dyes that color the skin, or tattooing small areas of skin with a skin-colored pigment can darken the lighter areas. It is important to protect these nonpigmented areas from sunburn (see page 1067) with a sunblock that has an SPF of at least 15. Topical corticosteroid medications or phototherapy (light therapy) can help temporarily return pigment to small areas. To even out their skin tone, some people choose to have the\n\nremaining pigment permanently removed from their skin with a chemical. In rare cases, skin grafts (transferring skin from one part of the body to another) are done, but they seldom result in a total return of pigment.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Tinea Infections]\nTinea is a fungus that can infect the skin, hair, or nails. As the fungus grows, it spreads out in a circle, leaving normal-looking skin in the middle that makes the growth look like a ring. The skin at the edge of the ring is lifted up slightly and looks red and scaly. Because the infection can look like a worm under the skin, it is sometimes referred to as ringworm. On the feet, a tinea infection is called athlete's foot; in the genital area or groin, it is called jock itch. The fungus can spread easily from person to person by direct contact or in showers, bathrooms, or locker rooms, and can be transmitted to people from cats, dogs, or farm animals.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Tinea Infections > Athlete's foot]\nYou can get athlete's foot (tinea pedis; see page 123) from direct contact with the fungus or contact with contaminated skin cells shed from an infected person. If the fungus spreads to the toenails, it makes them thick and crumbly. The fungus also can spread from the feet to the hands and fingernails.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Tinea Infections > Jock itc", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "corticosteroid", "relation": "treats", "tail": "lichen planus"}, {"head": "corticosteroid", "relation": "apply to", "tail": "rash"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "refer", "tail": "[Event: dermatologist]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "diagnose", "tail": "[Event: lichen planus by its appearance]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "take a sample of skin cells for examination under a microscope (biopsy)", "tail": "[Event: to rule out cancer or other disorders]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "recommend", "tail": "[Event: corticosteroid ointment]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: biopsy]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: diagnosis of lichen planus is confirmed]"}, {"head": "[Event: rash recurs]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: treatment is repeated]"}]}, "status": "success"}

The area around the sore usually is swollen. The sore forms a blister and then an ulcer (open sore), which develops a black scab (see page 125) that dries and falls off within a couple of weeks. In some cases, a fever and headache develop, and lymph nodes in the area of the infection become swollen and painful.\n\nTo diagnose skin anthrax, a doctor performs a biopsy, in which a sample from a sore is examined under a microscope to look for the anthrax bacterium.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf you have cutaneous anthrax, your doctor will prescribe one of several oral antibiotics that are effective against the bacterium, such as penicillin, doxycycline, or\n\nciprofloxacin. (During a suspected outbreak, ciprofloxacin is the antibiotic that is likely to be prescribed.) You probably will have to take the medication for about 60 days, because it can take up to 60 days for anthrax spores to germinate (and potentially cause further infection). There is no known transmission of cutaneous anthrax from person to person.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Hair and Nails]\nHair and nails are dead, hardened structures that are similar chemically to the surface layer of your skin. The substance that gives both hair and nails their hardness is a protein called keratin, which is found in smaller amounts in the top layer of the skin. Hair grows from follicles, which are pits of actively dividing cells that occur in varying numbers in the skin. Nails grow from special folds in the skin. Disorders that affect the hair and nails are usually cosmetic and generally not harmful to health.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Hair and Nails > Hair]\nHair is a threadlike structure composed of dead cells filled with keratin (a type of protein). Shafts of hair grow from tiny pits in the skin called hair follicles. The root of the hair is embedded in the skin and, in its growing phase, is firmly enclosed by live tissue called a bulb. Hair is surrounded by sebaceous (oil) glands and arrector pili muscles, which pull hairs erect.\n\nEach hair consists of a central, spongy, semi-hollow core called the medulla. The medulla is surrounded by a layer of long, thin fibers called the cortex. On the outside of each hair are several layers of overlapping cells called the cuticle.\n\n![Diagram illustrating a cross section of a hair follicle and surrounding skin. The diagram shows the Hair follicle, Root, Bulb, Arrector pili muscle, and a magnified Cross section of hair showing the Cuticle, Cortex, and Medulla. A Sebaceous (oil) gland is also indicated.]()![](_page_1993_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Dandruff]\nDandruff is a condition in which small, dead flakes of skin develop on the scalp when skin cells grow unusually fast. The two main causes of dandruff are a mild form of seborrheic dermatitis (see page 1063) and, less frequently, psoriasis (see page 1064) of the scalp. The hair itself is not affected.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTo treat dandruff, use an over-the-counter antidandruff shampoo as often as recommended on the label (usually every day or every other day). Make sure the shampoo contains one or more of the following ingredients: tar, selenium, sulfur, salicylic acid, zinc, or ketoconazole. For best results, lather twice each time you shampoo (the first time for 1 minute, then rinse, and the second time for 5 minutes). If regular use of the shampoo does not clear up your dandruff, your doctor may prescribe a corticosteroid lotion, or a lotion that contains a higher concentration of one of the ingredients in the antidandruff shampoo to apply to your scalp.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Ingrown Hairs]\nIngrown hairs (also known as shaving bumps, razor bumps, or pseudofolliculitis barbae; see page 121) are hairs that become trapped in hair follicles. They usually result from close shaving but can occur for unknown reasons. Ingrown hairs are common, especially on the face in men and in people who have curly hair.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Treatment*]\nIngrown hairs cause small, hard bumps or swellings around hair follicles. The bumps can become inflamed and painful if they become infected.\n\nTo treat inflamed ingrown hairs, your doctor may recommend applying an over-the-counter acne medication that contains benzoyl peroxide (which loosens the hair by causing the skin to peel) or an over-the-counter antibiotic cream. Your doctor may prescribe a stronger acne medication such as tretinoin, or topical or oral antibiotics. If the problem is severe, your doctor may recommend that you stop shaving or have the hair in the areas that you normally shave permanently removed by electrolysis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Preventing Ingrown Hairs]\nYou can prevent ingrown hairs from shaving by following these tips:\n\n- Before shaving, wash the area gently with mild s", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "anthrax", "relation": "treats", "tail": "cutaneous anthrax"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "performs", "tail": "biopsy"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "performs", "tail": "[Event: biopsy]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "develops", "tail": "[Event: fever and headache]"}, {"head": "lymph nodes", "relation": "become", "tail": "[Event: swollen and painful]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment]"}, {"head": "[Event: blister forms]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: ulcer develops]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Many people use hairpieces to cover a balding scalp. air-replacement surgery (see page 1096) is one of the most common cosmetic procedures performed on men.\n\nTreatment with the topical over-the-counter medication minoxidil (available in a 2 percent solution for women and a 5 percent solution for men) produces a fine growth of downy hair in some men and women in 4 to 6 months. In 6 to 12 months, the new hair may eventually be about the same thickness as the rest of the hair. However, hair growth stops if the treatment is stopped. An oral medication called finasteride has been shown to be effective in about half of cases of male pattern baldness. It may take more than 6 months for the drug to produce noticeable results. To treat baldness in women, the blood pressure medication spironolactone is prescribed to lower the levels of the male hormones that are often linked to hair loss in women.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Folliculitis]\nFolliculitis is infection of the hair follicles, which can occur anywhere on the skin or scalp. Most cases are caused by staphylococcal bacteria and usually result from hair-removal methods such as shaving, tweezing, or waxing. A type of folliculitis can develop from exposure to a bacterium called *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, which can survive in hot tubs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nFolliculitis is characterized by an itchy, bumpy, red rash (see page 125) that appears within 2 days of exposure to the bacterium. The bumps may develop into dark red tender lumps (nodules) or may develop small, pus-filled blisters.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosis and Treatment]\nYour doctor will suspect folliculitis by the appearance of the rash or if you have used a hot tub within the past 3 days. For mild cases, treatment is usually unnecessary because the infection tends to clear up on its own. Your doctor may recommend a topical antibiotic cream or lotion to apply to the rash to eliminate the bacteria, and an oral or topical medication to reduce the itching.\n\nFor severe cases, a doctor may prescribe an oral antibiotic such as tetracycline, minocycline, ciprofloxacin, penicillin, or cephalosporin to take for 4 to 6 weeks. If you have chronic or recurring infections, your doctor will recommend letting your hair grow in the affected area for at least 3 months to help clear up the infection. If the folliculitis resulted from exposure to bacteria in a hot tub, your doctor will tell you how to control\n\nthe pH (acid) and chlorine content of the water in the hot tub to eliminate bacteria and prevent more from growing.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Paronychia]\nParonychia is infection of the cuticle or skin fold at the base or sides of a nail. The infection is usually caused by a bacterium (such as staphylococcus or pseudomonas) or a fungus (such as Candida) and is common in people who spend a lot of time with their hands in water. The infection comes on suddenly when it is caused by bacteria. A fungal infection, which is usually less painful, develops slowly and frequently becomes chronic.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Paronychia > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of paronychia include a swollen, red, and painful cuticle or nail fold (see page 127). The cuticle may lift away from the base of the nail; if you press on the nail, pus may come out. When the fold of the nail is affected, a blister of pus (called a whitlow) develops on the side of the nail. The skin around the nail may also be affected. The cuticle no longer protects the root of the nail, allowing the root to be damaged and deforming or discoloring the nail. In a fungal infection, the nail can become thick, white, and powdery.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Paronychia > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA doctor can usually diagnose paronychia by its appearance. He or she may take a scraping from the nail to grow in a laboratory for examination under a microscope to identify the bacterium or fungus.\n\nYour doctor will treat a bacterial nail infection (in its early stages) with antibiotics, and a chronic fungal nail infection with an antifungal cream. If you have a pus-filled blister, he or she may pierce the blister, which will relieve the pain and speed healing.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > How to Keep Your Nails Healthy]\nThe following guidelines can help you keep your nails healthy:\n\n- Protect your nails and the skin surrounding them, especially when they are immersed in water, by wearing rubber or synthetic gloves over white cotton gloves (or rubber gloves into which you have sprinkled talcum powder).\n- Don't use strong soaps on your hands or feet. Strong soaps can dry out the nails as well as the skin. Use a moisturizer after washing. Over-the-counter creams are available that are formulated to moisturize the nails and make them resistant to damage.\n- Don't push back or cut your cuticles; they prevent germs from getting under your nail and causing inf", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "minoxidil", "relation": "treats", "tail": "baldness"}, {"head": "finasteride", "relation": "treats", "tail": "baldness"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

Cosmetic facial surgery encompasses a wide variety of procedures, including upper and lower eyelid surgery, forehead lifts, nose surgery, facelifts, facial implants, and collagen injections. Injections of botulinum toxin or collagen can improve the appearance of frown lines.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Nose Reshaping]\nPlastic surgeons perform surgery on the nose (known medically as rhinoplasty) to reshape the nose and correct breathing problems. Nose reshaping is the most commonly performed type of cosmetic surgery in the United States—more than 500,000 people have the procedure each year. Doctors recommend waiting to do nose-reshaping surgery until the nose has reached its full size, usually around age 14, unless a child's breathing is severely impeded. There is no upper age limit for nose reshaping. Many people\n\nrequest surgery on the nose at the same time as a facelift or other cosmetic surgery to correct age-related changes.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Nose Reshaping > Reshaping a nose]\nExcess cartilage in the bridge of the nose can produce an oversized or humped appearance (left). Cosmetic surgeons can reshape the nose by removing some of the cartilage (right).\n\n![Diagram illustrating nose reshaping.

The right side, labeled 'After nose reshaping', shows the same profile view but with 'Reduced cartilage' indicated, demonstrating the removal of excess cartilage to achieve a flatter appearance.]()![](_page_2003_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Nose Reshaping > *The Procedure*]\nDepending on the desired outcome, surgery can reduce or increase the bridge of your nose, decrease its size or width, make the nostrils narrower, or reshape the tip. Rhinoplasty can be either open or closed. In open rhinoplasty, the surgeon cuts the skin across the bottom of the center of the nose, separates the skin from the underlying bone and cartilage, reshapes the nose (by removing, adding to, or rearranging the underlying bone and cartilage), and then redrapes the skin. In closed rhinoplasty, the surgeon makes most of the incisions inside the nose, where they cannot be seen. In some cases, such as to narrow the nostrils, the surgeon may remove small wedges of skin from the area just under the nostrils. He or she closes the incisions with absorbable stitches (which don't need to be removed).\n\nAfter completing the surgery, the surgeon often protects and stabilizes the nose with a splint and may place packs or soft nasal splints inside the nose to secure the positioning of the cartilage between the nostrils. The packing inside the nose is removed the next day, but the splint must stay in place for 5 to 8 days.\n\nMost surgery on the nose is performed on an outpatient basis and takes 1 to 2 hours, although complicated procedures can take longer. Some procedures require general\n\nanesthesia, while others need only a local anesthetic combined with light sedation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *After Surgery*]\nYour nose will feel sore after the surgery, and you will have temporary nasal stuffiness, along with swelling and bruising around your nose and eyes.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *After Surgery* > **Incisions for rhinoplasty**]\nTo perform closed rhinoplasty, the surgeon makes most of the incisions inside the nose. Sometimes the surgeon removes small wedges of skin from the area just under the nostrils. The incisions are closed with absorbable stitches that do not need to be removed.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the incisions for closed rhinoplasty. The incisions are shown inside the nose, extending from the nostrils. Text labels indicate 'Incisions inside nose' and 'Tissue removed to narrow nostrils'.]()![](_page_2004_Picture_5.jpeg)\n\nYou may also have nosebleeds and headaches during the first week after surgery. To minimize swelling and bleeding, keep your head elevated, even while sleeping, and don't blow your nose for about a week after surgery. Avoid sun exposure for at least 8 weeks.\n\nThe main postsurgery risks are infection, bleeding, and broken blood vessels that leave permanent red spots on the skin of the nose. Nose reshaping alters the facial appearance so much that you may not look the way you expected, but more than 95 percent of people who have this type of surgery are satisfied with the outcome.\n\nMost people who have had nose-reshaping surgery can resume their normal activities in 1 or 2 weeks. The final appearance of the nose may not be apparent until about a year after surgery.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Eyelid Surgery**]\nEyelid surgery, known medically as blepharoplasty, is one of the most common cosmetic surgery procedures, with about 100,000 men and women undergoing the procedure in the United States every y", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "botulinum toxin", "relation": "treats", "tail": "frown lines"}, {"head": "collagen", "relation": "treats", "tail": "frown lines"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

In a forehead lift, surgeons remove excess tissue from the forehead and redrape the skin to smooth out the forehead and decrease the presence of frown lines.\n\nMost people who have forehead lifts are in their 40s, 50s, or 60s, although younger people may be good candidates if their brow droops excessively.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Eyelid Surgery > *The Procedure*]\nSurgeons can perform a forehead lift in two ways—endoscopic surgery or open surgery. Endoscopic surgery is the technique used most often. During the procedure, the surgeon makes several small incisions just behind the hairline and inserts a flexible viewing instrument called an endoscope into each incision. He or she then passes tiny surgical instruments through the endoscope to remove excess tissue. There is no need to redrape the forehead skin, and scarring is minimal.\n\nIn open surgery, a surgeon makes an incision either behind or directly at the person's hairline and removes excess tissue from the forehead. The incision can also be made inside one of the natural creases in the forehead; this option is usually used in men who\n\nalready have deep lines in their forehead. After removing the excess tissue, the surgeon replaces the forehead skin over the brow and stitches it in place.\n\nOpen forehead lift surgery takes 1 or 2 hours; endoscopic forehead lift surgery may take a bit longer. Done on an outpatient basis, either procedure may be performed using a local anesthetic (with sedation) or general anesthesia.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *After Surgery*]\nYou will probably experience headaches, swelling, and bruising during the first 3 weeks after surgery. You may also feel numbness and itching in your forehead and scalp for a few months. Some people lose some hair near the incision site, but the hair loss is usually temporary. Rare complications include infection, bleeding, and noticeable scarring.\n\nThe doctor will remove any stitches that are not dissolvable about 7 to 10 days after your surgery, at which time you will also be able to return to work and other routine activities. You can resume more vigorous activities after a few more weeks. You will need to limit sun exposure on your forehead for several months, even if you wear sunscreen. Prolonged bruising can be masked with makeup.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *After Surgery* > Reducing Frown Lines With Botulinum Toxin]\nMany people avoid surgery altogether by reducing their frown lines with injections of botulinum toxin type A, a protein made by the bacterium *Clostridium botulinum*. When a doctor injects the toxin into a facial muscle, it causes temporary paralysis of the muscle that lasts for several months. The paralyzed muscle is no longer able to pull the skin of the face into furrows, which relaxes wrinkling and smooths out the skin. The procedure works best on forehead lines, crow's feet around the eyes, and lines between the eyebrows. The procedure takes about 10 minutes, and the wrinkle-relaxing results take effect in about 1 to 5 days.\n\nBotulinum toxin should be injected using the lowest effective dose. Common side effects include mild swelling and numbness at the injection site, headache, bruising, a rash, nausea, and drooping eyelids, but these effects are temporary.

In any type of implant surgery, the surgeon makes a small incision near the desired location, forms a pocket between the skin and fat or muscle, inserts the implant, and then stitches the incision closed.\n\nChin implantation takes about 30 to 60 minutes. The incision is made either under the chin or inside the mouth at the base of the lower lip. To perform cheek implant surgery, the surgeon makes an incision either inside the lower eyelid or inside the upper lip. The surgery takes 1 to 1½ hours for both cheeks. In jaw implant surgery, which lasts 1 to 2 hours, the implant is inserted through an incision inside the lower lip. Lip implants, made of donor connective tissue or a synthetic gel, are injected or implanted directly into the lips.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *After Surgery*]\nFacial implant surgery produces temporary bruising and swelling. Activities such as eating and talking may be hampered for a brief period, depending on the site of the implant. The person may have to eat a liquid or soft food diet for several days. It may take months before the swelling goes down completely and the final facial configuration takes shape. While recovering, people who have implants need to take special care when brushing and flossing their teeth.\n\nRisks accompanying implant surgery include bleeding, infection, an asymmetrical appearance, numbness, and implants that shift out of place. If complications develop, the implant may have to be removed.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Collagen Injections]\nCollagen injection is a popular nonsurgical technique for giving the face a fuller, more youthful appearance by replacing the collagen that the skin naturally loses with age. Most collagen used for cosmetic purposes is a natural substance derived from the purified structural protein of cows. A few weeks before the procedure, the doctor tests the person for a possible allergic reaction to the collagen. Plastic surgeons most often inject collagen to treat frown lines, crow's feet, and the so-called laugh or smile lines that run from the nose to the mouth.\n\nFor the procedure, the doctor uses a tiny needle to inject the collagen (which is mixed with a local anesthetic) into the facial area being treated. More than one injection may be needed if the wrinkle is especially deep or long. The procedure can be completed in minutes, and you can go back to your daily activities immediately. The effects of collagen treatments last only a few months. Repeat treatments are needed to maintain the desired look.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Ear Surgery]\nPlastic surgery of the ear (medically known as otoplasty) is performed to position protruding ears closer to the head, decrease the size of overly large ears, repair earlobes that have been torn by injury, or replace an ear lost in an injury or missing at birth. Corrective surgery to fix protruding ears is usually done on children between ages 4 and 14. However, the surgery can be performed on older children and adults.\n\nIf your child has protruding ears and is not bothered by their appearance, wait until he or she expresses a desire for corrective surgery. Your child will be more cooperative during the process and happier with the results.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Ear Surgery > *The Procedure*]\nEar surgery is usually an outpatient procedure. Younger children are usually given general anesthesia so they can sleep through the surgery. Older children and adults are usually given a local anesthetic combined with light sedation. The surgery takes about 2 to 3 hours.\n\nThe surgeon makes an incision behind each ear, in the crease where the ear meets the head. The surgeon may remove or remold the cartilage in the ear to reduce or reshape the ear, or simply bend the cartilage back toward the head. Then the surgeon sews the\n\ncartilage into its new position with absorbable stitches, which do not need to be removed.\n\nThe surgeon places protective dressings over the ears that must stay in place for a week. Sometimes a person has to wear a headband over the ears for the first month after surgery to hold them in place as they heal.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *After Surgery*]\nThe doctor will recommend that the person get up and walk around a few hours after surgery. The incisions may hurt for a few days, but the doctor can prescribe medication to relieve the pain. The stitches usually dissolve in about a week, and the person will be able to return to school or work. However, he or she should be careful not to injure his or her ears. The scar is inconspicuous and will fade over time.\n\nRare complications of ear surgery include scarring caused by infection in the cartilage and a blood clot in the ear (which may go away on its own or can be drained with a needle).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Skin Rejuvenation]\nSkin rejuvenation or resurfacing refers to a number of tech", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "implant", "relation": "using", "tail": "anesthetic"}, {"head": "implant", "relation": "depending on", "tail": "type of implant"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "surgeon", "relation": "makes", "tail": "[Event: small incision]"}, {"head": "surgeon", "relation": "forms a pocket", "tail": "[Event: between skin and fat or muscle]"}, {"head": "surgeon", "relation": "inserts the implant", "tail": "[Event: inserting the implant]"}, {"head": "surgeon", "relation": "stitches the incision closed", "tail": "[Event: closing the incision]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: making a small incision]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: forming a pocket]"}, {"head": "[Event: inserting the implant]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: closing the incision]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Retinol is a prescription gel or cream containing retinoin, a substance that is chemically related to vitamin A. Skin preparations containing retinol reverse some of the skin damage caused by sun exposure, including fine lines, wrinkles, and age spots. The gel form is generally stronger than the cream. Doctors often prescribe retinol to people who are planning to have a chemical peel (see previous page) to pretreat their skin—retinol thins out the top layer of skin, which allows the chemical peel solution to penetrate more deeply. Retinol also is prescribed to treat severe acne.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Retinol Treatments > *Applying Retinol*]\nIt is best to apply retinol right before going to bed. Wash your face with a mild soap or cleanser, pat your face dry with a towel, and then let your face completely dry for about 15 minutes. Gently apply a pea-sized drop of retinol to your entire face, avoiding your\n\neyes. In the morning, apply a moisturizer containing a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15. Avoid sun exposure between 10 AM and 3 PM, when the sun is strongest. Continue this routine for 8 months to a year. After that, your doctor will probably put you on a less frequent application regimen. The rejuvenating effects of retinol will last only for as long as you apply it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Retinol Treatments > *After the Application*]\nAfter a retinol application, your skin may become red, dry, and irritated, especially during the first few weeks after you start using it. If the irritation becomes excessive, your doctor may recommend decreasing the application to every other night or every third night. Because retinol thins out the skin and makes the skin more sensitive to the sun, you need to be vigilant about wearing sunscreen and minimizing sun exposure. During the first few months of application, your skin will have a rosy glow. Within about 6 months, the fine wrinkles and age spots will disappear.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Retinol Treatments > **Dermabrasion**]\nDermabrasion, also known as dermaplaning, is the removal of the top layers of facial skin for cosmetic purposes using a handheld instrument with a small, high-speed, rotating wheel that has a rough surface similar to fine-grade sandpaper. The procedure is especially effective for removing fine wrinkles, particularly the vertical lines around the mouth. It also works well for facial scars, including those resulting from acne. The technique is less effective for burn scars. Doctors can perform dermabrasion on selected areas of the face as well as on the entire face. The final color of the treated area usually blends well with surrounding areas of skin.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Retinol Treatments > *The Procedure*]\nDermabrasion can take from a few minutes to more than an hour to complete, depending on the size of the area to be treated. If the treated area is small, a person may need only an anesthetic spray applied to numb the skin. Otherwise, either a local anesthetic with sedation or general anesthesia is used. Dermabrasion is almost always done on an outpatient basis. To perform the procedure, the doctor uses the rotating wheel to mechanically sand the parts of the face needing treatment.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *After the Procedure*]\nDermabrasion usually causes temporary swelling, tingling, burning, itching, and redness of the skin. Your doctor can give you medication to relieve the pain. A crust forms over the treated area and then falls off within 3 to 5 days, revealing new skin growth underneath. For the first 6 to 12 months after treatment, the new skin will be lighter than surrounding skin, sensitive to the sun (and more vulnerable to damage from the sun), and incapable of tanning because of loss of pigment. You will need to protect your new skin from sun exposure. Avoid direct and indirect sunlight and wear a wide-brimmed hat and sunblock outdoors.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *After the Procedure* > **Dermabrasion**]\nDermabrasion reduces fine lines, wrinkles, and acne scars by sanding away the top layer of skin using an instrument with a high-speed, rotating wheel.

A rotating tip is applied to the skin, and an inset shows the surface layer of skin being sanded away.]()![](_page_2018_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\nThe main risks of dermabrasion are infection, permanent scarring, and permanent skin-color abnormalities. Some people who have dermabrasion experience a recurrence of skin allergies or cold sores, brought on by the stress on the skin.\n\nYou will be able to hide the facial redness with makeup after about 2 weeks.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has restricted the use of implants filled with silicone gel to women who are in approved research studies.\n\nYour surgeon will decide the best way to insert the implant after performing a physical examination. Implants can be inserted through an incision in the natural fold under the breast, or through an incision around the areola (the dark skin around the nipple) or in the armpit.

Most breast augmentation is done on an outpatient basis.\n\nAfter making an incision, the surgeon will lift your skin and breast tissue to make a pocket either right behind the breast tissue or under your chest wall muscle. He or she will then insert the implant and center it under your nipples. The incision is closed with stitches. The surgeon repeats the process on the other breast. Gauze bandages may be placed over your breasts to help speed healing.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *After Surgery*]\nYou will probably feel tired and very sore for the first few days after surgery, but your surgeon will encourage you to get up and walk around immediately after surgery. He or she will prescribe pain medication to relieve the discomfort. Your breasts will look bruised and swollen and your nipples may burn for the first 2 weeks after surgery. The stitches are removed a week to 10 days after surgery. The soreness and swelling usually last about 3 to 5 weeks.\n\nYou may be able to go back to work in a few days. Your surgeon will tell you when you can begin exercising or lifting. Your scars will stay noticeably pink for several months and then begin to fade, although they will never disappear completely.\n\nThe most common complication of breast enlargement surgery is capsular contracture, in which scar tissue around the implant contracts and becomes tight. The tightening scar squeezes the implant, making the breast feel hard. Surgeons can treat this condition by surgically removing the scar tissue or making parallel cuts in it to widen it and make it more elastic. Another option is to remove or replace the implant.\n\nOther possible complications of breast enlargement surgery include excessive bleeding, infection, and numbness of the nipples or incisions. Sensation usually returns over time but loss of sensation can sometimes be permanent. Breast implants can break or leak after an injury or, occasionally, during routine activity. If an implant leaks, your body will absorb the saline solution contained in the implant, but the implant itself must be removed and replaced.

The type of procedure used depends on the degree of breast enlargement. For male breast reduction, most doctors use liposuction (see page 1093) to suction out the excess fat and tissue in the breasts. Liposuction is often combined with surgery to remove the tissue in a procedure similar to female breast reduction (see previous page).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Male Breast Reduction > *The Procedure*]\nMale breast reduction is done as an outpatient procedure using either general anesthesia or a local anesthetic with sedation. For both liposuction and surgery procedures, an incision is made in the lower half of the areola (the dark area surrounding the nipple). If the tissue is mostly fat, a small liposuction rod is inserted into the incision to remove excess fat and other tissue. If the tissue in the breast is more glandular, all the tissue directly under the nipple is removed surgically. The procedure usually takes 1 to 2 hours.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Male Breast Reduction > Gynecomastia]\nGynecomastia is excessive growth of the male breasts. In some cases, the breasts may even produce milk. Forty to 60 percent of all adult men have some form of gynecomastia. In adolescents, a mild degree of gynecomastia is normal. Most cases of gynecomastia in adults are caused by an excess amount of the female hormone estrogen in the blood. Men normally produce small amounts of estrogen, but some men produce an increased amount because of disorders such as obesity, a liver disease such as cirrhosis (see page 790), or hormone abnormalities. Gynecomastia also can be a side effect of taking some prescription medications, drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, or using marijuana. Rarely, gynecomastia is a symptom of breast cancer. In many cases, the cause is unknown. If the condition is caused by an\n\nunderlying disorder, it usually subsides once the underlying disorder is treated. Most cases are not severe enough to require surgery.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *After Surgery*]\nAfter breast reduction surgery, you may experience temporary swelling, bruising, numbness, soreness, or a burning sensation that can last from several days to 2 weeks. You can resume your usual activities within 3 to 7 days and engage in strenuous activities in 2 to 3 weeks. The swelling and bruising usually subside within 3 to 6 months. The doctor may recommend wearing a compression garment for several weeks after surgery to help relieve some of the symptoms. Besides the usual risks from surgery (such as infection), possible complications of breast reduction surgery include asymmetrical breasts, saggy skin, abnormal skin pigmentation, and excessive scarring.\n\nMost men are very happy with the results of breast reduction surgery, which are permanent. However, the procedure may have to be repeated if too little tissue was removed from inside the breast or if excess skin remains after the surgery.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Breast Lift**]\nA breast lift is cosmetic surgery that lifts and reshapes breasts that have sagged and stretched from pregnancy, breastfeeding, or aging. To perform a lift, excess skin is removed from the lower part of the breasts. Surgeons achieve the best results in women with small breasts because large, heavy breasts will begin to sag again after surgery. Breast lift surgery is not permanent, because no procedure can permanently halt the effects of gravity. If you plan to have children, consider delaying your breast lift until afterward because your breasts will probably stretch from pregnancy and breastfeeding.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *The Procedure*]\nA breast lift is usually performed on an outpatient basis while the woman is under general anesthesia. The procedure takes about 1½ to 3½ hours. During the procedure, the surgeon makes an incision that determines the boundaries of the area from which skin will be removed and locates a new position for the nipple. After removing the excess skin, the surgeon moves the nipple and areola into their new position and pulls\n\nthe remaining skin down and together to lift and reshape each breast. Some women with small breasts choose to have breast implants inserted during breast lift surgery. If so, the surgeon inserts the implant in a pocket under the breast tissue or behind the chest wall muscle. The surgeon then stitches the incisions closed.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *The Procedure* > Breast lift]\nA breast lift raises and reshapes breasts that have sagged and stretched from pregnancy, breastfeeding, or aging.

More extensive areas of the body are treated using regional anesthesia such as an epidural block (see page 532), the same type of anesthesia used for pain management during delivery of a baby. Removal of a large amount of fat requires general anesthesia and intravenous fluids and, in some cases, a blood transfusion.\n\nDuring a liposuction procedure, the surgeon makes a small incision in the skin over the area to be treated and inserts a narrow tube called a cannula under the skin. He or she pushes and pulls the tube through the underlying layer of fat and suctioned the fat away with a vacuum pump or syringe. When one site is finished, the surgeon moves to the next area until all the designated areas are treated. The small incisions are closed with stitches. During and after surgery, you will be given intravenous fluids to replace the fluids that were suctioned out with the fat.\n\nThe amount of time needed to perform liposuction can vary substantially, depending on the volume of fat being removed, the number of body sites being treated, and the technique used. In general, liposuction takes from 1 to 4 hours.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *After Surgery*]\nTo prevent fluid buildup, the surgical team will probably insert small drainage tubes under your skin. You may have to wear a tight-fitting elastic garment over the treated area for a few weeks to help minimize swelling. Pain, burning, bleeding, bruising, and temporary numbness are common. Your doctor will probably prescribe medication to help relieve any discomfort, along with antibiotics to prevent infection. Most people who have liposuction can go back to work a few days after the procedure. The stitches are removed or will dissolve on their own in 7 to 10 days.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > How liposuction is performed]\nDuring a liposuction procedure, the surgeon makes a small incision and inserts a narrow tube called a cannula under the skin. He or she pushes and pulls the cannula back and forth through the underlying layer of fat and suctiones the fat away with a vacuum pump or syringe. When one area is finished, the surgeon moves on to the next until all the specified areas are treated.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the liposuction procedure. A cannula is inserted into the body, targeting an 'Insertion site' and 'Insertion site' (likely indicating two points of insertion). The area being treated is shown as a dotted circle. The cannula is shown being pushed and pulled through the fat layer.]()![](_page_2031_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\nThe risks of liposuction increase with the size and number of areas to be treated. Although complications are rare, they can include infection or the formation of clots of fat or blood that can travel to the lungs and cause sudden death. Other risks include excessive fluid loss that can lead to shock (see page 579), fluid accumulation in the lungs, burns or other damage to the skin or nerves, and injury to a vital organ. As with all cosmetic surgery, there may be imperfections in your final appearance, including baggy skin or an asymmetrical body contour. After the swelling goes down, you will begin to see the improvement in your body shape in 4 to 6 weeks.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Abdominoplasty]\nAbdominoplasty (also known as a tummy tuck) is a cosmetic procedure that removes excess skin and fat from the abdominal area and tightens the muscles in the abdominal wall to flatten a protruding abdomen. The procedure can also remove existing scars and stretch marks. Abdominoplasty is considered major surgery and leaves a permanent scar that can extend from hip to hip.\n\nCosmetic surgeons perform more than 50,000 abdominoplasties in the United States each year. The best candidates for the procedure are people who are generally healthy but who have a large amount of abdominal fat or loose abdominal skin that they cannot\n\neliminate with dieting or exercise. The surgery may be especially beneficial to women whose abdominal muscles and skin have become stretched from multiple pregnancies. Older people whose skin has lost some elasticity may choose to have abdominoplasty to improve the contour of their abdomen.\n\nPeople who have only a small amount of excess fat mainly below the navel may qualify for a partial abdominoplasty, in which a wedge of skin and fat is removed from the lower abdomen, leaving a smaller horizontal scar above the pubic hair. The abdominal muscles still can be tightened and liposuction (see page 1093) can be performed above the navel or around the waist to treat problem areas.\n\nIf you intend to lose a substantial amount of weight or if you plan to become pregnant, you should delay having abdominoplasty.

More than 30,000 surgical hair replacement procedures are performed every year nationwide to fight hair loss. Most of these procedures are performed on men. Women can sometimes take advantage of hair replacement surgery but, because they lose hair from the entire scalp rather than just from the front and crown, hair replacement in women is more difficult and the outcome is often less successful. The most common surgical procedures used for hair loss are hair transplantation and scalp surgery, including tissue expansion, flap surgery, and scalp reduction surgery.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Hair Replacement Procedures > Hair Transplantation]\nHair transplantation is the surgical transfer of grafts of skin from a hair-growing part of the scalp to a bald part. The process requires multiple sessions interspersed with months of healing. The entire process can take up to 2 years to complete. Common transplant methods include circular punch grafts that each contain 10 to 15 hairs, minigrafts of 2 to 4 hairs, micrografts of 1 or 2 hairs, slit grafts inserted into slit incisions in the scalp, and strip grafts, which are longer slit-type grafts. Surgeons may combine one or more of these techniques to achieve the best results.\n\nSuccessful hair transplantation requires full, healthy hair growth at the back and sides of the head from which the surgeon can take the grafts. Because women generally experience uniform hair loss from all parts of their scalp, men (who tend to lose hair from only the front and crown) are usually better candidates for hair transplantation. Hair color and thickness can influence the results.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Hair Replacement Procedures > Hair transplantation]\nTo transplant hair, doctors surgically transfer grafts of skin from a hair-growing part of the scalp to a bald area. The process involves multiple grafting sessions. Grafts of hair are inserted into tiny openings in the scalp (left). During subsequent sessions the\n\nsurgeon fills in gaps between the original grafts with new grafts (center). After several grafting sessions over a period of up to 2 years, hair has filled in to form a natural hairline (right).\n\n![Illustration showing three stages of hair transplantation. The first stage shows a bald scalp with donor hair grafts placed in the center. The second stage shows the scalp with grafts filling in the gaps. The third stage shows the final result with a natural hairline.]()![](_page_2035_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *The Procedure*]\nBefore surgery, the surgeon will treat the areas from which hair will be taken (donor areas) and the areas to which hair will be grafted (recipient areas) with an anesthetic similar to the kind used by dentists. To perform a punch graft, the surgeon will use a tube-shaped instrument to punch out round skin grafts from the donor area. For the other techniques, surgeons use a scalpel to carefully remove small sections of scalp, which are then separated into tinier segments and transplanted to the recipient sites. The grafts are placed about 1/8 inch apart. Later grafts will fill in the spaces in between.\n\nThe surgeon will usually close the scalp incisions with a single stitch but may use more if needed. The entire scalp will then be gently cleansed and covered with gauze bandages.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *After Surgery*]\nAfter each grafting session, you may experience aching, throbbing, and tightness in your scalp, which can be controlled with pain medication. You may also have some swelling, bruising, and fluid drainage. Your bandages will be taken off the day after surgery, and you will be allowed to carefully wash your hair the day after that. A week to 10 days after surgery, the surgeon will remove the stitches. During the first month after surgery, you will have several follow-up appointments so he or she can monitor your progress.\n\nAvoid strenuous exercise for 3 weeks and abstain from sexual intercourse for about 10 days after the surgery because these activities can increase blood flow to the scalp and cause bleeding. The newly transplanted hair falls out about 6 weeks after surgery, which is normal. However, 5 or 6 weeks later, the hair will begin to grow back at a rate\n\nof about  $\\frac{1}{2}$  inch per month. Many people who have had hair transplants need additional touch-up grafts to make the results look more natural.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Scalp Surgery]\nScalp surgery can replace balding areas of the head with skin that grows hair using a number of specially developed techniques. The three most commonly used methods are tissue expansion, flap surgery, and scalp reduction surgery. Tissue expansion stretches the hair-bearing skin of the scalp so it can be used to cover bald areas. In flap surgery, the surgeon uses a flap of hair-growing skin from the side of the head to replace", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "hair loss", "relation": "causes", "tail": "surgical hair replacement procedures"}, {"head": "men", "relation": "are more likely to undergo", "tail": "hair transplantation and scalp surgery"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "women", "relation": "can sometimes take advantage of", "tail": "[Event: hair replacement surgery]"}, {"head": "people who have a family history of baldness", "relation": "are more likely to experience", "tail": "[Event: hair loss]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: hair transplantation and scalp surgery]", "relation": "is used to treat", "tail": "[Event: hair loss]"}, {"head": "[Event: tissue expansion, flap surgery, and scalp reduction surgery]", "relation": "are also used to treat", "tail": "[Event: hair loss]"}]}, "status": "success"}

This substance, called dental plaque, consists of mucus, food particles, and bacteria, and forms mainly between the teeth and where the teeth meet the gums. Bacteria in plaque break down the sugar in\n\nfood and produce acid. Over time, the acid dissolves the calcium and phosphate in the tooth's enamel and can form tiny holes called cavities, which are tooth decay.\n\nIf the decay is not treated, the acid destroys the enamel and damages the dentin beneath it. Dentin contains tiny canals that lead to the pulp; the bacteria eventually reach the pulp, causing inflammation. Your body's immune system responds by sending white blood cells to the pulp to fight the bacteria. The blood vessels around the tooth dilate (widen) to accommodate the extra blood and white cells. The widened vessels press on the nerves entering the tooth, causing a toothache. The acid may also reach the nerves, causing more pain, especially if the decay reaches nerve endings in the dentin. If a large number of bacteria invade the pulp chambers, the nerve of the tooth usually dies, because the white blood cells cannot overcome the infection. Once the nerve dies, the pain stops, but a pocket of pus may begin to form in the tissue around the tip of the root of a tooth (tooth abscess; see page 1104).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Tooth Decay > Cavities]\nIf the enamel of a tooth has been eroded, bacteria in the mouth can destroy the dentin. If the decay is not treated, the bacteria can reach the pulp chamber, causing pain and inflammation.\n\n![Diagram of a cross-section of a tooth showing the layers: Enamel, Dentin, and Pulp chamber. A cavity is indicated in the Dentin layer.]()![](_page_2040_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\nFor most people, tooth decay has no serious health risks if it is detected and treated early. However, some people, such as those who have heart disease, are at serious risk if bacteria from an infected tooth enter the bloodstream and travel to the heart. Because an infection can damage the heart valves and can lead to congestive heart failure (see page 570), people who are at risk need to take prescription antibiotics to eliminate the infection before having a tooth removed. People who have a blood clotting disorder such as hemophilia (see page 618) or who are taking anticoagulation medication should consult their doctor before having a tooth removed because it might be difficult to stop the bleeding after the procedure. To prevent bleeding, the doctor may take precautions\n\nsuch as temporarily lowering the dosage of a person's anticoagulation medication or prescribing a clotting factor (a protein in blood that is essential for blood clotting) to a person who has a clotting disorder. If bleeding occurs, a dentist can stop it by stitching the socket closed or by applying pressure to the socket with sterile gauze pads.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Tooth Decay > *Symptoms*]\nThe early stages of tooth decay usually do not cause symptoms. In the later stages, the main symptom may be a mild toothache that occurs when you eat something sweet, sour, hot, or cold. As the cavity continues to grow, you may experience more intense pain and an unpleasant taste in your mouth that is produced by food and bacteria that are packed into the cavity.\n\nIn the final stage of decay, the pulp of the tooth becomes inflamed. If this occurs, you may have persistent pain after eating sweet, sour, hot, or cold food. You may also experience sharp, stabbing pains, sometimes in the jaw above or below the decayed tooth. It may be hard to tell which tooth is causing the pain.\n\nIf you have a persistent unpleasant taste in your mouth, if you have a toothache, or if your teeth seem unusually sensitive to the foods you eat, see your dentist. Early detection and treatment of tooth decay can help you avoid more extensive treatment and can help prevent more serious problems such as an infected root canal or tooth loss.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Tooth Decay > *Diagnosis*]\nDuring a dental checkup (see page 1103) your dentist will examine your teeth for early signs of tooth decay; evaluate the condition of existing restorations, such as fillings, crowns, or bridges; and inspect your gums and mouth for signs of infection or other problems. He or she may also take X-rays to check for hidden signs of decay, such as cavities between the teeth or bone loss below the gum line.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Tooth Decay > *Treatment*]\nIf a cavity is detected early, your dentist will clean and fill it to prevent further decay. If the decay is advanced, your dentist may recommend that you see an endodontist (a dentist who specializes in root canal treatment) for a root canal (see page 1104). In rare\n\ncases, a dentist will remove a tooth that is very badly decayed.

(If you use tobacco products, if you are pregnant, or if you have diabetes or a weakened immune system, your dentist will recommend frequent oral examinations.) Regular examinations are necessary not only to detect and treat tooth decay but also to check your general oral health. Neglected teeth and gums are vulnerable to the various disorders described in this chapter and can increase your risk of developing infections that can enter the bloodstream and threaten your health. Dentures, like natural teeth, need to be checked regularly, and all dentures eventually wear down and need to be replaced. If you have a full set of dentures and have no problems with them, you still need to see your dentist regularly for oral examinations.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Dental Checkup*]\nAt your regular dental checkups, the dentist or hygienist will usually ask you questions about your general health before the dentist examines your teeth. This information is vital and may affect your treatment. For example, people who have some heart conditions and have a tooth removed, or any other treatment that causes the gums to bleed, have an increased risk of bacterial endocarditis (see page 593). To prevent this complication in people who are at increased risk, a doctor may prescribe a course of antibiotics to eliminate any infection before the tooth is removed. Because stress can increase the level of glucose in the blood, people who have uncontrolled diabetes (see page 889) may become ill if they experience stress during treatment. The dentist will ask if you have any allergies, because people who have allergies may have a dangerous reaction to some drugs, such as penicillin. The dentist also needs to know about over-the-counter and prescription medications you are taking to help avoid possible harmful drug interactions. All dentists use universal precautions—such as wearing safety glasses, latex gloves, and a protective mask—to help prevent the possible spread of infection.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Dental Checkup* > **Dental examination**]\nDuring a checkup, your dentist will examine your teeth for early signs of decay. He or she also will examine your gums and mouth for signs of disease or other problems. The dentist also may take X-rays to look for signs of decay that are not detectable from a visual examination.\n\n![Line drawing illustration of a dentist examining a patient's mouth. The dentist is wearing a mask and gloves, and the patient is reclining. A magnified view of the patient's teeth is shown in the lower right corner.]()![](_page_2046_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\nDuring an oral examination, the dentist first carefully inspects your mouth—including the tongue, the roof of the mouth, the insides of the cheeks, and the salivary glands—for signs of any diseases that are not confined to the teeth. For example, gums that are red, puffy, tender, or receding (pulling away from the teeth) indicate periodontal disease (see page 1114). A white discoloration of the inside of the mouth may indicate that you have oral thrush (see page 744), leukoplakia (see page 744), or oral lichen planus (see page 745). The dentist then examines your teeth with a mirror and a needle-shaped probe, looking for color changes that may indicate decay or cracks that may indicate the beginning of a cavity. He or she also examines your fillings to see if any parts have chipped off or if any new cavities are developing around the edges of a filling. If you have bridges or dentures, the dentist will check them for fit and examine their effects on your gums and any remaining teeth.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Dental Checkup* > *Why Your Dentist Takes X-Rays*]\nEvery year or two, your dentist takes bitewing X-rays (one or two X-rays of each side of your mouth are taken while you bite down on a piece of wing-shaped plastic to hold the X-ray film in place) to check for problems that he or she cannot detect during a visual examination. Every 3 to 5 years, your dentist should take a full set of mouth X-rays or a panoramic X-ray. He or she should also take X-rays of any teeth that have been treated with a root canal (see below) to look for a possible tooth abscess (see right). The dentist may also use X-rays to check the growth of your wisdom teeth or to determine how much bone is supporting your teeth if you have periodontal disease (see page 1114).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Dental Checkup* > *Why Your Dentist Takes X-Rays* > **Bitewing X-rays**]\nOne method of taking X-rays of the teeth uses a small piece of X-ray film that is covered by a protective wing-shaped plastic casing that is gripped firmly between the teeth.\n\n![Illustration of a dentist using a dental instrument, likely a root canal instrument, on a patient's mouth.]()![](_page_2048_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Root Canal]\nAt the core of every healthy tooth is the pulp, tissue t", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "dentist", "relation": "recommend", "tail": "oral examinations"}, {"head": "oral health", "relation": "check", "tail": "regular examinations"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "dentist", "relation": "perform", "tail": "[Event: regular examinations]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "undergo", "tail": "[Event: oral examinations]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

The porcelain laminate is made in a lab and then glued onto the front surface of the tooth. The acrylic resin is applied to the tooth in thin layers.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the structure of a tooth and the application of a veneer. The diagram shows a cross-section of a tooth with layers labeled: Pulp, Dentin, Enamel, and Veneer.

In normal occlusion—the relationship between the upper and lower teeth when the mouth is closed—the upper teeth slightly overlap the lower teeth, and the cusps (points) of the molars mesh with the spaces between the opposing upper or lower teeth.\n\nHowever, few people have perfectly aligned teeth. Because a person inherits genetic characteristics from each of his or her parents, sometimes the two sets of characteristics do not match, resulting in misalignment of the teeth (malocclusion). For example, if your teeth are too big for your jaws, your teeth can develop only by sloping backward or\n\nforward, by turning, by rotating, or by overlapping adjacent teeth. If your teeth are too small for your jaws, there will be some spaces between your teeth. If your lower jaw is smaller than your upper jaw, the teeth in your upper jaw may protrude, causing a type of malocclusion called an overbite. If your lower jaw protrudes slightly, your permanent upper front teeth may bite just behind the lower teeth, causing a type of malocclusion called an underbite. In some people, the position of the back teeth may prevent the front teeth from meeting properly, causing a type of malocclusion called an open bite.\n\nHeredity is not the only cause of malocclusion. Crowding is sometimes the result of loss of primary teeth (baby teeth) through decay. For example, when primary molars are lost prematurely, the permanent molars move forward in the jaw to fill the gaps. Then, when the permanent premolars and canines appear, usually between ages 10 and 12, they are crowded or blocked out of the natural arch of the teeth. In some people, some permanent teeth may not appear at all.\n\nIn mild cases of crowding, a person has an increased risk of tooth decay and gum disease because it is more difficult to keep crowded teeth clean. In some people, severe crowding can lead to dental disease or difficulty chewing. Malocclusion can make some people self-conscious about their appearance. For them, orthodontic treatment not only can improve a faulty bite, but it can also improve their appearance and sense of well-being.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Poorly Aligned Teeth > *Treatment*]\nIf you are an adult with minor occlusion problems, such as a few crowded or twisted teeth, your dentist may recommend orthodontic treatment for cosmetic reasons or to prevent more serious problems. However, if your teeth are severely maloccluded, your dentist will probably recommend that you see an orthodontist for immediate treatment to prevent damage to or loss of your permanent teeth. An orthodontist is a dentist who specializes in treating malocclusion. Orthodontists undergo 2 to 3 years of additional training after graduating from dental school to obtain a certificate in orthodontics.\n\nIf you have a minor alignment problem, the orthodontist may remove some teeth or fit you with braces to correct the crowding or malocclusion. Many adults are choosing to wear braces and do not feel self-conscious about them. For some people, crowns (see page 1109) and bridges (see page 1110) can help correct the problem.\n\nIn some cases, severe malocclusion or jaws that protrude or recede may result from the size and shape of the jaw. In such cases, a person may need orthodontia or oral surgery to align the teeth and stabilize the bite. An oral surgeon can reposition or\n\nremove pieces of the jawbone and some teeth to correct the problem and create a normal occlusion.\n\nIf your child's teeth appear to be growing in crowded or misaligned, take him or her to a dentist for an examination. Depending on your child's age, the dentist may recommend that you take him or her to an orthodontist for evaluation and possible treatment. Orthodontia is usually most effective during childhood and early adolescence, when the teeth and jaws are growing and developing. Also, it is easier to move the teeth at this time because the bone that surrounds the teeth is soft and is still developing.\n\nBefore beginning treatment, the orthodontist takes X-rays of the teeth and jaw to determine if all of the child's permanen", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "porcelain laminate", "relation": "is made of", "tail": "material"}, {"head": "acrylic resin", "relation": "is applied to", "tail": "tooth"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

Keeping your teeth and gums in good condition is an essential component of good health.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Dental Treatments > *Cleaning and Polishing*]\nIf your teeth are coated with calculus (also called tartar), a chalky mineralized deposit of hardened plaque, the dentist or hygienist will remove the calculus with handheld instruments called scalers. Because they must be used both above and below the gum line, scalers can cause the gums to bleed slightly. After scaling, the dentist or hygienist polishes the teeth, because a smooth surface slows the formation of calculus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Dental Treatments > *Cleaning and Polishing* > **Cleaning and polishing the teeth**]\nAlong with daily brushing and flossing, regular professional cleaning and polishing can help prevent tooth decay and periodontal disease.

If the tooth is not filled, bacteria can reach the dentin inside the tooth and destroy it, and then attack the pulp. To prepare a tooth for filling, the dentist drills through the enamel and removes all traces of decay (center). He or she then shapes the hole to prevent the filling from falling out. The hole is then filled with a mixture of silver, tin, and mercury (right). If a filling will be visible, the dentist may use a white filling material made of quartz in a plastic resin.\n\nDiagram illustrating the stages of filling a tooth. The left panel shows a tooth with a hole labeled \"Decayed enamel\". The center panel shows the hole drilled out, labeled \"Decayed area drilled out\". The right panel shows the hole filled with a dark material labeled \"Filling\".\n\n![](_page_2057_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Fillings*]\nWhen a tooth is partly decayed or chipped, the dentist replaces the damaged area with a filling (see above). White fillings often are used on front teeth. Silver amalgam—a mixture of silver, tin, and mercury—is generally used on back teeth. If the treatment is likely to cause discomfort, the dentist will inject the gum with a local anesthetic. The dentist removes any decayed area and shapes the hole to retain the filling securely. If a front tooth is chipped, the dentist roughens the surface and bonds the filling to it. If a tooth is badly damaged or discolored, the dentist may use laminate veneers or acrylic resins to restore the appearance of the entire visible surface of the tooth. If the dentist uses a local anesthetic, be careful to avoid biting your lip or tongue while it is still numb.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Crowns*]\nWhen a tooth is severely decayed, broken, fractured, brittle, or discolored, the dentist usually recommends an artificial crown for it if the base of the tooth and the roots are in good condition. The dentist prepares the damaged tooth by reducing the size of the natural crown so an artificial crown can fit over it. He or she then takes an impression of the prepared tooth and sends the impression to a dental laboratory, where an artificial crown is fabricated.\n\nGenerally, a white porcelain crown is fitted on a tooth that can be seen. On back teeth, gold or a less expensive material is used. Porcelain that is fused to metal can also be used for crowns on back teeth. The treatment usually requires two visits—the first to prepare the tooth, and the second to fit and adjust the crown. Between visits the person usually wears a temporary crown fitted by the dentist. The life of a permanent crown is usually about 5 to 8 years, but may be extended in people who do not grind their teeth or bite their fingernails and who avoid chewing on hard foods or ice.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Crowns* > **Fitting a tooth with a crown**]\nA broken, cracked, or heavily filled tooth can be repaired with a crown.

Also, the teeth may be impacted (blocked under the gum, usually because of overcrowding), which prevents them from emerging through the\n\ngum. The teeth that are most often impacted are the upper canines, premolars, and wisdom teeth.\n\nEven one missing molar can cause problems. For example, when you chew, your jaw moves from side to side and up and down. If a molar fits into an empty space in the row of teeth above or below it, your jaw will not move easily from side to side. Because this condition can prevent you from chewing properly, your dentist will probably remove the molar or grind down high points (called cusps).\n\nThe remaining teeth naturally tend to tip toward the spaces left by missing teeth. To do so, they may emerge too much from the gum or grow at an angle, causing the teeth to be poorly aligned (see page 1106), which prevents the teeth from coming together properly when you bite or chew. A faulty bite places extra stress on your teeth and jaw; this stress can lead to temporomandibular disorder (see page 1005), a condition that causes discomfort and pain in the joints of the jaw. Misalignment can also wear down some teeth.\n\nIf teeth grow into gaps at an angle, the surfaces of the teeth may be difficult to clean. Plaque can build up in hard-to-reach places and lead to tooth decay and periodontal disease (see page 1114).", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "teeth", "relation": "are lost from", "tail": "decay or injury"}, {"head": "tooth", "relation": "may be missing if", "tail": "it has failed to develop"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

You should also see your dentist if you have any missing teeth since childhood or are experiencing any problems caused by missing teeth.\n\nA dentist may recommend treating a missing tooth with a bridge (see page 1110), a removable partial denture (see previous page), or a dental implant (see previous page). Your dentist may also refer you to an orthodontist, a dentist who specializes in treating irregularly positioned teeth. To treat any pain in the jaw caused by poorly aligned teeth, your dentist may fit a nightguard (see previous page) over your upper or lower teeth and gums or may grind down the high spots in your teeth to correct your bite.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Problems Caused by Wisdom Teeth**]\nThe last teeth at the back of your mouth are the third molars, or wisdom teeth. The four wisdom teeth usually appear between ages 17 and 21, but some people don't develop\n\nall four wisdom teeth. If one of your wisdom teeth fails to emerge, you probably will not have any symptoms. Missing wisdom teeth are not a cause for concern unless they have failed to emerge because they are impacted (blocked under the gum, usually because of overcrowding).\n\nWisdom teeth are difficult to clean and, therefore, decay more easily than other teeth. For example, if a wisdom tooth emerges at an angle, the space between the wisdom tooth and the next tooth can trap plaque and food particles, causing tooth decay or periodontal disease (see page 1114). Often a wisdom tooth fails to emerge properly because it becomes impacted, sometimes by the adjacent tooth. In this case, a pocket can form around the impacted tooth and collect plaque and food particles. Bacteria in the pocket may cause bad breath and an unpleasant taste in your mouth and can eventually cause an infection (called pericoronitis) around the impacted tooth.\n\nSymptoms of pericoronitis include pain when you bite down on the tooth or the gum partially covering the tooth, and redness and swelling of the gum around the tooth. If you have any of these symptoms, see your dentist or doctor as soon as possible.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Problems Caused by Wisdom Teeth** > Impacted wisdom tooth]\nThis impacted wisdom tooth is blocked as it grows at an angle against the adjacent tooth. Wisdom teeth are usually removed to prevent tooth decay or periodontal disease.\n\n![Diagram showing a row of teeth in the jaw. One tooth is labeled 'Impacted wisdom tooth', indicating it is growing at an angle and is blocked by the adjacent tooth.]()![](_page_2065_Picture_5.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Problems Caused by Wisdom Teeth** > *Treatment*]\nThe long-term solution for an impacted wisdom tooth is to remove it, which is the only way to treat a recurring infection or prevent future infection. If you have an infected impacted tooth, using a topical over-the-counter anesthetic, taking aspirin, and rinsing the area around the tooth with warm salted water can relieve pain until you can see your dentist.\n\nYour dentist will take X-rays to determine the position of the tooth. If there is no sign of infection and the tooth can be easily removed, your dentist will extract it after injecting a local anesthetic. If the area around the tooth is infected, he or she will prescribe an antibiotic to eliminate the infection before removing the tooth\n\nIf the tooth lies at an angle that would make it difficult to extract (or if you have other impacted wisdom teeth that need to be removed), your dentist may refer you to an oral surgeon who can more easily remove the tooth (or teeth). You will probably be given a local anesthetic and possibly a sedative. However, general anesthesia is sometimes required.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Denture Problems]\nMost dentures, or false teeth, look natural and fit well, but no denture is as efficient and comfortable as your own teeth. With natural teeth, the stresses of biting and chewing are absorbed by the teeth, the roots of the teeth, and the periodontal ligament (a tough, elastic, shock-absorbent tissue that holds bones together and lines the tooth sockets in the jawbone). With dentures, the stresses are absorbed in unnatural ways. The most critical of these stresses is the pressure that the baseplate (the false gums of the dentures) places on the ridges of the natural gums, especially if the dentures are worn both day and night. This pressure can cause inflammation of the gums and eventually can lead to mouth ulcers and to degeneration of the jawbone under the gum tissue.\n\nThe base of a partial denture also places abnormal pressure on the natural teeth that are used to anchor the denture base. Partial dentures, especially poorly fitting ones, can trap plaque and food particles, causing tooth decay in the remaining teeth and possibly leading to periodontal disease (see next pa", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "dentist", "relation": "recommend", "tail": "bridge"}, {"head": "dentist", "relation": "recommend", "tail": "removable partial denture"}, {"head": "dentist", "relation": "recommend", "tail": "dental implant"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "parent", "relation": "take to dentist", "tail": "[Event: examination]"}, {"head": "person", "relation": "see dentist", "tail": "[Event: examination for missing teeth]"}, {"head": "dentist", "relation": "refer to orthodontist", "tail": "[Event: treatment of irregularly positioned teeth]"}, {"head": "dentist", "relation": "fit nightguard", "tail": "[Event: treatment of jaw pain caused by poorly aligned teeth]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment]"}]}, "status": "success"}

If you already have gingivitis, try to brush and floss your teeth more carefully and thoroughly.\n\nFor more severe cases of gingivitis, the dentist removes any plaque and calculus from the base of the teeth. During a procedure called scaling, the dentist uses a handheld instrument called a scaler to remove plaque and calculus above and beneath the gum line. Ultrasonic scaling uses a high-frequency current to remove plaque and calculus. In a process called root planing, the dentist removes bacteria and other microorganisms by smoothing the surface of the root. In another technique, called subgingival debridement, the dentist removes tooth surface irritants from beneath the gum line to prevent infection in the treated area.\n\nSome people need to have their teeth cleaned professionally every few months despite careful tooth care. For these people, dentists often recommend an antibacterial mouthwash. Most cases of gingivitis respond well to treatment, and the gums gradually\n\nreturn to their usual healthy condition. It is up to you to take the steps necessary to prevent another case of gingivitis.\n\nPeriodontitis can often be treated and reversed before it reaches an advanced stage. See your dentist as soon as possible if you have any symptoms such as red, swollen gums. If the disease is at an early stage, your dentist can help keep it under control by treating any pockets, which encourage plaque to form. He or she may place inserts that contain antibiotics or anti-inflammatory drugs directly into the pockets to fight the infection. If treatment with antibiotics begins early, no other treatment may be necessary. Ask your dentist if you should use toothpastes and mouth rinses that contain medication or antimicrobial agents.

Without treatment, the disease progresses and can eventually lead to tooth loss. Healthy gums (left) fit firmly around the necks of the teeth and do not bleed easily. Plaque that builds up between the teeth and gums can cause painful inflammation (center). Untreated plaque can harden to form a substance called calculus, which can cause the gums to recede (right). The bacteria in calculus can cause severe damage to the teeth, gums, and jawbone.\n\n![Diagram illustrating three stages of gum disease. The left diagram shows Healthy gums. The middle diagram shows Inflamed gums with Plaque buildup. The right diagram shows Calculus formation, leading to Damaged gum pulling away from the tooth.]()![](_page_2070_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > Evaluating periodontal disease]\nThe bacteria in plaque can destroy the bone and gum tissue that surround and anchor the teeth. If not removed, plaque forms a hardened material called calculus, which can pry the gum away from the tooth, loosening it. Eventually the tooth may have to be removed. To evaluate the severity of periodontal disease, a dentist inserts an instrument called a periodontal probe between the tooth and gum (beneath the gum line) to measure and record the depth of the gum pockets. In general, the deeper the pocket, the more severe the disease.\n\n![Diagram illustrating a deep periodontal pocket. Labels include: Periodontal probe, Gum pocket, Bone loss, Exposed root, and Receding gums.]()![](_page_2071_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nIf the pockets between the teeth and gums are very deep, you may need periodontal surgery. A gingivectomy is a minor surgical procedure performed in the office by a periodontist (gum specialist) in which the soft tissue wall of the pocket is removed. If the bone has been damaged, you may need to undergo a procedure called osseous surgery, in which the periodontist removes infected tissue and reshapes the gum and bone. After the surgery, the gum line is covered with a protective coating called a periodontal pack, which is left in place for 1 to 2 weeks until the gum heals. You can eat and drink normally with a periodontal pack in place. In some cases, the periodontist or an oral surgeon performs a procedure called regenerative surgery, which uses special inserts to try to regrow the jawbone and supporting tissue.\n\nCementum that has been worn away can be replaced by bonding a synthetic material to the tooth. Cementum that is especially sensitive can be protected with a layer of sodium fluoride or a prescription toothpaste that protects against sensitivity. Very loose teeth can be anchored.\n\nThe bacteria that cause periodontitis can be transmitted among family members, so, if one member of your family has periodontal disease, all other family members should also see a dentist for a checkup and evaluation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > Gingivectomy]\nThe buildup of plaque and calculus between the teeth and gums forms a deep pocket (top) between them. During treatment, the pocket is cleaned and the soft-tissue wall of the pocket is removed (center).
