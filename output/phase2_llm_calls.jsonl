To make it easy for you to find the information you're looking for, the chapters in this part of the book are arranged by body system. The articles in these chapters have an easy-to-follow, straightforward format that usually includes the following headings: Symptoms (describes the most common symptoms and signs of the disorder), Diagnosis (explains how the disorder is diagnosed), Treatment (explores the treatment options for the disorder), and Prevention (tells how the disorder can be prevented, when prevention is possible).\n\nWithin the articles on specific diseases, you will also find cross-references to other parts of the book. Use these cross-references, along with the index, to add to your knowledge of or improve your understanding about a particular health problem or concern.\n\n[AMA_Family_Guide > Glossaries]\nThis section contains a general Glossary and a Drug Glossary. The general Glossary defines some common medical terms you might hear or read. The Drug Glossary has two sections—a section on drug classes (the groups into which drugs are categorized) and a section on the top 200 prescription drugs.\n\n[PART ONE > Healthy Eating]\nA wealth of information exists about the fundamental link between diet and health. Although many people think that healthy eating means flavorless, unsatisfying meals, this does not have to be the case. A healthy diet includes plenty of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, and other high-fiber, high-nutrient foods; supplies the right number of calories; and limits saturated fat and trans fats (such as those found in stick margarine), salt, sugar, and alcohol. The components of a healthy diet translate easily into delicious meals that can appeal to the whole family. For more about a nutritious diet, see pages 35 to 44.\n\n[PART ONE > Healthy Eating > Eat Five a Day for Better Health]\nWe have all heard from experts that eating at least five fruits and vegetables each day is one of the most important things we can do for our health, but only one out of four of us is actually eating this amount. Fruits and vegetables provide a wide assortment of vitamins and minerals, including the antioxidant vitamins—vitamin C, the carotenoids (beta carotene, lycopene, and lutein), and vitamin E—which fight cell damage from free radicals, a major cause of aging and most chronic diseases. Fruits and vegetables also provide fiber, an essential nutrient that promotes healthy bowel function and helps lower the risk of heart disease and some types of cancer. Fruits and vegetables are so good-tasting and so good for you that you should try to consume as many as you can. Five servings a day is the minimum for keeping you healthy (10 a day is better). Here are some tips to help you get your daily dose of fruits and veggies:\n\n- Have one or two servings of fruit at breakfast every day.\n- Choose a fruit or vegetable for a snack.\n- Have a salad at lunch.\n- Stock up on dried, canned, and frozen fruits and vegetables.\n- Serve more than one vegetable for dinner.\n\n[PART ONE > Healthy Eating > *Eat your colors*]\nFruits and vegetables come in an array of colors, and the color of a food usually says something about its nutritional value. Each food color confers specific health benefits,\n\nso consuming a variety of fruits and vegetables provides the biggest health gains.\n\n[PART ONE > BLUES AND PURPLES]\nBlueberries, blackberries, purple grapes, plums, raisins, and eggplants give you:\n\n- A reduced risk of some cancers\n- A healthy urinary tract\n- A sharp memory\n- A long, healthy life\n\n[PART ONE > GREENS]\nKiwi, honeydew melons, spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce, kale, green peas, brussels sprouts, cabbage, and Swiss chard give you:\n\n- Strong bones and teeth\n- Good eyesight\n- A reduced risk of some cancers\n\n[PART ONE > WHITES]\nPears, apples, bananas, jicama, mushrooms, cauliflower, onions, and garlic give you:\n\n- A healthy heart\n- A good cholesterol profile\n- A reduced risk of some cancers\n\n[PART ONE > REDS]\nWatermelon, strawberries, raspberries, cranberries, cherries, tomatoes, and radishes give you:\n\n- A sharp memory\n- A healthy heart\n- A healthy urinary tract\n- A reduced risk of some cancers\n\n[PART ONE > YELLOWS AND ORANGES]\nOranges, grapefruit, peaches, cantaloupe, mangoes, pineapples, yellow and winter squash, carrots, and corn give you:\n\n- A healthy heart\n- A healthy immune system\n- Good eyesight\n- A reduced risk of some cancers\n\n[PART ONE > Reading Food Labels > *Nutrition facts panel*]\nThe nutrition facts panel is the part of a food package label that lists serving size, the number of servings in the package, the number of calories i", "response": {"entity_entity": [], "entity_event": [{"head": "Patient", "relation": "participated in", "tail": "[Event: clinical trial]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

Regular exercise protects against the most common disorders—including heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, obesity, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, colon cancer, and depression—and can help you live longer. Still, more than 60 percent of adults in the US fail to get the minimum recommended amount of exercise: half an hour to an hour of moderate activity such as brisk walking on most days of the week. You don't have to do it all at one time: break up the time into 10- or 15-minute sessions scattered throughout the day. The activity you engage in doesn't have to be strenuous to provide health benefits, especially if you have been inactive for some time. Of course, the more vigorous the activity, the more you will get out of it, but what is most important is becoming more active.\n\n[PART ONE > Exercise > The Benefits of Exercise]\nIf exercise were packaged in a pill, it would be the No. 1 prescribed medication in the US—and Americans would be much healthier. Even a small increase in your physical activity can substantially reduce your health risks, especially if you have been inactive. More activity—or activity that is more vigorous—will pay even bigger rewards. In addition, regular exercise provides the following health advantages:\n\n- Lowers your risk of premature death.\n- Reduces your risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and some cancers.\n- Makes your heart pump more efficiently.\n- Fights depression and anxiety.\n- Improves strength, flexibility, and balance.\n- Helps you maintain a healthy weight.\n- Tones your muscles.\n- Helps control your appetite.\n- Keeps your mind sharp.\n- Makes you look better.\n- Boosts your self-confidence.\n\n[PART ONE > Fit Exercise Into Your Life]\nWhen you look at your busy life, a lot of things seem more important than exercise: your job, chauffeuring your kids to various activities, managing your household, or taking care of aging parents. And a lack of time may not be the only factor. Having too little money or social support—even bad weather—can all conspire against your best intentions to exercise. Here are some tips that might make it easier for you to begin an exercise program and stick with it:\n\n- Choose an exercise you enjoy.\n- Schedule time for exercise.\n- Find a workout buddy or take an exercise class.\n- Vary your activities to avoid boredom.\n- Fight inertia by remembering how good exercise makes you feel.\n\nIf you don't want to join a health club or can't make the time for a long workout several times a week, try to incorporate exercise into your daily life in the following ways to accumulate 30 to 60 minutes of exercise every day:\n\n- Climb up and down several flights of stairs at work once or twice a day.\n- Take a brisk walk after dinner.\n- Walk the dog.\n- Pull your children around the neighborhood in a wagon or sled.\n- Go to the local mall and walk.\n- Park in a parking space farther from the store or office and walk to the building.\n- Carry or push a golf bag instead of using a golf cart.\n- Wash and wax the car.\n- Do yard work.\n- Clean the house.\n- Jump rope.\n- Mow the lawn with a hand mower.\n- Lift hand weights, or do lunges, push-ups, and jumping jacks while you watch TV.\n- On the weekends, organize a family bike ride, hike, or ball game. Go swimming, ice skating, or in-line skating together. Go dancing.\n\n[PART ONE > Fit Exercise Into Your Life > Making time for exercise]\nIt's easier to fit exercise into your busy schedule if you make it part of your daily routine. Try walking up and down several flights of stairs at work every day. It takes only a few minutes and it strengthens your heart, lungs, and bones.\n\n![A man in an orange shirt and dark pants walking up a flight of stairs, illustrating the exercise mentioned in the text.]()![](_page_43_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n[PART ONE > Fit Exercise Into Your Life > Three Types of Exercise]\nThree different types of exercise—**aerobic**, **flexibility**, and **strengthening**—help you achieve different kinds of physical fitness. Aerobic exercise (such as walking, jogging, and cycling) increases your heart rate to deliver more oxygen to your muscles. Strengthening exercises (such as lifting weights and doing push-ups) build muscle and bone to increase strength. Flexibility exercises (such as stretching or yoga) improve your ability to move your joints through their full range of motion. Including all three types of activity in your exercise regimen will help you reach a high overall level of fitness that can improve your health and reduce your risk of several of the most common chronic diseases, including heart disease and diabetes.\n\nChoosing activities you enjoy will help you stay with your exercise program. Variety is the key, so don't limit yourself to one activity. Jog one day and swim or bike the next. Work out with weights one day and use a stair-climbing machine the next day.

Nearly two out of three adults and about 15 percent of children in the US are overweight. Most alarming, overweight children and adolescents are developing common chronic illnesses—such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes—that used to affect only adults.\n\nBody weight results from the complex interaction of inherited, physical, behavioral, socioeconomic, and cultural factors. The major factors contributing to overweight are basic—eating too much and exercising too little. And many Americans tend to eat the wrong kinds of foods: foods that are highly refined, high in salt, and often high in saturated and trans fats and calories and low in fiber.\n\n[PART ONE > Are You at a Healthy Weight? > Health Risks of Being Overweight]\nBeing overweight increases your risk of a number of chronic health problems, including heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and some cancers. The way in which fat is distributed on your body can also increase your health risks. You are at greater risk of health problems if you tend to accumulate fat around your abdomen than if you tend to accumulate fat around your hips and thighs. The risks increase further if your waist is 35 inches or larger (if you're a woman) or 40 inches or larger (if you're a man). To determine if you are overweight, check the BMI chart on the next page. To determine if your child is overweight, have him or her evaluated by the doctor. Your doctor can work with you to develop an effective weight-loss plan.\n\n[PART ONE > Are You at a Healthy", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "abdominal muscles", "relation": "uses", "tail": "keep back straight"}, {"head": "back", "relation": "keeps", "tail": "straight"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

Vitamins are divided into two categories—fat-soluble and water-soluble. Fat-soluble vitamins are found in fats and oils in foods and are stored in body fat. Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water and mix easily in the blood. Your body stores only small amounts of water-soluble vitamins (the excess is eliminated in urine). Some vitamins are antioxidants, which protect against damage to cells by free radicals (molecules formed by normal cell processes). Antioxidants can help protect against disease and aging. The best way to get the vitamins and minerals your body needs is to eat a varied diet rich in low-fat, high-fiber vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains; fish; and low-fat dairy products, poultry, and meats.\n\n| Vitamin or mineral                      | Good sources                                                                                     | Health benefits                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                       |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| <strong>FAT-SOLUBLE VITAMINS</strong>   |                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Vitamin A                               | <img alt=\"A bottle of milk labeled MILK\"/>                                                       | Fortified milk, eggs, cheese, butter, liver, cod and halibut, fish oil                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Antioxidant; essential for growth and development; maintains healthy vision, skin, and mucous membranes.                                              |\n| Vitamin D                               |                                                                                                  | Salmon, mackerel, fortified milk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Builds bones and teeth; helps the body absorb and use calcium.                                                                                        |\n| Vitamin E                               | <img alt=\"A dark green leafy vegetable, likely kale\"/>                                           | Vegetable oils, whole grains, wheat germ, nuts, green leafy vegetables                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Antioxidant; anti-inflammatory; helps form blood cells, muscles, and lung and nerve tissue; boosts the immune system; may help prevent heart disease. |\n| Vitamin K                               | Dark green leafy vegetables, liver, egg yolks                                                    | Essential for blood clotting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Beta carotene   ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "vitamins", "relation": "are found in", "tail": "foods"}, {"head": "fat-soluble vitamins", "relation": "are stored in", "tail": "body fat"}, {"head": "water-soluble vitamins", "relation": "dissolve in", "tail": "water"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "your body", "relation": "stores", "tail": "[Event: small amounts of water-soluble vitamins]"}, {"head": "excess", "relation": "is eliminated in", "tail": "[Event: urine]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

When you experience stress, your body makes two hormones, cortisol and adrenaline, that help you deal with the tense situation. Over the long term, however, too much of these hormones produced for too long can cause anxiety and physical symptoms that can trigger or worsen illnesses such as high blood pressure, asthma, or heart disease. Persistent, prolonged stress can also adversely affect your immune system, making you more susceptible to infections and other illnesses.\n\nA number of natural ways to reduce stress—such as deep breathing, yoga, meditation, biofeedback, exercise, and massage—have been proven to be effective. Try all of them until you find what works best for you. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (see page 710) provided by a mental health professional can also be helpful. If you feel overwhelmed by the stress in your life, talk with your doctor about effective stress-reduction methods (see page 58).\n\n[Stress > It's Not All in Your Mind]\nStress can affect your body in a number of ways. Chronic, long-term stress can be especially harmful.

A persistent release of the stress hormone cortisol can kill brain cells directly, causing memory and learning problems.\n\n[Stress > It's Not All in Your Mind > Heart]\nHeaviness or pain in the chest (angina), rapid heartbeat, and abnormal heart rhythms can occur during or shortly after periods of stress.\n\n[Stress > Digestive tract]\nStress can cause or worsen disorders or diseases of the digestive tract such as indigestion, peptic ulcers, and irritable bowel syndrome. Severe stress can slow digestion.\n\n[Stress > Abdominal fat]\nProlonged or severe stress can cause fat to be deposited at the waist rather than on the hips and buttocks, increasing the risk of heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and other illnesses.\n\n[Stress > Bones]\nHigh levels of the stress hormone cortisol can cause bone loss.\n\n[Stress > Skin]\nSome people have outbreaks of skin problems such as eczema and psoriasis when they are under stress. Stress also can increase perspiration.\n\n[Stress > Mouth]\nTeeth grinding, mouth ulcers, and dry mouth seem to occur more often during times of stress.\n\n[Stress > Lungs]\nPeople with asthma often find that their condition worsens when they are under stress. Stress can also speed up breathing.\n\n[Stress > Bladder]\nStress can trigger an urgent need to urinate.\n\n[Stress > Reproductive organs]\nSevere stress can suppress the reproductive system, causing absence of periods in women and erection problems and premature ejaculation in men.\n\n[Stress > Muscles]\nMinor muscular tics become more noticeable, especially on the face and hands, and muscles often become tense when a person is under stress.\n\n[Stress > Immune system]\nWhen a person is under stress, the immune system can become weakened, increasing the risk of infections and other illnesses.\n\n![A man sitting in an office chair, looking stressed, with his head resting on his hand, illustrating the effects of stress on the body.]()![](_page_58_Picture_6.jpeg)\n\n[Stress > Don't Cheat on Sleep]\nWhen it comes to stress, sleep is like medicine, but sometimes you can get caught in a vicious circle. You can't sleep because you feel stressed, and the lack of sleep causes more stress, which affects your sleep. Lacking sufficient sleep for a long period can have harmful effects on your mind and body. Lack of sleep can increase your risk of type 2 diabetes, lower your resistance to illness, and raise your blood pressure—all important reasons to take sleep more seriously.\n\nIf you're going through a high-stress period, one way to make sure you get a good night's sleep is to shift your focus away from your daytime worries. When you go to bed at night, try to keep yourself from brooding over your daily problems and concerns. Things always seem worse in the middle of the night. Try to look at sleep as an escape from the stresses of the day, not a time for replaying them in your mind.\n\nA midafternoon nap is another way to make up for insufficient sleep at night. Even a short, 20-minute nap will refresh you and improve your mental performance. Just make sure you finish your nap before 3 in the afternoon; napping later can make it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.\n\nTry the tips on pages 57 and 58; they can help you improve your sleep. If you experience sleeplessness for longer than 6 weeks and these suggestions don't seem to help, talk to your doctor. He or she may refer you to a sleep center for treatment.\n\n![A woman lying in bed, resting her head on her hand, appearing to be ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "cortisol", "relation": "produced by", "tail": "body"}, {"head": "adrenaline", "relation": "produced by", "tail": "body"}, {"head": "high blood pressure", "relation": "triggered or worsened by", "tail": "stress"}, {"head": "asthma", "relation": "triggered or worsened by", "tail": "stress"}, {"head": "heart disease", "relation": "triggered or worsened by", "tail": "stress"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "body", "relation": "makes", "tail": "[Event: hormones]"}, {"head": "hormones", "relation": "help deal with tense situation", "tail": "[Event: stress]"}, {"head": "stress", "relation": "affects immune system", "tail": "[Event: infections and illnesses]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: too much hormones produced for too long]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: anxiety and physical symptoms]"}, {"head": "[Event: persistent, prolonged stress]", "relation": "adversely affects", "tail": "[Event: immune system]"}]}, "status": "success"}

It's common to forget where you put your keys—at any age. You don't need to worry about having a memory problem unless you forget what the keys are for. Practicing memory exercises such as the following can help you keep your memory sharp as you age:\n\n- Memorize some poetry.\n- Look at a photograph; then look away. Write down all the items in the photo that you remember—for example, how many people, animals, buildings, and other objects—and see how well you did.\n- Pick up a paper clip, spool of thread, or other common object. Try to figure out a new use for the object.\n- Draw a floor plan of your childhood home, complete with doors, windows, and furniture placement.

Elevated levels of homocysteine can damage cells in the area of the brain involved with learning and memory.\n- **Anti-inflammatory drugs** Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications (such as aspirin and ibuprofen) help reduce inflammation in the brain. Inflammation can damage brain cells.\n- **Cholesterol-lowering medications** People who take cholesterol-lowering medications called statins seem to be at significantly lower risk of Alzheimer's disease than other people. The precise effect that elevated cholesterol has on the brain is unknown.\n\n[Stress > Preventing Alzheimer's Disease > *Staying fit as you age*]\nExercise is the best way to stop or reverse age-related loss of muscle, which can make even simple daily activities such as climbing stairs and getting up from a chair hard to do. Strength-building exercises using handheld weights, elastic exercise bands, or weight machines can help you maintain your independence and lower your risk of falls, even into your 90s. Go for frequent walks; walking regularly can significantly lower your risk of having a heart attack or stroke. At least four times a week, do the following exercises at home (for example, while you watch TV). If you're over 50, talk to your doctor before starting an exercise program.\n\n[Stress > Preventing Alzheimer's Disease > *Staying fit as you age* > **Head turn/Neck stretch**]\nSit with your back straight, feet flat on the floor, and head in an upright position.

Regular exercise lessens pain, improves mobility, strengthens surrounding muscle, and increases flexibility. Exercise also improves your overall fitness and helps control your weight, relieving some of the pressure on overtaxed joints.\n\nTo avoid injury, it's important to begin your exercise program slowly. Start with stretching exercises that increase your range of motion and enhance flexibility (see page 8). Then perform strength-conditioning exercises (see page 9).\n\nYou don't have to go to a gym to lift weights—buy some handheld weights to use at home. Add walking, swimming, or bicycling to your routine. Gradually building up your endurance will enable you to exercise longer, and soon you will be stronger and more active and in less pain.\n\nWater exercise is a good choice for people with osteoarthritis because the water supports the body, reducing stress on the hips, knees, and spine. Another good choice is yoga (see page 94), which gently increases joint flexibility as it tones and strengthens\n\nthe surrounding muscles. Other types of exercise that can benefit people with osteoarthritis include t'ai chi and even jogging. Ask your doctor what exercises are best for you.\n\n[Stress > Exercise and Osteoarthritis > Where does osteoarthritis develop most often?]\nOsteoarthritis occurs most often in the joints of the fingers, at the base of the thumbs, and in the neck, lower back, knees, and hips.\n\n![Diagram showing a human figure from the back, illustrating the common sites of osteoarthritis development: the base of the fingers, the base of the thumbs, the neck, the lower back, the knees, and the hips.]()![](_page_71_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n[Stress > Exercise and Osteoarthritis > The Warning Signs of Osteoarthritis]\n- Steady or intermittent joint pain\n- Joint stiffness after getting out of bed or sitting for a long time\n- Swelling in a joint\n- A crunching sound when bone rubs on bone\n\nHot, red, or tender joints are usually a sign of another form of arthritis, called rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n[Stress > Exercise and Osteoarthritis > Exercise is good for your joints]\nRegular physical exercise such as walking is good for people with arthritis. It keeps the joints working as it strengthens the surrounding muscles and ligaments. Exercise can also reduce joint pain, although it can take 4 to 8 weeks of regular exercise before you experience significant pain relief.\n\n![A woman wearing a white sweatshirt and shorts, walking outdoors on a paved path surrounded by grass and trees.]()![](_page_72_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n[Heart Disease]\nYour heart beats steadily 24 hours a day to pump oxygen-rich blood throughout your body. But if the arteries leading to your heart become clogged with a fatty substance called plaque, they become narrowed, reducing the supply of blood to the heart and causing heart disease. If a plaque ruptures, blood clots can form, blocking the artery and causing a heart attack. Heart disease is the No. 1 killer of both men and women in the US, but many women do not realize they are at risk. The good news is that you can reduce your chances of developing heart disease by adopting the heart-healthy lifestyle described here.\n\n[Heart Disease > Risk Factors for Heart Disease]\nSome of the factors that can increase your chances of developing heart disease, such as family history, are not under your control. Many other risk factors, however, can be controlled.\n\n[Heart Disease > Risk Factors for Heart Disease > *Risk factors you cannot control*]\n- **Age** In men, the risk of heart disease increases after age 45; in women, the risk increases after age 55.\n- **Family history** Especially at a young age—a father or brother diagnosed with heart disease before age 55, or a mother or sister diagnosed before age 65.\n- **Race** African Americans have a higher risk of heart disease than people of other races.\n\n[Heart Disease > Risk Factors for Heart Disease > *Risk factors you can control*]\n- **Smoking** Smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease because it raises blood pressure, damages blood vessels, promotes blood clotting, and accelerates plaque formation in artery walls.\n- **High blood pressure** High blood pressure (hypertension) puts extra stress on the heart and blood vessels.\n\n- **Undesirable cholesterol profile** A high total cholesterol level, a low HDL (good) cholesterol level, or a high LDL (bad) cholesterol level can promote plaque formation on artery walls.\n- **Being overweight** Excess weight increases the heart's workload.\n- **Lack of exercise** Regular exercise makes the heart stronger, keeps weight down, improves cholesterol levels, and lowers blood pressure.\n- **Diabetes** Over time, diabetes damages blood vessels and boosts the risk of heart attack and stroke.\n- **Stres", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "exercise", "relation": "benefits", "tail": "joints affected by osteoarthritis"}, {"head": "exercise", "relation": "lessens", "tail": "pain"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

You could feel pain in any of the areas of the body shown here, or you could feel pain in only your arms, jaw, or back. Women's symptoms, especially, can vary considerably from the classic signs of a heart attack. Women are more likely than men to experience dizziness, nausea, sweating, weakness, and faintness along with chest pain.\n\nChest pain that spreads to your neck or jaw\n\n![Diagram showing a person with pain radiating from the chest area (red shading) to the neck and jaw.]()![](_page_76_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\nCrushing pain in your chest that radiates to your left shoulder\n\n![Diagram showing a person with pain radiating from the chest area (red shading) to the left shoulder.]()![](_page_76_Picture_6.jpeg)\n\nDeep, dull pain or a tight, heavy, or squeezing sensation under your breastbone\n\n![Diagram showing a person with a red vertical bar indicating chest pain.]()![](_page_77_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nChest pain that spreads to your back\n\n![Diagram showing a person with a red vertical bar indicating pain radiating to the back.]()![](_page_77_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\n[Heart Disease > Pay Attention to Angina]\nIf too little blood reaches the heart because of narrowed arteries, chest pain (called angina) can develop. Angina can feel like erratic pain or heaviness, tightness, burning, or squeezing in the chest. The pain can be mild and intermittent or more pronounced and steady, and can start in the center of the chest and radiate to the left shoulder, arm, jaw, or lower teeth. Angina often occurs during physical exertion or times of stress. Angina is a sign that you have heart disease and are at risk of having a heart attack.\n\nIf you think you could have angina, tell your doctor right away. Getting prompt treatment for angina can prevent you from having a heart attack. The most common treatment for angina is a drug called nitroglycerin, which reduces the pain by widening the blood vessels to allow more blood to reach the heart.\n\n[Cancer]\nCancer is the second leading cause of death in the US (after heart disease), causing more than half a million deaths each year. One out of two men and one out of three women develop some kind of cancer at some time in their life. Most cancers are diagnosed in people over age 55. Early detection and treatment increase your chances for a cure, so be sure to perform routine self-examinations (see page 137), have all the recommended screening tests (see page 143), and report any suspicious symptoms to your doctor.\n\n[Cancer > What Is Cancer?]\nCancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled multiplication of cells that occurs when genes that control cell division or cell turnover (cell death and replacement) undergo mutations (changes). These genetic mutations are sometimes inherited or present at birth, but usually they result from environmental factors (such as radiation or cigarette smoke) that damage critical regulatory genes.\n\nCell turnover is a tightly balanced process that keeps the body healthy. In normal tissue, old or damaged cells die naturally before they can become cancerous or cause other problems, and are replaced by healthy new cells—a process called apoptosis. In cancer this balance is upset—when damage occurs to either the genes that tell cells when to stop dividing or to the genes that tell old or damaged cells when to die. The resulting increase in the number of cells creates a growing mass of tissue called a tumor. As more and more dividing cells accumulate, the tumor grows and can disrupt the normal functioning of surrounding tissue.\n\nCancer can originate anywhere in the body. Common sites include the lungs, breasts, lymph nodes, colon, bladder, and prostate gland. Cancer can spread through the body in two ways: Cancer cells from a tumor can invade neighboring tissues, and cancer cells from a tumor can penetrate blood vessels or lymphatic vessels, circulate through the bloodstream or lymphatic system, and invade healthy tissue in another part of the body.\n\n[Cancer > What Is Cancer? > What causes cancer?]\nSome people inherit genes that make them susceptible to developing particular types of cancer. Environmental factors that can trigger the changes in genes that lead to cancer\n\ninclude radiation, some chemicals, and some viruses and bacteria. For example, excessive exposure to radiation from sunlight has been linked to skin cancer. More than 60 different chemicals in cigarette smoke are known to cause cancer. The human papillomavirus, which causes the sexually transmitted disease genital warts, is responsible for most cases of cervical cancer in women, and the bacterium *H. pylori* causes many cases of stomach cancer.\n\n![Diagram illustrating factors contributing to cancer risk.

Treatment is more likely to be successful if it is done before cancer cells spread from the original tumor to other parts of the body. Cancer is most often treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy, or a combination of all three. Immunotherapy and stem cell transplants are being used increasingly to treat cancer.\n\n[Cancer > Cancer Treatments > *Surgery*]\nConventional surgery is usually the first treatment recommended by doctors to remove a cancerous tumor and any surrounding tissue that may contain cancer cells. Less invasive surgical procedures are continually being developed that try to preserve as much healthy tissue and normal functioning as possible.\n\n[Cancer > Cancer Treatments > *Surgery* > **Laser surgery**]\nA laser is a highly focused, powerful beam of light that can cut through tissue or vaporize cancers inside the body or on the skin without the need for a large incision. Laser surgery is also sometimes used to relieve symptoms such as breathing or eating problems that can result when large tumors press on the trachea (windpipe) or esophagus.\n\n[Cancer > Cancer Treatments > *Surgery* > **Cryosurgery**]\nCryosurgery uses extreme cold (liquid nitrogen spray or a very cold probe) to freeze and destroy abnormal cells. Cryosurgery is most often used to treat external cancers, such as those on the skin, or precancerous conditions, such as those affecting the cervix. However, doctors are using it increasingly to treat tumors inside the body, including tumors in the prostate gland.\n\n[Cancer > Cancer Treatments > *Surgery* > **Electrosurgery**]\nHigh-frequency electric current is often used to destroy cancers of the skin and mouth. A procedure called LEEP/LLETZ (loop electrosurgical excision procedure or large-loop excision of the transformation zone) is used to remove abnormal tissue from the cervix.\n\n[Cancer > Cancer Treatments > **Mohs surgery**]\nMohs surgery is a technique to remove cancerous tissue by shaving it off one layer at a time. After each layer is removed, it is examined under a microscope to look for cancer cells. When all the cells in a layer look normal under the microscope, surgery is stopped. This technique is used primarily for skin cancers that have recurred or that have developed around sensitive areas such as the eyelids, nose, or lips. Mohs surgery preserves as much healthy tissue as possible and has a high cure rate.\n\n[Cancer > Cancer Treatments > **Experimental forms of cancer surgery**]\nResearchers are investigating other procedures for removing or destroying cancerous tissue using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), microwaves or radio waves, and magnets.\n\n[Cancer > Cancer Treatments > *Immunotherapy*]\nImmunotherapy uses the immune system to fight cancer, either by stimulating a person's immune system (active immunotherapy) or by administering disease-fighting immune system components (such as antibodies) manufactured outside of the body (passive immunotherapy). These techniques, which include cancer vaccines, are currently being studied for treatment of different types of cancer, including melanoma, kidney cancer, blood cancers (such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myelomas), breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, cervical cancer, and ovarian cancer.\n\n[Cancer > Cancer Treatments > *Stem cell transplants and bone marrow transplants*]\nBone marrow is spongy tissue in the center of bones that makes all the blood cells in the body. Blood cells develop from immature cells called stem cells, which are found in the bone marrow and, in smaller amounts, circulating in the blood. If a cancer destroys bone marrow or if bone marrow is damaged from cancer treatment, doctors may\n\nrecommend a stem cell transplant or bone marrow transplant (see page 624) to provide healthy new cells. Stem cell transplants are also used to treat cancers that don't respond to normal doses of chemotherapy. After a person receives high doses of chemotherapy, he or she is given an infusion of stem cells to replace those that were destroyed.\n\n[Cancer > Cancer Treatments > *Radiation therapy*]\nRadiation therapy uses penetrating beams of high-energy radioactive waves or streams of radioactive particles to treat cancer. This radioactive energy, which is the same as that used in X-rays but in much higher doses, kills the cancer cells or keeps them from dividing. Healthy cells are also affected by radiation but, unlike cancer cells, healthy cells tend to recover from the effects of radiation.\n\nMore than half of all people with cancer are treated with some form of radiation. Radiation is often used before surgery to shrink a tumor or after surgery to block the growth of any cancer cells that could remain in the area around the tumor. Radiation therapy is also often combined with chemotherapy (see below).\n\nRadiation therapy can be given either externally or ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "cancer", "relation": "treated by", "tail": "surgery"}, {"head": "cancer", "relation": "treated by", "tail": "radiation therapy"}, {"head": "cancer", "relation": "treated by", "tail": "chemotherapy"}, {"head": "cancer", "relation": "treated by", "tail": "immunotherapy"}, {"head": "cancer", "relation": "treated by", "tail": "stem cell transplants"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctors", "relation": "recommend", "tail": "[Event: conventional surgery]"}, {"head": "patients", "relation": "undergo", "tail": "[Event: surgery]"}, {"head": "cancer cells", "relation": "spread", "tail": "[Event: cancer progression]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: cancer progression]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment]"}, {"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "may lead to", "tail": "[Event: treatment]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Although each of your cells contains exactly the same genes, cells differ from each other because different combinations of genes are switched on and off in each cell. These different gene combinations determine what proteins each cell makes and enable the cell to perform a specialized task.\n\n[Genetics > Chromosomes]\nInside the nucleus of every cell are structures called chromosomes. Chromosomes are long threads of genetic material made up of strands of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). You have 23 pairs of chromosomes; each of your parents contributed one chromosome to every pair. Each chromosome contains from several hundred to several thousand genes. Just before cells divide, the chromosomes make duplicate copies of themselves;\n\nthe two copies of each chromosome are held together at a narrowed region called a centromere, which gives the chromosome an X shape.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the structure of a chromosome.

The two intertwined strands are labeled 'Nucleotide bases'. A segment of the helix is highlighted and labeled 'Gene'. A segment of three nucleotides (a base triplet) is shown, labeled 'Base triplet'.]()![](_page_89_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[Genetics > The genetic code]\nThe information carried by a gene is determined by the structure of its DNA. DNA is arranged in the form of a double helix, or ladder, with rungs supported by a twisting ribbon of sugar and phosphates. The two intertwined DNA strands are linked together by varying patterns of substances called nucleotide bases. There are four nucleotide bases—cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A), and thymine (T).\n\nAlong each helix, or side of the ladder, the bases are arranged in groups of three, called base triplets, to form words of genetic text. For example, base triplets, such as TAC, CGG, and TCA, carry specific amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) to assembly points in a cell where they are strung together to make functioning proteins. To form the rungs of the DNA ladder, the bases can join in only two ways: C joins only with G, and A joins only with T.\n\nIf you think of the nucleotide bases as the letters of the genetic alphabet, then base triplets are the words, genes are the sentences, chromosomes are the chapters, and the genome is each organism's book of life. The human genome contains a total of about 3 billion nucleotide base pairs.\n\n[Genetics > Proteins: Building Blocks of the Body]\nProteins are essential for life. Some proteins make up structures such as muscles and skin; other proteins—including enzymes, antibodies, and many hormones—dissolve in the body's fluids and are carried to wherever they\n\nare needed. Genes control the production of proteins inside cells and provide the instructions for making specific proteins in precisely the right number and at precisely the right time. Different proteins have different functions in the body:\n\n- Enzymes regulate the rate of chemical reactions in cells.\n- Antibodies, produced by the immune system's white blood cells, destroy invading microorganisms and provide protection against infections.\n- Proteins in muscle cells provide mobility, pump blood through the body, and help move food through the digestive tract.\n- Hemoglobin carries oxygen in red blood cells and gives the cells their red color.\n- Hormones control a variety of biological processes, such as growth, sexual development, and the activities of some organs.\n\n![A 3D rendering of a complex protein structure, likely a ribosome or a large molecule, composed of intertwined blue, orange, and green lines against a black background.]()![](_page_90_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\n[Genetics > Proteins: Building Blocks of the Body > *Genetics: The future of medicine*]\nYou will one day be able to learn from your unique genome what disorders you are at increased risk of developing, which will enable you to take steps to prevent them.

The smoke from a cigarette contains more than 4,000 chemicals—at least 60 of them known to cause cancer. Nicotine, the substance in tobacco that makes smoking highly addictive, raises your heart rate, irritates the lining of your blood vessels, and promotes blood clotting, increasing your risk of heart attack and stroke. The carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke reduces the level of oxygen in your blood.\n\nSmoking causes nearly nine out of ten cases of lung cancer—the No. 1 cancer killer of both men and women—and causes other cancers, including cancer of the mouth, throat, esophagus, bladder, kidneys, cervix, and pancreas. Smoking is also responsible for most cases of emphysema and chronic bronchitis and is a major risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death in both men and women. Women over age 35 who both smoke and take birth-control pills increase their risk of having a heart attack or stroke.\n\n[Genetics > The Dangers of Smoking > Why You're Hooked]\nResearchers have discovered why smokers have such a hard time quitting. Normally, your brain releases dopamine (a chemical that produces feelings of pleasure) when you perform a rewarding behavior, such as eating when you are hungry. The brain then quickly releases another chemical, called acetylcholine, which stops the release of dopamine.\n\nWhen you smoke, nicotine triggers the release of dopamine but prevents the brain from turning it off by blocking the release of acetylcholine. As a result, the brain continues pumping out dopamine, making you feel better and better. After nicotine levels in the bloodstream fall, dopamine production declines. The brain, recalling the good feelings, wants more, producing cravings for another cigarette. These processes take place inside a part of your brain that scientists call the reward center.\n\n[Genetics > The Dangers of Smoking > Why You're Hooked > The brain's reward center]\nTwo structures—the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area—deep in the brain's reward center are responsible for the release of dopamine, which produces feelings of pleasure.\n\n![Diagram of the brain showing the Nucleus accumbens and Ventral tegmental area, located deep in the brain's reward center.]()![](_page_95_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n[Genetics > The Dangers of Smoking > When the brain's reward center works normally]\n- **ON:** The reward center releases dopamine to reward a good behavior, such as learning a new skill (green arrows).\n- **OFF:** Minutes later, another brain chemical, acetylcholine, shuts dopamine production off (red arrows).\n\n![Diagram illustrating the reward center releasing dopamine (green arrows) and acetylcholine (red arrows) shutting off dopamine production.]()![](_page_95_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\n[Genetics > The Dangers of Smoking > When nicotine interferes with the reward center]\n- **ON:** Nicotine in the bloodstream causes the reward center to release a flood of dopamine (green arrows).\n- **NOT OFF:** Nicotine blocks the release of acetylcholine, so the\n\nreward center keeps releasing dopamine until blood levels of nicotine fall, producing craving for more nicotine (red arrows).\n\n![Diagram illustrating the reward center mechanism.

A red prohibition sign (no entry) is shown below the center, suggesting a negative consequence or addiction cycle.]()![](_page_96_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n[Genetics > Deaths from cigarette smoking]\nThis chart uses figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to show the number and causes of deaths attributed to smoking each year in the US. Of the nearly half a million smoking-related deaths, 7 out of 10 result from lung disease, especially lung cancer and emphysema, and from heart disease and stroke.\n\n![Pie chart showing the causes of smoking-related deaths in the US. The largest category is Lung cancer (124,813). Other major categories include Chronic lung disease (82,431), Heart disease (81,976), and Stroke (17,445). Smaller categories include Other cancers (30,948), Other disorders (66,732), and Secondhand smoke (38,053).]()![](_page_96_Figure_4.jpeg)\n\n[Genetics > How Smoking Affects the Lungs]\nSmoking is the major cause of lung cancer and emphysema (a chronic lung condition in which damage to the tiny air sacs in the lungs makes breathing\n\ndifficult). Chronic inflammation of lung tissue from cigarette smoke and tar residue left by the smoke triggers a cascade of changes in cells in the lungs that can lead to cancer, emphysema, or both. In this cross section of a lung with cancer (top), the white area in the upper lobe is cancerous tissue, and the blackened areas are deposits of tar.

But try to get back on track quickly. Most people relapse several times before they quit for good. If you have a cigarette:\n\n- **Don't be discouraged.** Quitting smoking is difficult—a relapse doesn't mean you can't succeed.\n- **Learn from your experience.** Figure out what triggered your urge to light up and try to avoid it.\n\n[Genetics > If You Relapse > Secondhand Smoke]\nSecondhand smoke (also called passive smoking) is a combination of the smoke given off by cigarettes and the smoke exhaled by smokers. Secondhand smoke is classified as a cancer-causing agent and is responsible for about 35,000 deaths from heart disease and 3,000 deaths from lung cancer each year, primarily among nonsmoking spouses of smokers. Every year, nearly 300,000 cases of bronchitis and pneumonia in children under 18 months of age are directly linked to secondhand smoke, which is also responsible for triggering or worsening hundreds of thousands of cases of childhood asthma. Also, children who regularly breathe secondhand smoke are more likely than other children to have frequent ear infections and more dental cavities.\n\n[Genetics > If You Relapse > Medical Treatments for Quitting]\nFor smokers who are highly addicted, many doctors recommend nicotine-replacement products. These products—such as nicotine gum, pills, and patches (available over the counter) and inhalers and nasal sprays (available only by prescription)—release small amounts of nicotine into the bloodstream to relieve withdrawal symptoms from nicotine and help reduce cravings for cigarettes. These products provide safer doses of nicotine than cigarettes—the nicotine enters the body less rapidly and in a lower concentration and does not have the thousands of harmful chemicals present in cigarette smoke. Over a period of about 6 to 12 weeks, the dose of nicotine is gradually reduced to slowly lower your craving.\n\nThe prescription antidepressant medication bupropion is another proven treatment for helping people quit smoking. Bupropion, taken in pills, acts in the brain, probably by blocking nicotine receptors, preventing them from\n\ntriggering the release of the feel-good chemical dopamine (which produces the nicotine addiction). Bupropion seems to be most effective for smoking cessation in women and in people who have a history of depression. The drug can be taken along with nicotine replacement products. Together, the two treatments boost the chances of success.\n\n[Terrorism]\nFor the average American, the risk of experiencing a terrorist attack firsthand is low. However, despite the low risk, you still may feel worried and frightened during a national security alert. One positive way to cope with your anxiety and fear is to talk about your feelings with family and friends. You will find that most people share your concerns and many will appreciate the opportunity to talk about them. If you continue to feel anxious or depressed or if you are unable to focus on your usual activities, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional. You can also take constructive steps to prepare for a possible terrorist attack (see below), which can help you feel more in control.\n\nThe federal government has identified a number of possible terrorist threats and has developed a national emergency response system to coordinate local and state emergency programs throughout the country in the event of terrorist attacks. Types of attacks that could occur involve biological agents (such as bacteria and viruses), chemicals, or radioactive materials.\n\n[Terrorism > How to Prepare for a Terrorist Attack]\nIf a terrorist attack occurs, your local emergency response system will activate and local public health authorities will tell you what to do. Listen to news broadcasts to monitor the situation. Follow instructions from your local police and fire departments and from emergency workers on the scene. Although there is no way to predict exactly what might happen during a terrorist attack, there are a number of things you can do to prepare for an attack:\n\n- **Assemble emergency supplies.** Have enough bottled water (1 gallon of water per person per day) and nonperishable foods (such as canned goods, nuts, dried fruit, and boxes of dry cereal) for at least 3 days. Include a first-aid kit, extra eyeglasses and medication, vitamin and mineral supplements, tools, a battery-powered radio, a flashlight, extra batteries, a manual can opener, toilet paper, paper towels, moist towelettes, bleach, soap, and bedding and a change of clothing for each person. If you can, store extra water in containers for washing. If there is a baby in the house, include\n\nready-to-feed formula, baby food, and disposable diapers. Make a list of emergency phone numbers such as the local fire department and police department, a local hospital, and your doctor.\n\n**Develop ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "cigarette", "relation": "triggers", "tail": "urge"}, {"head": "secondhand smoke", "relation": "causes", "tail": "deaths from heart disease"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

Chemical agents can be released in bombs, sprayed from planes or boats, or discharged from a canister in an enclosed area (such as a building or the subway). A chemical agent can poison people directly or contaminate the environment. Most chemical agents cause symptoms immediately but some can take several hours or even days to have an effect. Symptoms depend on the type of chemical agent used. Chemical agents are classified into the following general categories based on how they affect the body:\n\n- Damage the respiratory system, especially the lungs (phosgene or chlorine)\n- Interfere with the body's use of oxygen (cyanide)\n- Affect the nervous system (sarin, malath", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "antibiotics", "relation": "treats", "tail": "Tularemia"}, {"head": "vaccine", "relation": "is not available for", "tail": "the general public"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "Francisella tularensis", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: symptoms develop]"}, {"head": "person", "relation": "experiences", "tail": "[Event: sudden fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, dry cough, weakness, severe difficulty breathing, or pneumonia]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: symptoms develop]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment]"}, {"head": "[Event: release as an aerosol in an enclosed space or over a city]", "relation": "can cause", "tail": "[Event: Tularemia outbreak]"}]}, "status": "success"}

In generations past, the health benefits of regular exercise and the dangers of harmful habits such as smoking were largely unknown. Little was known about the importance of vitamins, antioxidants, fiber, or other nutrients, or the adverse effects of eating too much saturated fat. Today a wealth of information has enabled us to choose health-promoting lifestyle habits that can help us stay fit and live longer.\n\nIn this part, you will learn the basics of nutrition and how a healthful diet can help you to lower your risk of heart disease—the No. 1 killer of both men and women in the United States—as well as many of the other common chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and some cancers. The critical link between exercise and health, and how to use physical activity to maintain a sensible weight, are also explored. This part also describes ways to reduce stress and avoid harmful behaviors such as smoking and abusing alcohol or other drugs. Information on safety and preventing violence can help you protect your family both at home and when you're away. Other helpful topics discussed here include preventive health care and alternative medicine.\n\n[Terrorism > Diet and Health]\nAn unhealthy diet is a major factor contributing to the epidemics of obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer. However, diet is one of the most controllable risk factors. You can reduce your risk of developing many chronic diseases by choosing nutritious foods more often and limiting your intake of calories, fat, salt, and sugar. A healthy diet also can help you keep your weight down and your energy levels up. But what constitutes a healthy diet? Nutrition experts agree that you can reduce your risk of many diseases by consuming a diet that contains plenty of fiber-rich vegetables and fruits, an abundance of whole grains, and low-fat sources of dairy, animal, and vegetable protein. This chapter teaches you the basics of good nutrition, explains how nutritional needs change as you get older, and shows you how to improve your diet to prevent disease.\n\n[Terrorism > Eating for Good Health]\nHow do you choose nutritious foods to help your family maintain good health? Most doctors agree that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (see page 37) offer good general guidelines for healthy people. You can tailor these guidelines to meet your individual needs by working with your doctor to identify your personal health risks. As part of a thorough physical examination, your doctor will check your weight, your blood pressure, your cholesterol levels, and your blood glucose (sugar) levels. He or she will ask about your family's health history (see page 131), and calculate your body mass index (BMI; see page 11) and your waist-to-hip ratio to see how fat is distributed on your body. Using this information, you and your doctor can work together to adjust your diet to reduce your risk of disease.\n\nIf you have a high cholesterol level and a family history of heart disease, your doctor will probably suggest that you avoid or limit foods high in saturated fat and trans fats (see page 38), exercise regularly, and maintain a healthy weight. If you have a family history of diabetes or are overweight, your doctor will recommend increasing your physical activity and losing weight. If you have a family history of colon cancer or some other cancers, your doctor will recommend reducing your consumption of fat\n\n(especially animal fat), increasing your consumption of fiber-rich foods, and increasing your level of physical activity. Depending on your risk factors and your age and gender, the doctor will also tell you what screening tests you need regularly.\n\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend a diet that is low in fat (especially saturated fat and trans fats) and high in fiber-rich whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. Children under age 2 need breast milk or higher-fat dairy or soy milk or formula to ensure proper brain development. But, after age 2, they should make the transition to low-fat foods. Try to eat at least five half-cup servings of vegetables and fruits and six half-cup servings of grain products and legumes each day. It also is important to eat a wide variety of foods to make sure you are consuming as many essential nutrients as possible. When applying healthy eating principles, consider your diet over several days, but choose wisely meal by meal. Choose low-fat, high-fiber foods more often and use low-fat cooking methods such as broiling and grilling instead of frying.\n\nYou don't have to eliminate your favorite high-fat snacks, desserts, or fast foods altogether. If you occasionally indulge in pizza, a burger, or a dish of ice cream, enjoy it.

These guidelines show you how to get the nutrients you need to lead a healthier, more active life and to lower your risk for the most common chronic diseases, including heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure, and diabetes. To maintain optimum health:\n\n- Aim for a healthy weight.\n- Be physically active every day.\n- Eat a variety of grains daily, especially whole grains.\n- Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables daily.\n- Store food properly.\n- Eat a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol and moderate in total fat.\n- Choose beverages and foods that are low in sugar.\n- Choose and prepare foods with less salt.\n- If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation.\n\n[Terrorism > USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans > *Carbohydrates*]\nCarbohydrates are the main source of fuel for your body and should make up 45 to 65 percent of your daily calorie intake. Carbohydrates contribute sugar, starches, and fiber from plant foods and come in two forms—simple and complex. Your body absorbs simple carbohydrates—such as those in table sugar, most fruits, and the sugar in milk (lactose)—very quickly. Complex carbohydrates are absorbed more gradually and provide your body with a more constant supply of energy. Complex carbohydrates also help stabilize blood glucose levels, avoiding the up-and-down swings in glucose that can result from eating simple carbohydrates. For these reasons, most of the carbohydrates you eat should be complex carbohydrates from whole grains, vegetables, and whole fruits (including the skins).\n\nChildren and adults should consume about 130 grams of carbohydrates every day, which is the minimum amount necessary to get a sufficient amount of glucose to enable the brain to function properly. Most people get much more than this. Sources of added sugars are everywhere in the American food supply and in all food groups. Some\n\nobvious sources are candy, soft drinks, fruit drinks, pastries, and other sweets. Some not-so-obvious sources are salad dressings, cereals, ketchup, and breads. People who eat too many added sugars often take in too many calories and fewer of the essential nutrients than they need. Try to limit your intake of foods and beverages that have added sugars.\n\n[Terrorism > USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans > *Fiber*]\nFiber, a substance in the cell walls of plants, is an especially important component of complex carbohydrates because it helps lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and reduces your risk of heart disease. Fiber can help you maintain a healthy weight. It also may help lower your risk of colon cancer and other digestive tract disorders such as diverticulosis (see page 772). Dietary fiber occurs in two forms—soluble and insoluble. Neither type is digestible, but they both serve important functions in your diet. Soluble fiber—found naturally in oats, barley, dried beans and peas (legumes), and some fruits—is the type that improves cholesterol. A grass called psyllium, which is added to some cereals and breads and is used in some over-the-counter stool softeners and laxatives, has also been shown to help lower blood cholesterol. Insoluble fiber—contained in whole-wheat bread, wheat bran, and fruit and vegetable skins—provides bulk to stool, helping it pass more easily through the digestive system. For this reason, insoluble fiber, along with plenty of fluid, helps prevent constipation.\n\n[Terrorism > USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans > *Fiber* > Good Sources of Fiber]\n| Food                | Serving Size | Total Fiber (Grams) |\n|---------------------|--------------|---------------------|\n| Legumes (Cooked)    |              |                     |\n| Pinto beans         | 1 cup        | 15                  |\n| Navy beans          | 1 cup        | 13                  |\n| Kidney beans        | 1 cup        | 11                  |\n| Chickpeas           | 1 cup        | 9                   |\n| Vegetables (Cooked) |              |                     |\n\n| Artichoke                  | 1 medium     | 7   |\n|----------------------------|--------------|-----|\n| Green peas                 | 1 cup        | 6   |\n| Sweet potato               | 1 medium     | 4   |\n| Corn                       | 1 medium ear | 2.5 |\n| Fruits                     |              |     |\n| Raspberries                | 1 cup        | 8   |\n| Blueberries                | 1 cup        | 6   |\n| Apple with skin            | 1 medium     | 4   |\n| Orange                     | 1 medium     | 3   |\n| Whole Grains               |              |     |\n| Packaged wheat-bran cereal | 1 cup        | 8   |\n| Whole-grain bread          | 2 slices     | 4   |\n| Oatmeal (cooked)           | 1 cup        | 4   |\n| Whole-wheat pasta (cooked) | 1 cup        | 4   |\n\nThe recommended dai", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "saturated fat", "relation": "low in", "tail": "diet"}, {"head": "cholesterol", "relation": "low in", "tail": "diet"}, {"head": "total fat", "relation": "moderate in", "tail": "diet"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "patient", "relation": "participate in", "tail": "[Event: clinical trial]"}, {"head": "you", "relation": "lead to", "tail": "[Event: lower risk for chronic diseases]"}, {"head": "you", "relation": "get", "tail": "[Event: nutrients needed]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: heart disease]", "relation": "cause of", "tail": "[Event: high blood pressure]"}, {"head": "[Event: cancer]", "relation": "cause of", "tail": "[Event: high blood pressure]"}, {"head": "[Event: diabetes]", "relation": "cause of", "tail": "[Event: high blood pressure]"}]}, "status": "success"}

(Infants and young children need a larger proportion of fat—25 to 40 percent of total daily calories.) Also, choose your fats wisely. As few of your calories as possible (less than 5 to 10 percent of total calories) should come from saturated fat and trans fats. Trans fats are found in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, which are used in many margarines and shortenings to make liquid oils hard at room temperature. Trans fats may be even more harmful to the heart than saturated fats.\n\nTrans fats are often used in packaged baked goods such as cakes, cookies, crackers, and pie crusts; in snacks such as potato chips; and in some dairy products, meats, restaurant fried foods, and fast foods. Consume as little of these fats as possible. Read food labels to find the amounts of trans fats in foods. Take the following steps to limit your consumption of these harmful fats:\n\n- When buying processed foods, read the ingredient list and avoid those that list trans fats or hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils. Look for foods that contain unhydrogenated oils.\n\n- Use naturally occurring unhydrogenated oils such as canola or olive oil.\n- Choose the soft or liquid margarines sold in tubs or squeeze bottles instead of stick margarines or butter. Look for soft margarines with vegetable oil listed as the first ingredient and that contain no more than 2 grams of saturated fat per tablespoon.

Your blood contains lipo (fat) proteins that influence your risk of heart disease. One lipoprotein, called HDL cholesterol, is good for the heart. Another lipoprotein, called LDL cholesterol, can be harmful to the heart and can increase your risk of heart attack.\n\nBlood cholesterol is a gummy substance your liver makes to help manufacture hormones and bile (a fluid that aids digestion). The liver makes most of the cholesterol from saturated fats that you consume in foods such as meats, baked goods, and full-fat dairy products. A smaller amount of cholesterol is absorbed into the bloodstream directly from cholesterol-containing foods such as egg yolks. The amount of cholesterol in your blood is determined not only by your diet, but also by hereditary factors. Some people inherit a susceptibility to elevated blood cholesterol.\n\n[Terrorism > Dietary Fat > Comparing Types of Fat]\n| Types of Fat         | Major Food Sources                                | Effects on Blood Cholesterol              |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Monounsaturated fats | Olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil, nuts, avocados | Lower LDL (bad) and total cholesterol and |\n\n| Polyunsaturated fats | Corn oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, flaxseed oil, soybean oil, cottonseed oil, fish                                                           | raise HDL (good) cholesterol<br>Lower total cholesterol and can lower HDL (good) cholesterol |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Omega-3 fatty acids  | Fatty, cold-water fish such as salmon, mackerel, and tuna                                                                                         | Lower total cholesterol, lower LDL (bad) cholesterol, and raise HDL (good) cholesterol       |\n| Plant sterols        | Some tub margarines and salad dressings                                                                                                           | Lower total cholesterol and lower LDL (bad) cholesterol                                      |\n| Saturated fats       | Fatty red meat, dark meat of poultry, whole and 2% dairy products, butter, chocolate, coconut oil, palm oil                                       | Increase total cholesterol and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol                                |\n| Trans fats           | Most stick margarines, vegetable shortening, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, deep-fried chips, many fast foods, most commercial baked goods | Increase total cholesterol and LDL (bad) cholesterol and may lower HDL (good) cholesterol    |\n| Dietary cholesterol  | Egg yolks, shrimp, liver, full-fat dairy products                                                                                                 | Raises total cholesterol (but not as much as saturated fats and trans fats do)               |\n\n[Terrorism > *Vitamins and Minerals*]\nVitamins are chemicals in food that your body needs to function normally. Minerals are elements absorbed by plant foods that are essential for your body in very small amounts. With the exception of vitamin D, your body cannot make vitamins or minerals, so you need to get them from the foods you eat. Some people can get sufficient amounts of vitamins and minerals from their diet, but many of us need to take a multivitamin/mineral supplement to ensure that we get all of the essential nutrients. Although food is the best source of nutrients, most doctors now recommend that most people take a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement.\n\nWhile taking a daily multivitamin can be beneficial, it should not take the place of a healthy diet. Foods supply many nutrients—such as fiber, essential fatty acids, and antioxidants and phytochemicals—that are not present in supplements. Avoid taking massive doses of specific vitamins or minerals, which can be harmful and can increase or reduce your body's absorption of other vitamins and minerals. For example, fat-soluble vitamins such as A and D (which are not eliminated in urine, as are the water-soluble vitamins) can cause serious health problems. Unless you are a menstruating woman or you have been diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia (see page 610), take a multivitamin that does not contain iron or that has no more than 15 milligrams of iron. Excess levels of iron are linked to an increased risk of heart disease.\n\n[Terrorism > *Vitamins and Minerals* > **Some Foods That Pack Lots of Nutrients**]\nNutrition experts recommend consuming a varied diet to make sure you meet all of your nutritional needs.

It does not provide energy or calories but, like fiber, it plays a critical role in the body's ability to function normally. Water helps your body distribute nutrients to cells, regulate body temperature, and eliminate waste. Drink six to eight glasses of water each day—more if you consume drinks that contain caffeine or alcohol, both of which increase water loss from the body. Vigorous exercise and hot, humid weather can rapidly use up your body's supply of fluid and increase your need for water, but they are not the only dehydrating factors. Living in a dry climate and dry, indoor heating in the winter can also increase the risk of dehydration and boost your water requirements.\n\nFluoridated water helps prevent tooth decay. Some parts of the United States have water supplies with naturally occurring fluoride; in others, municipalities add the mineral to the water supply. Many people drink bottled water because they think it's safer. However, most bottled waters do not contain fluoride or naturally occurring minerals. Some supplemented bottled waters contain various nutrients, but they can be expensive and may not be as healthy as water from the tap.\n\nThe US government regulates the safety of American drinking water through established standards for water purity. Most public water supplies meet these standards. However, if water treatment systems break down, bacteria and other contaminants can reach unsafe levels. In these situations, local officials usually advise residents to boil their tap water before drinking it or using it for cooking. Lead that leaches from plumbing pipes, solder, or well pumps also can contaminate tap water, especially in older homes. To minimize the level of lead in the tap water in your home, run the cold water for 3 or 4 minutes the first time you use it each day. Always cook with cold tap water instead of hot tap water because hot water pulls lead out of pipes more easily.", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Water", "relation": "helps", "tail": "body"}, {"head": "Water", "relation": "regulate", "tail": "body temperature"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

Vegetarians are less likely than meat eaters to develop heart disease, high blood pressure, and some cancers, or to be overweight. But vegetarians can risk developing iron deficiency anemia (see page 610) or being malnourished if they are not knowledgeable about appropriate food choices.\n\nThere are three types of vegetarian diets—ovolactovegetarian, lactovegetarian, and vegan. Ovolactovegetarians consume eggs and dairy products along with plant foods. Lactovegetarians eat dairy products but not eggs. Vegans eat only plant foods and, for this reason, are most at risk for vitamin and mineral deficiencies; however, a vegan diet can be very healthy when plant-based foods are combined. A vegetarian diet for children and pregnant women must be planned very carefully to ensure that they consume sufficient calories, calcium, protein, and essential nutrients to meet all their vitamin, mineral, and amino acid (protein) needs.\n\nIf you're not ready to be a full-time vegetarian, at least try eating a few vegetarian meals every week. Occasionally having pasta with a meatless sauce, bean or avocado burritos, or mushroom barley soup for lunch or dinner along with salads and fruits will vary your menu, save money, and provide huge health benefits.\n\n[Terrorism > *Vitamins and Minerals* > *Nutritional Needs Change Throughout Life*]\nTo a large extent, your age determines your nutritional needs. Newborns and infants have special nutritional needs that are best met by breastfeeding (see page 539).\n\nDoctors recommend that mothers breastfeed their babies for the first 12 months of life. Breast milk supplies better nutrition than commercial formula, promotes healthy brain development, and provides infection-fighting antibodies from the mother. Also, infants should not be given cow's milk until they are 1 year old because it can cause an allergic reaction and is too concentrated for an infant's digestive system.\n\n[Terrorism > Food Sensitivities]\nA food sensitivity is a reaction to an additive or ingredient in a food, but the reaction is not related to the immune system. Sulfites, substances that occur naturally in the fermentation of wine and are used as preservatives on fresh fruits and vegetables, are common additives that cause food sensitivity. Sulfites can trigger severe asthmalike symptoms such as shortness of breath and chest tightness. In the United States, foods and wine that contain sulfites must indicate it on their label. Flavor enhancers (such as monosodium glutamate) and food coloring (mainly yellow dye No. 5) can cause adverse reactions such as headaches. Sometimes a naturally occurring substance called histamine can cause a reaction known as histamine toxicity, which mimics an allergic reaction. Cheese, some wines, and tuna and mackerel sometimes contain large amounts of histamine.\n\nDifferent people can have different reactions to the same foods. If you think you could be having problems with a particular food, see your doctor; he or she can help you identify the foods that trigger a reaction so you can avoid them.\n\nToddlers and preschoolers sometimes become picky eaters as their newfound independence propels them into a multitude of activities that seem much more interesting than eating. Start to teach good nutrition habits at this age. Offer your child a variety of foods without forcing him or her to eat any particular food. When deciding how much food to give your child, use this convenient rule of thumb: about 1 tablespoon of each food per meal for every year of age. For example, a typical dinner for a 5-year-old might be 5 tablespoons of chicken along with 5 tablespoons of a vegetable and 5 tablespoons of brown rice.\n\nAs your child enters school, he or she will still need lots of calories to fuel growth. However, the number of children in America who are overweight or obese is skyrocketing. Being overweight as a child can lead to health problems such as heart\n\ndisease and diabetes—and Americans are developing these diseases at younger and younger ages. Limit your child's intake of high-calorie, high-fat snacks, and encourage him or her to be physically active. In general, being physically active is a better solution for an overweight child than a diet that drastically cuts calories because of the risk of developing an eating disorder (see page 725) or of getting insufficient amounts of essential nutrients.\n\nThe accelerated body changes that occur during adolescence are sustained by good nutrition.

Regular exercise provides many health benefits, including a reduced risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, some cancers, and most of the other common chronic diseases that can affect us as we age. The sedentary lifestyle of increasing numbers of Americans is a serious public health problem in this country. Even if you have been sedentary for years, it's never too late to gain health benefits from exercise.\n\n[Terrorism > Exercise, Fitness, and Health > The Health Benefits of Physical Activity]\nThe human body is designed for movement. We inherited the same efficient mechanisms our primitive ancestors needed for hunting food, traveling long distances on foot, and building shelter. Today, however, most of us drive our cars to the grocery store and sit in offices or classrooms for a large part of the day. Our lack of exercise triggers the processes that lead to common chronic diseases, including osteoporosis, heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. Physical activity can help prevent these debilitating chronic diseases and keep you healthy in the following ways:\n\n- Increases the efficiency of your heart and lungs.\n- Raises the level of helpful HDL cholesterol and lowers the level of harmful LDL cholesterol in your blood.\n- Helps you control your weight.\n- Improves sleep.\n- Reduces stress, improves your mood, and lowers your risk of depression.\n- Boosts the strength and tone of your muscles.\n- Builds strong bones.\n- Increases the flexibility of your joints.\n- Improves your self-image.\n- Increases your energy level and endurance.\n- Improves your posture.\n- Slows the aging process.\n\n- Improves your quality of life as you age.\n\nExercise also has beneficial effects on the brain. Physical exercise seems to stimulate the growth of brain cells, especially in an area of the brain called the hippocampus, which plays an important role in memory and learning. Physical activity also may improve the brain's defenses against infection.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine has established exercise guidelines that set a goal of 1 hour a day of activity, including both low-intensity activities of daily life (such as walking or housecleaning) and more vigorous exercise (such as jogging, swimming, or cycling). If your job is sedentary, you can achieve this goal by, for example, walking at a pace of 4 miles per hour for a total of 60 minutes every day, or by engaging in a high-intensity activity such as jogging for 20 to 30 minutes 4 to 7 days a week. These guidelines are recommended for all children over age 6 and for all adults.\n\nIf you have been largely sedentary and start on a moderate exercise program, you can cut your risk of premature death in half. Spread short exercise sessions throughout your day, as long as the total adds up to about 60 minutes. For example, walk your dog briskly for 20 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes more at night. Add a 20-minute walk and a 10-minute stair-climbing session during your lunch hour and you've met your goal.\n\nAll types of physical activity are good for you and will lower your risk of heart disease and other illnesses as long as you do them regularly. Of course, the more exercise you do, and the more vigorous, the greater the health benefits. Increase your activity level gradually by adding more vigorous exercises, such as jogging or swimming, to your walking regimen.\n\nPeople tend to become less active as they get older, but the need for physical activity does not diminish with age. In fact, you will see positive results even if you don't start exercising until you are older. Previously sedentary people who begin exercising in their 50s, 60s, or older can significantly reduce their risk of dying of a heart attack, even if they already have a heart condition. Exercise also increases the flexibility of your joints and the strength of your muscles, reducing your risk of fractures and enabling you to stay active and independent as you age.\n\nIncorporate more physical activity into your daily routine. Get off the bus a stop or two early and walk the rest of the way to work. Use the stairs instead of the elevator whenever you can. Go for bike rides with your children, and take family walks after dinner. Do your own yard work and gardening. In bad weather, walk around the local shopping mall a few times. On weekends, plan active outings such as hiking, skiing, or ice-skating instead of going to the movies. Ride a stationary bike or use hand weights while you watch TV. Take the family on a hiking or biking vacation.\n\n[Terrorism > WARNING! > When to Stop Exercising]\nAlthough exercise provides numerous health benefits, it is important to know when to stop.

Let's say that you're 40 years old. First, subtract your age from 220 ( $220 - 40 = 180$ ). The resulting number (180 beats per minute) is your maximum target heart rate. To find your target heart rate range, multiply that number by 50 percent to find the low end and 80 percent to find the high end ( $180 \\times 0.50 = 90$  and  $180 \\times 0.80 = 144$ ). Your target heart rate range is 90 to 144 beats per minute.\n\nThe easiest way to check your heart rate is to count your heartbeats for 6 seconds right after an exercise session and multiply that number by 10 to find the number of heart beats in a minute. To count your heartbeats, place the tips of your middle and index fingers (don't use your thumb) on your throat to one side of your Adam's apple or on the inside of your wrist. As soon as you feel your pulse, start counting the beats for 6 seconds. Multiply the number of beats by 10. If your rate is below or above your target heart rate range, adjust your exercise by making it more or less strenuous.\n\n[Terrorism > Finding Your Target Heart Rate > Taking your pulse]\nTo take your pulse, place the tips of your middle and index fingers (not your thumb) on your throat to one side of your Adam's apple (top) or on the inside of your wrist (bottom).

As you get older, you lose up to half a pound of muscle every year, and the muscle is replaced by fat. This process translates into a 1 to 2 percent loss of strength each year. Over time, the loss in strength can reduce your ability to move, ultimately resulting in a loss of physical independence in old age. Performing strengthening exercises regularly two or three times a week does the following:\n\n- Improves your balance, reducing falls.\n\n- Strengthens your bones, reducing your risk of osteoporosis and fractures.\n- Boosts your metabolism (the chemical processes that take place in your body), increasing the rate at which you burn calories.\n- Relieves pain from arthritis.\n- Improves your state of mind.\n- Strengthens your heart.\n- Helps you sleep better.\n- Improves the quality of your life.\n\nEven if you don't start until your 80s or 90s, strength conditioning will help you perform daily tasks—such as lifting grocery bags or getting up from a chair—that can get more difficult as you get older. A small change in muscle size can make a big difference in strength, which can help you remain independent.\n\nKeep in mind that if you stop doing aerobic exercise for more than 2 weeks or so, you will start to lose some of the health benefits you have gained. To stay at your more fit level, stick with your aerobic exercise program. Vary your workouts so you won't get bored. Jog or walk briskly a few times each week, swim for a couple of days, and then use a stationary bike or rowing machine for the remaining days of the week. Do an aerobics routine with a video. Think of ways to modify your routine to keep you motivated.\n\n[Terrorism > Staying Strong as You Age > *Strength-Conditioning Exercise*]\nStrength-conditioning exercises make you fit by building muscle strength and can be as beneficial for your heart as aerobic exercise. Weight training (using free weights or weight machines) is an efficient way to strengthen your muscles. However, doing sit-ups, push-ups, pull-ups, lunges, and leg lifts can accomplish the same goal. Strength-conditioning exercises are sometimes referred to as resistance exercises because they force your muscles to work against, or resist, an object such as a 10-pound weight or the weight of your body.\n\nYou don't have to buy any special equipment to build muscle. Lift soup cans or books. Of course, you can buy inexpensive hand and ankle weights or a resistance band at your local sporting-goods store to use at home. Joining a health club will give you access to a variety of weight machines that can condition all of your muscle groups.\n\nIf you work out with weights or a weight machine, start with the heaviest weight you can manage to perform 8 to 15 repetitions without stopping. You may have to begin with weights as light as 1 or 2 pounds. Starting with weights that are too heavy can injure your muscles. Exhale as you lift or push the weight, and inhale as you relax.

Being overweight increases your risk of developing a number of common chronic illnesses, including heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer. Overweight children are developing these disorders at younger and younger ages.\n\nObesity is a complicated chronic disorder caused by a combination of inherited, physical, behavioral, socioeconomic, and cultural factors. People seem to inherit a preset weight range below which it is difficult to stay. While it is possible to keep your weight down near the lower end of your inherited weight range, it would be difficult to stay below it permanently.\n\n[Terrorism > Are You Overweight?]\nDetermining if you are at a healthy weight involves the number of pounds you weigh and the percentage of your body that is made up of fat. The way in which fat is distributed on your body—around your waist or around your hips—can also influence your health risks. Women naturally have more body fat than men, especially around the hips and thighs. There is no easy way to measure the amount of fat on your body, but in general, the more active you are, the less your percentage of body fat is likely to be. To find your healthy weight, check the body mass index (BMI) chart on page 11.\n\n[Terrorism > The Risks of Being Overweight]\nBeing overweight is a major risk factor for a number of chronic disorders. Where on your body you carry excess weight can also influence your risk of health problems. People who tend to accumulate fat around their waistline are at greater risk of disorders such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke than are people who tend to accumulate fat around their hips and thighs. Women are at\n\nincreased risk of health problems if their waistline is larger than 35 inches; men if their waistline is larger than 40 inches. Your risk of health problems increases if your BMI (see page 11) is 25 or greater.\n\nIf you already have a health problem associated with being overweight, losing weight will probably help you control it. Even a 10 percent reduction in body weight has health benefits. For some disorders, such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, weight loss can help reduce or even eliminate the need for medication. Even if you are overweight, if you exercise regularly, you can still gain benefits from physical activity, such as a reduced risk of heart disease.\n\n[Terrorism > The Risks of Being Overweight > *Heart Disease*]\nBeing overweight is a major risk factor for heart disease. Although not all the mechanisms involved are known, several factors link obesity to heart disease:\n\n- Being overweight increases the level of total cholesterol and other fats called triglycerides in the blood, which can cause fatty deposits to build up in artery walls.\n- Being overweight lowers the blood level of HDL (good) cholesterol, which keeps blood vessels healthy.\n- Being overweight increases the risk of diabetes, which increases the risk of having a heart attack.\n\n[Terrorism > The Risks of Being Overweight > *High Blood Pressure*]\nBeing overweight is the No. 1 factor contributing to high blood pressure. In a large percentage of people who have high blood pressure, losing even a modest amount of weight—just 10 pounds—can often bring blood pressure down to a healthy level. Blood pressure readings go down within the first 2 or 3 weeks of weight loss. The percentage of a person's weight that is made up of fat seems to affect blood pressure more than does total body weight. For this reason, strengthening exercises (see page 9) such as weight lifting, push-ups, and leg lifts, which build muscle and reduce body fat, can help keep blood pressure down.\n\n[Terrorism > The Risks of Being Overweight > *Type 2 Diabetes*]\nMore than 16 million Americans have type 2 diabetes, and about a third of them don't know it because the disorder causes no symptoms in the early stages. Type 2 diabetes tends to run in families, but being overweight is a stronger risk factor than heredity. This means that even if you have a family history of diabetes, you can prevent it or delay it by keeping your weight within a healthy range and getting plenty of exercise. Long-term effects of diabetes include blindness, kidney disease, and poor circulation (which frequently results in amputation of lower limbs). People with diabetes also have an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure.\n\n[Terrorism > The Risks of Being Overweight > *Cancer*]\nBeing overweight appears to increase a person's chances of developing some types of cancer, including cancer of the gallbladder, colon, prostate, uterus, kidney, ovary, and breast.

Losing weight is difficult, and going off of a diet is common, especially during holidays and on other special occasions. Successful weight loss depends on setting realistic goals. For example, losing 10 percent of your total body weight within 6 months is a\n\nsensible goal that you can probably reach and, most important, maintain. The sense of accomplishment you get from reaching your goal will encourage you to keep the weight off and possibly lose more.\n\nFad diets that promise quick and easy results usually deliver nothing but disappointment. Such diets can even harm your health. For example, diets that eliminate entire food groups such as carbohydrates can cause you to become deficient in essential nutrients such as amino acids. High-protein diets are often high in saturated fat, which can raise cholesterol levels. The surest way to lose weight and keep it off is by eating fewer calories and being more physically active. Follow the healthy eating advice in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (see page 37).\n\nDoctors recommend losing about 1 to 2 pounds per week. To lose 1 pound per week, you need to burn 3,500 calories more in a week than you take in. You can achieve this by reducing the number of calories you eat by 500 to 1,000 per day or by boosting the number of calories your body burns by the same amount, through increased physical activity. You can lose weight even faster by both reducing calories and exercising more. For example, an inactive 200-pound person who continues to take in the same number of calories but begins walking briskly 1½ miles each day will lose about 14 pounds in a year. By decreasing his or her calorie intake at the same time, he or she will lose substantially more.\n\nAbout three fourths of the calories you burn every day are used to meet your body's basic needs—sleeping, digesting food, and breathing. Any additional physical activity will burn extra calories. You use only a small number of calories when you sit quietly, but you can burn many more when you walk, ride a bike, jog, swim, lift weights, or play tennis. Engaged in the same activity, a heavier person burns more calories per minute than a lighter person does. For example, a person who weighs 150 pounds burns one third more calories than does a person who weighs 100 pounds. Working harder or faster at a given activity only slightly increases the number of calories you burn. Increasing the amount of time you spend on the activity is a better way to burn more calories.\n\n[Terrorism > WARNING! > Over-the-Counter Weight-Loss Drugs]\nMany over-the-counter weight-loss drugs contain phenylpropanolamine (PPA), which is also found in some over-the-counter nasal decongestants. (In 2004, the FDA banned the use of ephedra, also called ma huang, in over-the-\n\ncounter products.) PPA can increase the risk of stroke from bleeding in the brain. Read all package labels carefully, and do not buy any over-the-counter drugs that contain PPA.\n\nIf you plan to start a weight-loss program to lose more than 20 pounds, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor first, especially if you have a health problem, are significantly overweight, or have been inactive for a long time. In the meantime, here are a few helpful suggestions for successful weight loss:\n\n- Get support from friends and family.\n- Focus on the many positive health benefits you will get from losing weight.\n- Eat smaller, more frequent meals.\n- Don't skip meals, especially breakfast.\n- Set reasonable goals.\n- Make gradual changes in your diet and level of physical activity.\n- Exercise for at least 1 hour each day.\n\n[Terrorism > If You Are Underweight]\nSome people are underweight because of an eating disorder (see page 725) or because they have a condition, such as cancer, that causes weight loss. Because they need to maintain their weight or even add pounds, they have to take in more calories each day than they burn.\n\nIf you are underweight, you can do a number of things to gain additional pounds. Choose high-calorie foods, but make sure that they are rich in nutrients; good examples are peanut butter, cheese, and milk shakes. Eat high-calorie fruits such as bananas, dried fruit, and canned fruit in syrup. Eat high-calorie vegetables such as olives, avocados, and corn. Eat two or three snacks between the three main meals of your day, but leave plenty of time between your meals and snacks so that you don't feel stuffed.\n\nAdd extra calories to your meals by using milk instead of water in soups and sauces. Put a slice of cheese over a baked potato or on your sandwich. Mix wheat germ or powdered milk into casseroles. Make high-calorie shakes with fruit juice, yogurt, and bananas, or buy liquid nutritional supplements.\n\n[Terrorism > Reducing Stress]\nThe stress response is how the body reacts to threatening, overwhelmin", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "diet", "relation": "can harm", "tail": "health"}, {"head": "diets", "relation": "eliminate", "tail": "Disease"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

The brain can easily become overloaded with the constant release of the stress hormone cortisol, which can kill brain cells directly, impairing a person's ability to remember and learn. The constant release of cortisol makes us feel fatigued but we can't sleep; then we get anxious and depressed.\n\nMost people are aware of the psychological effects of stress, such as an inability to think clearly, make sound judgments, and remember. But stress also can produce angry outbursts, hostility, impatience, and reduced self-esteem, and can lead to depression and a wide range of physical problems, including headaches, indigestion, stomachaches (especially in children), and backaches. Stress can also cause dizziness, a rapid heartbeat, ringing in the ears, and muscle tightness.\n\nEven more serious, stress can contribute to the development of heart disease by damaging the arteries. The increase in blood pressure that occurs during a stress response exerts so much force on the linings of the arteries that it injures them, triggering an immune system response and making the artery walls susceptible to the buildup of plaque—deposits of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances. As these deposits build up, they make the arteries narrower and less able to carry blood to the heart.\n\nThe constant release of cortisol during chronic stress also causes high blood sugar (glucose) levels, triggering the release of the hormone insulin, which regulates the body's use of glucose for energy. The excessive, long-term release of insulin can eventually make the body resistant to the effects of the hormone, a condition that causes glucose to build up in the blood. This buildup of glucose in the blood can lead to type 2 diabetes (see page 894).\n\n[Terrorism > Are You Under Too Much Stress?]\nIf you are trying to cope with a stressful situation, you may be at increased risk of stress-related illness. Keep in mind that positive changes (such as getting married or having a baby) can produce stress just as easily as negative changes. Here are some examples of common stressful situations:\n\n- Someone close to you died.\n- You recently were divorced or separated.\n- You or a family member has been hospitalized recently.\n- You got married recently.\n- You lost your job or retired.\n- You are having sex problems.\n- You just had a baby.\n- Your finances recently became a lot better or worse.\n- You changed jobs.\n- A child has left home recently or come back home.\n- You got a promotion at work.\n- You moved, or are remodeling your house.\n- Your job is at risk.\n- You have taken on substantial debt, such as a mortgage.\n\nTake steps to manage your stress before it overwhelms you or makes you sick. See the next page for the best ways to handle the stress in your life.\n\n[Terrorism > Stress and Sleep]\nDoctors have known for many years that lack of sleep can cause foggy thinking and poor concentration. But lack of sleep also can lead to potentially serious health problems. For example, chronic lack of sleep can place you at risk of developing type 2 diabetes (see page 894). Cortisol, a stress hormone that regulates the blood sugar glucose, seems to be to blame. Prolonged sleeplessness causes the body to continuously release cortisol into the bloodstream. This, in turn, causes a rise in glucose in the blood that prompts the body to release more and more insulin in an attempt to lower the glucose level. Over time, the increased production of insulin leads to insulin resistance, a condition in which the cells no longer respond to the effects of insulin; insulin\n\nresistance usually leads to type 2 diabetes. An excess of insulin in the blood also encourages the body to store fat, boosting the risk of obesity.\n\nThe chronic release of stress hormones caused by sleep deprivation affects your immune system, making you more susceptible to colds and infections. Also, because your immune system helps your body fight cancer, reduced immune system function from insufficient sleep can put you at increased risk of developing cancer.\n\nChronic lack of sleep can also accelerate the aging process. When you don't get enough sleep, your brain doesn't make the normal amounts of hormones, producing hormone levels similar to those of a much older person. However, subsequently getting a full night's sleep reverses this aging effect, returning hormone levels to normal.\n\nTo get a full night's sleep, try going to bed earlier than you usually do. Use some of the time you might spend relaxing in front of the TV for needed sleep. Keep your bedroom cool (but not cold); most people find it difficult to sleep in a room that is too hot.\n\nIf you have trouble getting a good night's sleep, the following strategies may be helpful:\n\n- Go to bed and get up at the same time every day—even on weeken", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "cortisol", "relation": "impairs", "tail": "ability to remember and learn"}, {"head": "stress", "relation": "produces", "tail": "angry outbursts"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

On your days off, do something fun with your family or a friend. Take a vacation every year or at least try to get away for a long weekend. If you can't leave town, take time off work to relax at home, finish projects, or enjoy hobbies or other activities.\n\n[Terrorism > *Concentrate on the Present*]\nDon't brood about things that happened in the past. Holding on to regrets, anger, or old grudges is especially harmful because it can keep you from enjoying life. Don't worry about the future. Think about the future in terms of changes you can make. Try not to worry about circumstances you cannot control.\n\n[Terrorism > *Take Action*]\nOnce you have decided what to do about a problem, act quickly and decisively. Being proactive can give you a sense of accomplishment and can often immediately eliminate a source of stress. However, don't act impulsively—especially if you are angry. Wait until you have calmed down and worked out a sensible plan before you take action.\n\n[Terrorism > *Don't Play the Blame Game*]\nAvoid blaming other people for your problems. Even if you have been treated badly, holding on to feelings of anger, frustration, or hostility can be harmful to your health. Also, blaming other people prevents you from making positive, constructive changes that can help you avoid similar problems in the future.\n\n[Terrorism > *Get Help*]\nIf you feel that you can no longer cope, get help. Talk to your doctor, contact your hospital social services department, or go to a community mental health agency for a referral to a mental health professional. You also may benefit from joining a support group for people who have similar problems. Your doctor may recommend counseling\n\nto help you learn more positive ways to deal with stress or may prescribe medication such as an antidepressant. Medication can sometimes be effective for treating stress, but it is most effective when used in conjunction with one-on-one counseling or therapy.\n\n[Terrorism > The Relaxation Response]\nDeveloped by Herbert Benson, MD, at Harvard Medical School in the early 1970s, the relaxation response is a simple technique that draws on the meditative practices of Eastern philosophies. The relaxation response has been shown to reverse the effects of stress on the body. It is a simple technique that you can complete in about 20 minutes.\n\nIf you are experiencing stress, try to do this exercise twice a day (but wait until at least 2 hours after your last meal):\n\n1. Sit quietly in a relaxed position.\n2. Close your eyes.\n3. Starting at your feet, consciously relax your muscles. Work your way up your body, relaxing your legs, pelvic region, back, chest, arms, neck, and face.\n4. Breathe naturally with your mouth closed. Be conscious of your breathing. Say the word “one” silently to yourself every time you exhale.\n5. If distracting thoughts enter your mind, ignore them and concentrate on your breathing. Let the thoughts pass.\n6. Stay relaxed and concentrate on your breathing. Keep repeating “one” to yourself for 10 to 20 minutes.\n7. When you are finished, don’t get up right away. Stay seated for a few minutes, first with your eyes closed and then with your eyes open, to gradually refocus on your surroundings.\n8. Don’t worry about whether you have done the exercise correctly. Just allow the relaxation to occur at its own pace.\n\nIf you don’t have time to do the relaxation response exercise twice a day, or if you find yourself in an especially stressful situation, try to do the following exercise. This shorter exercise is especially helpful when you feel overwhelmed by events in your life and need a quick calming fix. You can do it anywhere—waiting in line, stopped at a red light, or on hold on the telephone.\n\n1. Relax and focus on your breathing. Count slowly to yourself backward from 10 to zero, one number per breath.\n2. When you reach zero, pause for a moment before resuming your activities.\n3. If you don’t feel relaxed, repeat the exercise.\n\n[Terrorism > Staying Safe]\nWhere you live, what you do for a living, and how you spend your leisure time are some of the factors that affect your health and safety. You can take a number of practical steps to help ensure that you and your family are safe at home and on the road. Many of these measures are simple—such as using seat belts each and every time you drive. Others—such as developing a home fire evacuation plan—require preparation and vigilance over time. If you use a commonsense approach to safety and supervise your young children, you can be assured that your family will remain relatively safe.\n\n[Terrorism > Keeping Your Children Safe]\nYoung children rely on adults to protect them from accidents and injury because they lack the judgment and experience to protect themselves.

You can prevent injury to your children by childproofing your home before they learn to walk. Use the following guidelines to tackle this project, but keep in mind that no safety\n\ndevice is completely childproof. You still need to closely watch your young children to keep them safe.\n\n- Buy safety latches and locks for cabinets and drawers in the kitchen and bathroom to prevent poisoning and other injuries. These inexpensive devices can stop your child from gaining access to household cleaners and other chemicals, medicines, and sharp objects such as knives. Make sure the latches and locks are sturdy enough to withstand pulling by small hands.\n- Put up safety gates to keep children away from stairs and other dangerous areas in the home. At the top of the stairs, anchor the gate to the wall with screws so it can't be dislodged. Check the gate to ensure that it has no openings large enough for a child's head to fit through.\n- In the kitchen, turn all stovetop pot handles inward when cooking so your child cannot reach up and pull down a pot.\n- Set your water heater temperature no higher than 120°F to prevent scalding, or buy an antiscalding device for your faucets.\n- Install spring-loaded electrical outlet covers to prevent electric shock and electrocution.\n- Cut your window blind and drapery cords to prevent a child from strangling in the cord loops. You can also install cord cleats or tension devices to keep cords out of reach. Check at your local hardware store. You can get free replacement tassels, cord stops, and tie-down devices from the Window Covering Safety Council (1-800-506-4636).\n- Put safety bumpers on the corners and edges of furniture and fireplace hearths to prevent injury should your child fall on them. Remove any furniture that has sharp corners and edges.\n- Minimize your child's exposure to lead (see page 425).\n- Have your garage door professionally inspected to make sure that it is pinch-resistant and has properly working photo eyes and reversing mechanism. Teach children never to play with the garage door or its control panel or remote controls.\n- Don't keep a gun in the house (see page 72).", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "household cleaners", "relation": "prevent", "tail": "poisoning"}, {"head": "medicines", "relation": "prevent", "tail": "poisoning"}, {"head": "sharp objects", "relation": "prevent", "tail": "injuries"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "you", "relation": "use", "tail": "[Event: safety latches and locks]"}, {"head": "you", "relation": "watch", "tail": "[Event: young children]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

Hazards that are clear to adults may not be obvious to children. Supervision is still the best way to prevent injury. Give children extra guidance, especially when they are learning to walk. Make your home a safer place for children by following this simple advice:\n\n- Never leave infants alone on beds or changing tables. Strap infants and toddlers securely into high chairs and strollers. Put guardrails on the beds of young children.\n- Don't use infant walkers. Not only can they roll down stairs, but they can also delay a child's development of motor skills and may encourage a child to walk on his or her toes.\n- Bolt safety gates to the wall at the top of stairs.\n- Do not let children play on balconies or fire escapes.\n\n- Install window locks or guards on all windows, or keep windows closed and locked when children are present.\n- Supervise your children closely at all times while grocery shopping. Don't let children of any age play with, push, climb in and out of, or ride on the outside of a grocery cart. Always strap babies and toddlers into a grocery cart; switch to another cart if the belt is broken or missing. Never let a child stand up or lean over while sitting in a cart. Children who weigh more than 35 pounds should not ride in the baby seat of grocery carts (even when the child is strapped in, his or her weight can make the cart top-heavy and tip it over).\n\n[Terrorism > Keeping Your Children Safe > *Toy Safety*]\nToys can help a child have fun and learn. However, some toys pose a hazard to young children because they have small parts or can cause a fall. More than 100,000 children are treated at hospital emergency departments every year for injuries caused by toys. Sixty percent of these children are under age 4. Injuries often occur when a young child misuses or plays with a toy designed for older children. Boys are more susceptible than girls to injury from a toy. Most toy-related injuries occur to the head and face. Latex (rubber) balloons (see page 62), which cause choking, are by far the most dangerous toy. Riding toys such as toy cars, scooters, and bicycles account for a large proportion of toy-related injuries and deaths. Most injuries occur when a child falls from the riding toy, but they also occur when the child rides the toy into traffic or into a body of water.\n\nHere are some tips to help you choose toys that are both fun and safe for your child:\n\n- Look for toys that are designed for your child's age group.\n\n[Terrorism > Keeping Your Children Safe > **Falls From Windows**]\nUnsupervised young children can easily fall from an open window. In the United States, 15,000 children are injured every year and 15 to 20 die after falling from a window. Five times more children who live in apartment buildings—especially those without air conditioning—fall from windows than children who live in single-family homes. A child can be injured or killed falling from a window of any height, even from a first-floor window onto a soft surface.\n\nTo keep your child from falling out of an open window, install window guards or window stops. The metal bars of most window\n\nguards are spaced no more than 4 inches apart. The guards screw into the side of a window frame, come in different sizes to fit various window types, and can be adjusted for width. Some window guards are designed to be opened easily by an adult (allowing escape from a fire) but are difficult for a young child to open.

A third of the injuries occur in children who have been skate-boarding for less than a week. Common skateboard injuries include sprains, fractures, bruises, and cuts and scrapes from falls. Riding on irregular surfaces, performing risky stunts, and lack of experience, balance, and body control (which is common in children under 15) are factors that contribute to injuries. Falls and collisions with objects or vehicles such as cars can be fatal.\n\nTo lower your child's risk of being injured while riding a skateboard, teach him or her to follow these safety guidelines:\n\n- Check your skateboard after each use. Make sure it doesn't have any broken or loose parts, sharp edges, or cracked wheels. If it does, don't use it again until it has been fixed by a qualified repair-person.\n- Wear protective clothing such as a helmet; slip-resistant, closed-toe shoes; elbow and knee pads; wrist guards; gloves; and a padded jacket and shorts. Protective gear is not required to conform to government safety guidelines, so be careful when making a selection. Choose gear that fits properly and does not obstruct your hearing or vision.\n- Stay away from irregular surfaces. More than half of all skateboard injuries occur from riding on holes, bumps, rocks, or debris. Check the area where you intend to ride. Better yet, use a designated skateboard park.\n- Don't show off. Difficult stunts take careful practice in an area designed for skateboards. Never hitch a ride from a bicycle, car, or other moving vehicle.\n\n- Learn how to fall. If you lose your balance, crouch down low (to shorten the distance you fall), avoid stiffening your body, and roll with the fall. Try to land on the fleshy parts of your body (such as the thighs or buttocks) instead of trying to break the fall with your arms or hands.\n\n[Terrorism > *Skateboards* > *Playground Safety*]\nPlaygrounds are exciting areas for children to explore and develop motor and social skills. But no national regulations exist for the manufacture or installation of playground equipment, although the federal government has established voluntary guidelines for equipment and ground surfaces. When taking your children to a public playground, it's up to you to check the equipment to make sure it is safe. Look for the following playground safety features:\n\n- Surfaces around the playground equipment should have at least 12 inches of wood chips, mulch, sand, or pea gravel, or be made of safety-tested rubber material.\n- The protective surface should extend at least 6 feet from play equipment in all directions. Surfaces around swings should extend to twice the height of the suspending bar both in front and in back.\n- Play structures that are more than 30 inches high should be spaced at least 9 feet apart and have guardrails to prevent falls.\n- Openings in guardrails or between ladder rungs should be less than 3½ inches or more than 9 inches.\n- Sharp points or edges on hardware such as bolt ends should not protrude from the equipment.\n- Tripping hazards such as tree roots or stumps or exposed concrete footings should be eliminated.\n\nDon't let young children climb higher than 4 feet (5 feet for older children) because, at greater heights, even recommended surfaces cannot adequately absorb a child's fall. Check your neighborhood playgrounds regularly to make sure the equipment and surfaces are in good condition. Always keep an eye on your children at the playground because supervision is the best way to prevent injuries.\n\n[Terrorism > *Skateboards* > *Child Safety Seats*]\nIn the United States, motor vehicle collisions are the No. 1 cause of death among children. The best way to protect your child from the risk of injury and death on the road is by using a child safety seat. When purchasing a child safety seat, select one that is right for your child's age and weight, and make sure it fits in your car. Before buying a car seat, try it out in your car to make sure it can be installed properly. Nearly four out of five child safety seats are used improperly because the methods of attachment in different types of motor vehicles vary widely. The three most common mistakes people make when installing car seats are failing to belt the seat into the vehicle tightly enough, keeping the harness straps too loose, and not placing the harness retainer clip at the level of the child's armpit.\n\nAll child safety seats manufactured after September 2002 have been standardized. Every new vehicle sold in the United States includes an installation system that uses upper tethers and lower anchors to secure child safety seats. The system, called LATCH (which stands for \"lower anchors and tethers for children\"), makes it unnecessary to use seat belts to install car safety seats.

These same advances can expose them to pornography and violence and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by online sexual predators. To lower the chances of your child being victimized, take the following steps:\n\n- Keep the computer in the den or family room—not in your child's bedroom—so the screen is visible to all family members.\n- Use blocking software and other parental control devices provided by your service provider.\n- Explain the possibility of online sexual exploitation, especially in chat rooms, to your child.\n- Ask your child to show you his or her favorite Web sites and discuss his or her choices.\n- Check your child's e-mail messages from time to time, and tell your child why you are doing so.\n- Find out if computer safeguards are used by your child's school, the library, and the parents of your child's friends.\n- Teach your children never to arrange a face-to-face meeting with strangers they chat with online, never post photographs of themselves on the Internet, and never give out identifying information such as a telephone number.\n\nHere are some signs that your child might be engaging in potentially risky behavior on the Internet:\n\n- Your child turns the computer screen off or changes it when you come into the room.\n- Your child spends long periods of time online, especially at night.\n\n- You find pornography on your child's computer.\n- Your child gets or makes phone calls to numbers you don't recognize, especially long distance.\n- Your child gets mail or gifts from someone you don't know.\n- Your child uses an online account belonging to someone else.\n\nIf you notice any of these signs, talk to your child about your suspicions openly. Explain that even if your child is a willing participant, he or she is not at fault because the adult always bears full responsibility for such exploitation. If your child ever receives child or adult pornography online or in the mail or if anyone ever sexually solicits your child, call your local police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\n[Terrorism > Keeping Your Home Safe]\nMany people are injured in their own homes. This section covers basic safety guidelines you can use to make your home as safe as possible. Go through your home room by room to check for safety hazards, especially those that might not be easily visible. Taking a few simple measures, such as installing carbon monoxide detectors and keeping stairs free of clutter, can eliminate many potential dangers.\n\n[Terrorism > Keeping Your Home Safe > *Preventing Falls in the Home*]\nFalls are the leading cause of accidental death and one of the major causes of injury and death among people older than 65. Most fatal falls occur within the home, mainly on stairs and steps, or from beds and ladders. People over 65 are at increased risk of falling because of reduced vision, slower reaction times, and medical conditions and medications that can affect balance.\n\nYou can lower the chances of falls in your home by taking a few simple precautions to fallproof your home. Take steps now to reduce clutter and eliminate slippery surfaces. For ways to protect children from falls, see page 64. Here are some examples of things you can do to make your home safer:\n\n- **Outside** Repair any damaged steps or broken pieces of concrete on sidewalks. Rake or sweep away slippery, wet leaves from sidewalks, stairs, and porches. Eliminate ice from these areas during the winter.\n- **All rooms** Keep electrical and telephone cords away from where people walk. Pick up toys, clothes, newspapers, books, and any other items that don't belong on the floor.\n\nPack away and store extra furniture. Keep your floors clean and dry, and don't wax them. Make sure lighting is adequate. Teach pets not to jump on you or weave between your legs. Arrange your furniture to provide open walkways. Eliminate glass tables, which can shatter during a fall, and furniture that has unprotected sharp edges. If you use area rugs, make sure they have a nonskid backing.\n\n**Kitchen and bathroom** Clean up spills and wipe away standing water immediately. Don't climb onto the counter to reach items on a high shelf; use a sturdy step stool. Place a night-light in the bathroom and in the hallway that leads to it. Place a rubber mat or nonskid stickers in the tub.\n\n**Stairways** Pick up clutter and toys on the stairs. Install handrails on both sides. Put a night-light on the stairway. Consider installing a carpet runner if the wooden steps are slippery.\n\n[Terrorism > Keeping Your Home Safe > *Protecting older people from falls*]\nAs people get older, they can become more susceptible to falls because of increased use of medications, disorders that affect the joints (such as arthritis) or nervous system (such as Parkinson's disease), and age-related ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "pornography", "relation": "exposes", "tail": "children"}, {"head": "violence", "relation": "exposes", "tail": "children"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

But the risk to the people in the home, especially to children, far outweighs any security benefits—most shooting victims are family members or friends, not intruders. A person living in a home with a gun is 18 times more likely to be killed by the gun than is a stranger. The risk is higher if the home environment includes a person who is violent or verbally abusive, abuses alcohol or drugs, or is depressed. Each year, nearly 6,000 Americans under age 20 die of gun-related injuries, including unintentional injury, homicide, or suicide. For each child killed by a gun, four others are wounded, many so badly that they become permanently disabled.\n\nTo protect your family from gun-related injury, don't keep a gun in your home. If you are concerned about protection, take other steps to protect your home and family—buy a home security system, put reinforced bars on your windows and dead-bolt locks on your doors, add outdoor lighting, and start a neighborhood watch program.\n\nMany unintentional injuries occur because a curious child or adolescent plays with or handles an improperly stored gun. If you feel the need to keep a gun in your home for security purposes, or if you keep one or more for hunting, lower your family's risk of injury and death by storing it unloaded (with a gun lock in place) in a locked cabinet or drawer. Make the key available only to responsible adults. Don't tell your child where the gun is stored, because he or she may be tempted to show it off to friends. Keep the ammunition in a separate locked cabinet.\n\nTeach your children never to touch a gun, and tell them to call you or another adult if they ever find one, even if they think it may be a toy. When your children are invited to another child's house to play or if they are going to the home of a baby-sitter, ask if there is a gun in the home and if it is properly stored. If the gun is not properly stored, invite the other child or the baby-sitter to your home.\n\n[Terrorism > *Fire Safety*]\nMore than 4,000 people in the United States die in fires each year, and an additional 25,000 are injured. Bedrooms are common sites for fires to start—especially electrical fires—and most home fires occur at night when people are asleep. Many fires occur when extension cords are overloaded or portable space heaters are placed too close to bedclothes or draperies. Other common causes of fires are children playing with matches and smokers falling asleep with a lit cigarette.\n\n[Terrorism > *Preventing home fires*]\nFire is a major cause of injury and death and can rob you of your home and your most treasured possessions. Take steps now to protect your family and home from fire:\n\n- Keep matches and lighters locked away from children.\n- Keep bedding, clothes, curtains, and other combustible items at least 3 feet away from space heaters.\n- Make sure electrical cords are not frayed, especially cords on electric blankets.\n- Don't overload wall outlets.\n- Never smoke in bed.\n- Replace any mattress made before 1973. (Federal mattress flammability standards were raised in 1973.)\n- Install smoke detectors (see below) on every floor of your house. Have one close to the bedrooms.\n- Avoid planting trees or shrubs that can catch or spread fire easily. Consider planting fire-resistant plants around your home.\n- Have your home heating system checked by a professional every year.\n- Place a fire screen in front of your fireplace.\n- Get your chimney cleaned and inspected each year.\n- Consider installing residential fire sprinklers.\n\n[Terrorism > *Preventing home fires* > Smoke Detectors Save Lives]\nSmoke detectors—small, battery-powered devices that sound an alarm when exposed to smoke or fire—dramatically increase your chances of survival in a fire. Install a smoke detector on every floor of your home, and make sure one is installed near the bedrooms. Test the smoke detector every month by pressing the test button on the front of the alarm. Change the batteries once a year. Smoke detectors need to be replaced about every 10 years, or according to the manufacturer's guidelines.\n\nThe best way to protect your family's safety in a fire is to have an escape plan that you practice every month. Plan at least two ways out of every room. If your secondary exit must be through a window, make sure you'll be able to get to the ground safely. If necessary, buy a collapsible ladder that you can quickly and easily hook on the windowsill and hang out the window. If you have security bars or window guards on\n\nyour windows, make sure they are the kind that have a quick-release device so they can be opened quickly in an emergency. Check all of your windows to make sure they are not painted shut or otherwise stuck in a closed position.\n\nWhen you practice your escape plan, rehearse feeling your way out of the house in the dark or with your eyes closed.

Most of the injured are boys between ages 5 and 14 who play with fireworks such as bottle rockets and sparklers, which are sold legally in many states. Burns to the eyes, hands, and face are the most common injuries. Children lack the physical coordination to handle fireworks safely. The safest way to prevent injury from fireworks is not to buy them and to keep them out of your home and away from children. Enjoy fireworks displays at a local show put on by professionals who are trained to use them safely.\n\n[Terrorism > Motor Vehicle Safety]\nDriving defensively may not be enough to keep you safe on the road. Collisions and breakdowns can make you vulnerable to injury from passing vehicles. Alcohol is a factor in more than 40 percent of all fatal motor vehicle crashes, and nearly 300,000 people are injured in alcohol-related collisions each year. The best defense is to wear your seat belt each and every time you drive. Don't forget to buckle up your children in an age-appropriate safety seat (see page 67), and never let a child age 12 or under ride in the front seat because of the risk of injury and death from a passenger-side air bag (see right).\n\n*Seat Belts Save Lives*\n\nSeat belts save thousands of lives each year. If you are not wearing a seat belt and you hit something or slam on your brakes, your vehicle will stop but you will keep moving until you hit the windshield, the dashboard, or the back of a front seat. Wearing a seat belt prevents your body from being thrown around inside or out of the vehicle and can help the driver maintain control of the vehicle in a collision. Buckle up on every trip, no matter how short, and teach your children how to buckle up correctly. Here's the right way to wear a seat belt:\n\n- Adjust the lap belt to fit low and tight across your hips and pelvis, not across your abdomen.\n- Place the shoulder belt snugly across your chest, away from your neck.\n- Never put the shoulder belt behind your back or under your arm.\n\n[Terrorism > Motor Vehicle Safety > *After a Collision*]\nEach year, about one in every eight drivers has a motor vehicle collision. Many are minor rear-end collisions. If your vehicle is rear-ended and you don't feel safe or are uncomfortable getting out of your vehicle in traffic, signal to the other driver to follow you and then drive to the nearest police station, convenience store, or gas station to look at the damage and exchange insurance information. Some states require vehicles involved in a collision to remain at the site.\n\nThe following tips can help keep you safe when you are involved in a more serious collision:\n\n- Stop your vehicle if it is safe to do so, and then carefully move it out of traffic if you can.\n- Turn off the ignition of all vehicles involved in the collision.\n- Check all the people in each of the vehicles to see if they need medical help.\n- Call the police and, if necessary, call emergency medical assistance.\n\n[Terrorism > Motor Vehicle Safety > **WARNING!** > **Air Bag Safety for Children**]\nAir bags can save lives in a collision, but they inflate with a force powerful enough to kill or severely injure a child or small adult riding or driving in the front seat. Air bags can inflate after only a slight impact. Also, so-called smart air bags—which are designed to adjust their inflation force according\n\nto the size of the passenger or driver (or switch off entirely if the passenger is a young child)—are not 100 percent reliable. Any number of circumstances (such as humidity, shifting body weight on or off seats, the added weight of a child seat, extra tension in safety belts, and reclined seats) can cause air bags to deploy when they shouldn't, or not to inflate when they should. All children age 12 or under (including infants) should ride in the backseat to prevent serious injury or death from inflation of the vehicle's air bag.\n\n[Terrorism > Motor Vehicle Safety > *If Your Vehicle Breaks Down*]\nIf your vehicle breaks down along a busy road or highway, your greatest danger is getting hit by a passing vehicle. The problem is worsened by the elimination of roadside shoulders, which were designed as a place for disabled vehicles to stop but, in many places, are now being replaced with additional driving lanes. The following steps can minimize the danger if your car breaks down on the highway:\n\n- Pull off the road as far as possible.\n- Turn on your hazard lights and the interior dome light.\n- Put a white handkerchief or cloth on the antenna, and raise your hood.\n- Don't stand next to or behind your car, and don't walk along the highway. If you can, wait on the other side of the guardrail, well away from the highway. Or wait for help inside your vehicle with the doors locked. If you have a flare, place it behind your stalled car.\n- I", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "fireworks", "relation": "cause", "tail": "injuries"}, {"head": "children", "relation": "lack", "tail": "physical coordination"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "children", "relation": "participate in", "tail": "[Event: playing with fireworks]"}, {"head": "professionals", "relation": "put on", "tail": "[Event: fireworks displays]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

A young child can drown in a few seconds in 1 inch of water left in a bucket or wading pool. Even older children are at risk—drowning is a common cause of death in children under age 15. Follow these simple measures to protect children from water accidents:\n\n- Always supervise children closely when they are around water, and make sure they wear a US Coast Guard-approved life preserver or life jacket whenever they are in a boat or near a body of water. Don't rely on inflatable toys or water wings to keep a child afloat.\n- Never leave young children alone in the tub, even for a few seconds. Bathtub seats are not safety devices and can tip over, trapping a child underwater.\n- Empty the bathtub and all buckets immediately after use.\n- Install a toilet lid lock to prevent children from falling into the toilet.\n- Sign children up for swimming lessons at about age 5. Children younger than 5 are not yet ready to learn how to swim and may take risks around water.\n- Teach children never to swim alone.\n- Warn children about the dangers of walking or skating on frozen lakes or rivers.\n\n[Terrorism > *Water Safety for Kids* > *Home Swimming Pools*]\nNationwide, hundreds of drownings occur in home swimming pools each year. Most of the casualties are children under age 5. Young children are unpredictable and need to be supervised constantly around water. It takes only a second for a child to become submerged—with no time to scream for help. Some simple measures can lower the chances of having an accident in your home pool:\n\n- Never leave a child in a pool unattended.\n- Keep a phone by the pool so you can call for help quickly.\n- Learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and insist that all your baby-sitters learn it too.\n- Don't get a home swimming pool until your youngest child is 5 years old.\n- Encircle your pool with a self-locking fence that is at least 48 inches tall and has vertical bars spaced no more than 4 inches apart. The fence should completely separate the pool from the house. Don't leave furniture or toys near the fence that a child could climb on to reach the pool.\n- Keep a pole, rope, and personal flotation device near the pool for rescue purposes.\n- Make sure that no standing water has collected in the pool cover; drownings can occur in inches of water.\n- Prevent electric shock by keeping electrical appliances away from the pool.\n\n[Terrorism > *Water Safety for Kids* > *At the Beach*]\nThe beach is a great place to take your family for recreation. To make each trip to the beach as safe as possible, follow these beach-safety measures:\n\n- Stay inside the designated swimming area, preferably in sight of a lifeguard.\n- Don't swim alone.\n- Check beach conditions for bad weather or other potential hazards.\n- Don't swim near piers, rafts, docks, pilings, or diving platforms—you could injure your head, neck, or spine, or someone could dive into you. Also, rip currents (seaward-moving water currents, which are difficult to swim against) tend to intensify around fixed objects such as piers.\n- If caught in a rip current, swim parallel to shore until you are out of the current. Don't try to swim against the current.\n- Be alert for dangerous aquatic life such as jellyfish.\n- Stay close to the shore so you have enough energy to swim back.\n\n[Terrorism > Preventing Violence]\nViolence is a major public health problem in the United States. The homicide rate is at least two to three times higher in the United States than in any other industrialized nation, and the homicide rate among Americans under age 24 is nearly eight times higher.\n\nThis chapter focuses on violence in the home. Family violence includes spouse abuse, child abuse, and elder abuse, but it also extends to violence in the media, which has been shown to increase aggressive behavior in children. You will learn how to prevent violence within your family, what to do if someone you know becomes a victim of violence, and how to protect yourself from sexual assault. You also will find tips on teaching your children to solve problems without resorting to violence.\n\n[Terrorism > Preventing Violence > Family Violence]\nIn the United States, most violence is committed in the home by family members—men against their partners, parents against their children, or adult children against their elderly parents. Spouse abuse, also called domestic violence or battering, is the most common form of family violence and the most common cause of injuries to women. Each year, millions of children and as many as half a million elderly Americans become victims of abuse.\n\n[Terrorism > Preventing Violence > Family Violence > *Spouse Abuse*]\nSpouse abuse is recurring coercive behavior intended to intimidate a partner through physical battering (including slapping, punching, kicking, or choking), emotional", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "child", "relation": "is at risk of", "tail": "drowning"}, {"head": "young child", "relation": "can drown in", "tail": "1 inch of water"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "parent", "relation": "supervises", "tail": "[Event: children around water]"}, {"head": "child", "relation": "wears", "tail": "[Event: US Coast Guard-approved life preserver or life jacket]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: child left alone in tub]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: drowning]"}, {"head": "[Event: not wearing life preserver or life jacket]", "relation": "increases risk of", "tail": "[Event: drowning]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Teach your child to be assertive enough to have his or her needs met, without being aggressive. The following steps can help your child become a person who is thoughtful and considerate of other people:\n\n- Give your child plenty of love, respect, and attention. He or she will feel secure and will imitate your behavior when interacting with others.\n- When your child says or does something hurtful to another person, ask him or her to think about how the other person must be feeling and to apologize.\n- Teach your child to use positive problem-solving skills such as talking instead of yelling or hitting.\n- Teach your child to treat everyone with respect.\n- Don't use corporal punishment to discipline your children. Violence doesn't change behavior in the long run and teaches children to resolve problems with violence.\n- Don't let your child watch violent TV shows, movies, DVDs, or videotapes or play violent interactive video or computer games. Frequent exposure to media violence increases aggressive behavior in children.\n\n- Never allow your child to carry a weapon for self-defense. Knives or guns can easily be stolen or cause unintentional injury.\n\n[Terrorism > Media Violence]\nMore than half of all current television programming contains some type of violence. Two thirds of programming targeted to children contains violence. Exposure to violence on television can have a long-term negative impact on children. In addition to desensitizing children to violence, viewing violence on television may increase aggression, as children try to imitate the violence they see. They may learn to accept violence as a legitimate way of solving problems. Seeing violent images on TV also can make a child afraid. Movies, music videos, interactive video games, and computer games are additional sources of violent images.\n\nThe two most important things you can do to protect your children from media violence are to prohibit them from watching TV programs and playing video games with violent content. Here are some additional tips:\n\n- Never put a TV or video game player in your child's bedroom.\n- Watch what your children are watching so you can monitor their viewing and talk about the programs.\n- Teach your children the difference between real life and the fantasy portrayed on TV. Tell them about the real-life consequences of the violent acts they see in the media. Talk about nonviolent ways the characters could have solved their problems.\n- Don't buy violent video games or computer games for your children.\n- Don't take your children to movies or let them watch rented movies that are not recommended for children.\n- Write letters to TV station program managers to request better programming for children.\n\n[Terrorism > Gang Violence]\nA street gang is a group of young people who engage in antisocial, destructive, or violent behavior, often involving criminal activity. A street gang typically claims a particular city block or street corner as its turf and vigorously defends it. Gang\n\nproblems occur primarily in large cities, but gang activity is occurring increasingly in the suburbs and in rural communities. Although the majority of gang members are boys, girls organize and are involved in their own gangs in many areas.\n\nMuch violence occurs between gangs and inside the gang itself. For example, gangs often initiate new members through vicious beatings and may expect new members to commit violent crimes such as armed robbery, rape, drive-by shootings, or even murder to gain acceptance by the group. Sometimes innocent bystanders become victims of gang violence.\n\nYou can make a difference by volunteering to work with young people, serving as a mentor, or providing opportunities for young people to engage in productive neighborhood projects and activities. Be vigilant about potential gang activity by always removing graffiti on your property and asking the police to discourage young people from loitering. Organize a neighborhood watch program and always report gang activity to the police. Find out what the local gang colors and styles of dress are, and discourage your children from wearing them so they won't be mistaken for a gang member.\n\n[Terrorism > Elder Abuse]\nExperts estimate that more than 450,000 older Americans living at home are abused or neglected every year. People age 80 or older experience abuse and neglect two to three times more often than younger people, and older women are abused more often than older men. Two thirds of all abusers of the elderly are their adult children or spouses. The most common forms of elder abuse include:\n\n- **Neglect** Failure to provide or pay for care, shelter, or other necessities for an older person.\n- **Emotional abuse** The use of insults, threats, humiliati", "response": {"entity_entity": [], "entity_event": [{"head": "child", "relation": "to think about how the other person must be feeling", "tail": "[Event: apologize]"}, {"head": "child", "relation": "to use positive problem-solving", "tail": "[Event: become thoughtful and considerate of other people]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

People use these treatments in a variety of ways—alone or in combination with other alternative therapies, instead of conventional treatments, or, most often, in addition to conventional treatments.\n\nIf you are using an alternative therapy or are considering trying one, tell your medical doctor. Using an alternative therapy as a substitute for conventional therapy without receiving an accurate diagnosis from a doctor can be harmful to your health. In addition, combining some treatments can be dangerous. For example, some herbs can interact with prescription or over-the-counter medications. Although results from an increasing number of studies on alternative therapies are being published in mainstream medical literature, there remains a general lack of understanding about how conventional and alternative therapies function together. Ask your doctor for scientific information about the safety and effectiveness of a particular treatment you are considering, or consult a reliable source, such as the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health, for guidance.\n\nThe complementary and alternative approaches discussed here are a few examples of the more popular treatments people are trying. These discussions are not endorsements by the American Medical Association of any treatments or therapies. The most widely used alternative treatments include herbal therapies and dietary supplements, acupuncture, mind-body therapies such as meditation, and manipulative therapies such as massage and chiropractic.\n\n[Terrorism > Alternative Medical Systems]\nAlternative medical systems are complete systems of medical theory and practice that have developed outside of conventional medicine. Some systems, such as homeopathy and naturopathy, evolved inside Western culture. Others, such as Chinese medicine and Ayurveda, developed in Eastern cultures. Other traditional medical systems exist in\n\nNative American, African, Middle Eastern, and South American and other cultures. Fragments of these medical systems still exist in the folk medicine practices of many of the people in these cultures, as well as those of many immigrants to the United States.\n\n[Terrorism > Alternative Medical Systems > *Homeopathy*]\nDeveloped in Germany in the 1790s by a physician, homeopathy is based on the theory that “like cures like.” According to this theory, natural ingredients that produce certain symptoms in a healthy person can cure the same symptoms in a sick person when the substances are highly diluted and given in small doses. Homeopathic doctors believe that the more highly diluted the substance, the stronger the medicine. They consider medicines produced in this way to be safer, producing fewer side effects than conventional medicines. The homeopath takes into account the person’s personality and mental and emotional states before prescribing a remedy. Homeopathy is used to treat a wide variety of illnesses. Its theoretical base has not been proven by medical science. A variety of published studies on homeopathy have had mixed results.\n\n[Terrorism > Alternative Medical Systems > *Naturopathy*]\nNaturopathy is an alternative medical system in which practitioners use natural healing forces in the body to help the body cure itself. Typical therapies include changes in diet, massage, water therapy, light therapy, soft tissue manipulation, and exercise as well as interventions such as acupuncture (see below) and minor surgery. Naturopathy views disease as an alteration in the process by which the body stays healthy and emphasizes the reestablishment of health over the treatment of disease. The effectiveness of naturopathy has not been proven scientifically.\n\n[Terrorism > Alternative Medical Systems > *Chinese Medicine*]\nTraditional Chinese medicine is an ancient system of health care that is based on the concept of chi, or qi (pronounced “chee”), the vital energy that flows throughout the body in specific pathways called meridians. According to this theory, disease occurs when the balance of chi is disrupted in the body.

Many drugs in use today are derived from plants, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also has approved more than 200 plant products for sale as dietary supplements. In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated as foods, not drugs. This means that the FDA does not require dietary supplements to undergo the same rigorous approval process required of prescription and over-the-counter medications before they appear on the market. In addition, manufacturers are not required to provide the FDA with evidence that their dietary supplements are safe or\n\neffective before marketing them. However, the FDA can remove a supplement from the market if it determines that the product is unsafe.\n\nAs with pharmaceutical drugs, the effects of herbs can vary greatly from one person to another, influenced by factors such as weight, sex, age, and general physical condition. In addition, the effects of herbs can be more subdued than those of pharmaceutical drugs, and herbs tend to have less noticeable side effects. But unlike most standard medications, herbal remedies can contain potentially harmful substances because of the lack of regulations for production. A manufacturer's growing conditions, storage, handling, and preparation also can affect potency.\n\nAlways let your doctor know about any herbal remedies or dietary supplements you are taking. Don't self-medicate with herbs or supplements without talking to your doctor first and getting a diagnosis. Some of these products can have harmful interactions with prescription and over-the-counter medications. For example, ginkgo biloba can cause excessive bleeding when taken with anticoagulating medications such as aspirin or warfarin.\n\nSome doctors recommend that people stop using supplements for at least 3 weeks before having elective surgery. Although adverse effects are rare, taking some herbs or dietary supplements before undergoing surgery can be harmful. Some supplements can speed or slow heart rate, intensify the effects of anesthesia, inhibit blood clotting, or cause the body to reject a transplanted organ.\n\nThe herbs and supplements discussed here are among the most common in the United States. Research has supported the use of some of these substances. For others, however, there is no scientific proof of effectiveness.\n\n[Terrorism > **Herbal Remedies and Dietary Supplements** > *Aloe Vera*]\nThe gel of the aloe vera plant is used to treat burns and heal skin infections. Companies that make skin-care and cosmetic products incorporate aloe into many of their preparations, including hand lotions and shaving creams. The dried outer leaf of the aloe plant is ingested as a powder or dissolved in liquids to aid digestion and relieve constipation. Aloe may cause intestinal cramping, so you should not consume it if you have an inflammatory intestinal disorder (see page 764) such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or if you have an intestinal obstruction. Do not take aloe during pregnancy because it can trigger contractions of the uterus. Children younger than age 12 should not consume aloe because of its laxative effect.\n\n[Terrorism > *Black Cohosh*]\nAlso known as black snakeroot or bugbane, black cohosh is a traditional Native American remedy for snakebites and gynecologic disorders. Derived from a plant from the buttercup family, black cohosh is used as a dietary supplement to treat hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, such as mood swings, insomnia, and vaginal dryness. It also is taken for the relief of premenstrual syndrome (PMS; see page 850).\n\n[Terrorism > *Black Cohosh* > Alternative Therapies for Menopause]\nDeciding whether to use alternative therapies after menopause is a decision that many women face as they get older. Hormone therapy (see page 853) with estrogen is very effective in relieving symptoms of menopause—such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness—but some forms of hormone therapy carry small but known health risks, especially with long-term use. Many women are considering alternatives to hormone therapy in hopes of alleviating their symptoms and possibly reducing the risks of heart disease and osteoporosis.\n\nOptions that postmenopausal women have explored include natural or plant estrogens, acupuncture, and herbal supplements such as black cohosh, red clover, hops, dong quai, and ginseng. Of the herbal supplements, black cohosh seems to be the most effective in reducing symptoms of menopause, but not enough evidence exists to determine whether any of these therapies are safe over the long term. Limited studies have shown that plant estrogens—such as those present in soy products, wild yams, and flaxseed—may benefit some women who have hot flashes.

Today it is taken internally to boost the immune system and to treat upper respiratory infections such as colds and the flu. Studies testing its effectiveness in reducing cold symptoms have had mixed results. Echinacea can cause allergic reactions in some people or interfere with immune-suppressing drugs (such as those prescribed to prevent rejection after an organ or tissue transplant).\n\n[Terrorism > *Ephedra*]\nAlso called ma huang, ephedra is a herbal Chinese medicine used for treating asthma and hay fever. Ephedra contains chemicals that have powerful stimulating effects on the nervous system and heart. Because ephedra suppresses appetite and burns fat, it was frequently used as a weight-loss supplement. The supplement was implicated in several deaths, and, for this reason, the FDA banned its use in products in 2004.\n\n[Terrorism > *Green Tea*]\nGreen tea is a drink made from the steamed and dried leaves of the *Camellia sinensis* plant, a shrub that is native to Asia. The Chinese have been drinking green tea for thousands of years to promote health. Green tea is used to relieve stomach problems (including vomiting and diarrhea), to prevent tooth decay, and to reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Because green tea contains cancer-fighting antioxidants, some researchers think it may protect against some cancers. Research is ongoing to understand the effects of green tea against cancer. In some people, green tea can cause allergic reactions. Because green tea contains caffeine, you should not drink more than 2 cups a day if you have an irregular heartbeat or panic attacks.\n\n[Terrorism > *Evening Primrose Oil*]\nEvening primrose oil, extracted from the seeds of the primrose plant (a tiny wildflower), is sometimes used for breast pain and the skin conditions allergic dermatitis and eczema.

There is no scientific evidence showing that the supplement is beneficial.\n\nDo not use evening primrose oil with an antiseizure medication because it can lower the medication's effectiveness.\n\n[Terrorism > *Evening Primrose Oil* > *Feverfew*]\nThe herb feverfew is a folk remedy used to help regulate the menstrual cycle. Some people take it to treat migraine headaches and the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Do not use feverfew with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or with anticoagulating medications such as warfarin or aspirin because it can increase bleeding. Because feverfew can induce menstruation, it should not be used during pregnancy.\n\n[Terrorism > *Evening Primrose Oil* > *Garlic*]\nThe cloves of the garlic plant are thought to have antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal effects. These immune-boosting effects may also help prevent some cancers. People use garlic to treat a variety of conditions including colds and other upper respiratory infections. Garlic contains an ingredient that has been shown to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels, help prevent blood clots, and possibly help lower blood pressure.\n\nThe only known side effects of garlic are allergic reactions in some people, stomach upset, and bad breath. You should not use garlic with anticoagulating medications such as warfarin or aspirin (because it can increase bleeding) or if you are breastfeeding (because it can alter the taste of breast milk and possibly cause colic in your infant).\n\n[Terrorism > *Evening Primrose Oil* > *Ginger*]\nGinger ingested as a powder or in liquids is taken to prevent motion sickness and to relieve nausea and vomiting, including that caused by chemotherapy, pregnancy, or anesthesia. It is considered a natural anti-inflammatory and can be helpful for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Ginger can cause mild stomach upset or allergic reactions in some people.

While the practice dates back thousands of years, the modern form of aromatherapy was developed in France in the 1920s by a physician and a chemist. Today many French doctors incorporate essential oils in their treatment plans for patients. Essential oils are extracted and distilled from the leaves, flowers, twigs, and roots of plants such as eucalyptus, geranium, rose, and lavender. The oils are then used in massages, baths, compresses, or salves. They may also be applied to the skin in creams, inhaled in steam, or dispersed into the air using an air pump, candle, or water spray.\n\nOdors can affect the limbic system of the brain (which governs emotions), and it is thought that aromatherapy exerts its effects in this way. Therapeutic claims for aromatherapy include improvement in mood, skin conditions, fatigue, joint problems, and pain. Such claims have not been studied or verified by medical research. Aromatherapy is not meant to be used as a substitute for medical care, but as a way to promote relaxation and relieve stress.\n\n[Terrorism > Aromatherapy > *Valerian*]\nValerian is a herb that is widely used in Europe as a sleeping aid. It seems to have few side effects but in rare cases can cause headaches, heart palpitations, and insomnia. Valerian should not be used with barbiturates because it intensifies their sedative effects.\n\n[Terrorism > Manipulative Therapies]\nManipulative therapies attempt to treat illness by manipulating or moving parts of the body. Manipulative therapies include chiropractic, massage therapy, and reflexology.\n\nOsteopathic medicine is included in this section, even though it is part of mainstream medical practice, because of its emphasis on the study and treatment of the musculoskeletal system through manipulation. Chiropractic focuses on the relationship between the structure of the body (primarily the spine) and how the body works. It is based on the belief that health can be restored through manipulation of the spine. Massage therapists manipulate the soft tissues of the body to relieve so-called restrictions (tightenings) and return the tissues to normal function.\n\nManipulative therapies have had varying degrees of success at treating chronic diseases, but are generally recognized as being effective for the treatment of lower back problems and pain.\n\n[Terrorism > Manipulative Therapies > *Chiropractic*]\nChiropractic is a system of therapy based on the theory that disease results from a lack of normal nerve function. Treatment focuses on the physical adjustment and manipulation of the muscle, tissue, and joints of the spinal column instead of using medication or surgery. To diagnose a medical problem, chiropractors usually take a health history, order X-rays of the spine, and perform a physical examination of the back. Once a diagnosis is made, the chiropractor then manually adjusts the vertebrae of the spine suspected of causing the problem. The number of treatments needed and the length of visits vary.\n\nChiropractic seeks to bring the skeletal structure into balance to restore or increase the range of motion of the spinal column. It can be effective in treating lower back problems, but claims that it can also treat such medical problems as high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes have not been proven scientifically.\n\n[Terrorism > Manipulative Therapies > *Osteopathic Medicine*]\nOsteopathic medicine is similar to conventional medical practice, with an emphasis on the study of the musculoskeletal system (bones, muscles, tendons, tissues, nerves, and the spinal column). Osteopathic medicine takes a holistic approach to health care, teaching that the human body is a unified system and that the musculoskeletal system plays a central role in a person's overall health.\n\nA doctor of osteopathy (DO) is a fully trained and licensed physician who has attended a 4-year osteopathic medical school and served a 1-year internship and a 2- to 6-year residency in a specialty area, as medical doctors (MDs) do. An osteopath can\n\nprescribe drugs and is qualified to practice all branches of medicine and surgery. Osteopaths use manipulation techniques such as stretching and thrusting in addition to conventional drugs and therapies to treat illness.\n\n[Terrorism > Manipulative Therapies > *Craniosacral therapy*]\nCraniosacral therapy is a form of osteopathic manipulation that involves gentle manual manipulation of the cranial (skull) bones to relieve tightening of the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord. Osteopaths think that relieving this tightening (which they call restriction) allows the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes these structures to flow smoothly, thereby correcting the neurologic dysfunction.

The most common forms of alternative mind-body therapies are guided imagery, meditation, prayer, yoga, and art and music therapy. Relaxation therapy, another popular mind-body technique, is discussed on page 59. Hypnosis and biofeedback are not included in this section because they are now generally accepted by the medical profession. Another mind-body technique that has become an accepted part of mainstream medical practice is cognitive-behavioral therapy (see page 710).\n\nMind-body therapies have been shown to provide many health benefits, including relieving stress, understanding illness, and restoring a person's sense of control.\n\n[Terrorism > **Mind-Body Therapies** > *Guided Imagery*]\nGuided imagery refers to the use of the imagination to produce positive images that may bring about healing changes in the body. The process is often guided by the voice of a practitioner or by a voice recording that leads the person to visualize a suggested relaxing or healing scenario (such as being on a beach) in which healing can begin. The theory behind guided imagery is that the body will react as if the positive image is real, and undergo healthful changes. Guided imagery is used in hospitals and other health\n\ncare settings for its proven benefit in managing pain, reducing anxiety, and strengthening the immune system.\n\n[Terrorism > **Mind-Body Therapies** > *Meditation*]\nMeditation is a technique in which a person rests or sits quietly, usually with his or her eyes closed, and performs mental exercises that help focus attention, achieve relaxation, and increase mental awareness. The person often reaches this state by silently focusing on his or her breathing or on a word or an object. The stillness of mind and deep relaxation achieved during meditation help relieve stress and can have a beneficial effect on many medical conditions, including high blood pressure and heart disease. Meditation is also used to help relieve chronic pain, headaches, and respiratory problems such as asthma.\n\n[Terrorism > **Mind-Body Therapies** > *Prayer*]\nSeveral scientific studies have shown that prayer may have an objective and positive effect on health outcomes. In these studies, the health of people who were prayed for improved substantially more than that of people who were not prayed for. This outcome occurred whether or not the person who was ill knew about the praying or believed in the power of prayer. Medical science cannot explain the connection between prayer and healing. However, many doctors encourage it because it can strengthen an ill person's emotional and psychological well-being and give encouragement to caregivers and loved ones.\n\n[Terrorism > **Mind-Body Therapies** > **Yoga**]\nYoga is a good way to increase your joint flexibility and muscle tone while learning to relax and counteract stress.\n\n![A black and white photograph of a woman sitting cross-legged on a yoga mat indoors, performing a seated meditation posture (Padmasana or similar). She is wearing a dark long-sleeved top and dark pants, with her eyes closed.]()![](_page_217_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[Terrorism > *Yoga*]\nYoga is a discipline developed in India over thousands of years that teaches a series of body postures and movements, breathing techniques, and meditation to calm the mind and relax the body. The goal of practitioners is to reach a state of harmony between the mind and the body that leads to spiritual enlightenment. This state of harmony is also believed to produce optimal health.\n\nThe physical benefits of yoga include increased flexibility, better balance, and stronger muscles. Yoga has been shown to reduce blood pressure, breathing rate, and anxiety. Yoga is also helpful for fighting insomnia, increasing range of motion in the joints, and decreasing pain in people with osteoarthritis (see page 996) or carpal tunnel syndrome (see page 699). The sustained focus of attention that yoga requires may help improve the mental abilities of older people.\n\nYoga postures should be learned from a practitioner and then practiced at home. If you are pregnant or have a chronic disorder such as high blood pressure, you may have to modify or avoid certain postures.\n\n[Terrorism > *Art Therapy, Music Therapy, and Dance Therapy*]\nSometimes doctors use art, music, and dance to treat emotional and physical problems in a way that complements more conventional drug and therapy treatments. Art, music, and dance therapies attempt to release the healing potential of the creative arts. These therapies are frequently used in hospitals, nursing homes, psychiatric facilities, and hospices to ease pain, promote relaxation, and treat depression.

Each area of the brain is responsible for different functions, such as language, vision, movement, or emotions. The peripheral nervous system consists of nerves that radiate from the brain and spinal cord to all parts of the body.

For example, after taking a health history and performing a physical examination on a person who has a chronic cough, a doctor may recommend a chest X-ray to determine the cause of the cough. For a person who may have had a stroke, a doctor might recommend computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the brain. These procedures can often find the cause of symptoms or narrow down the possible causes. In many imaging techniques (such as angiography), contrast mediums (dyes) or contrast agents (such as air or water) are used to make specific parts of the body easier to see.\n\nX-rays, discovered in 1895, were the first imaging technique used for diagnosing medical problems. Ultrasound, which was developed in 1952 to evaluate fetuses and\n\nmonitor pregnancies, uses sound waves to create an image. Diagnostic imaging advanced significantly in the 1960s with SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography), in the 1970s with the introduction of conventional CT scans, in the 1980s with MRI and PET (positron emission tomography), and in the 1990s with functional MRI (fMRI). New imaging techniques continue to be developed.\n\nUsing viewing devices called endoscopes, which are inserted directly into the body, doctors can see inside the body to evaluate tissues and organs and to perform procedures.\n\n[Terrorism > Imaging the Brain]\nWith computerized imaging techniques such as MRIs and PET scans, doctors can look inside the living, thinking brain. These newer imaging techniques have improved the ability of doctors to diagnose and locate the site of brain disorders. The techniques have also enabled them to understand the relationship between different areas of the brain, to learn about the functions of specific areas of the brain, and to develop new treatments for brain disorders.\n\n[Terrorism > Imaging the Brain > Brains of aggressive and nonaggressive teens]\nFor these images, a technique called functional MRI (fMRI) shows brain activity (orange areas at top of images) in teens who have disruptive behavior disorder (which makes them aggressive) and in healthy, nonaggressive teens as they play a violent video game. The images show less activity in the frontal lobe of a teen with the behavior disorder (left) than in the frontal lobe of the healthy teen (right), indicating that the teen with the disorder is less able to inhibit the violent emotions triggered by the video game.\n\n![Functional MRI scan showing brain activity (orange areas) in the frontal lobe of a teen with disruptive behavior disorder (left image).]()![](_page_236_Picture_6.jpeg)\n\nBrain of an aggressive teen\n\n![Functional MRI scan showing brain activity (orange areas) in the frontal lobe of a healthy, nonaggressive teen (right image).]()![](_page_236_Picture_8.jpeg)\n\nBrain of a nonaggressive teen\n\n[Terrorism > Brain hemorrhage]\nThis three-dimensional angiogram shows a brain after a type of stroke caused by a hemorrhage, or bleeding inside the brain.

Angiograms can help doctors diagnose blood vessel disorders and are frequently performed before surgery on a blood vessel to locate the sites of blockages or other problems. Before an angiogram, a contrast medium (dye) containing iodine (which shows up on X-rays) is injected through a thin, flexible tube (catheter) inserted through a small incision into the femoral artery in the groin, the brachial artery in the elbow, or one of the carotid arteries in the neck. A rapid series of X-ray pictures is then taken of the arteries. Any abnormalities in the arteries will show up on the X-rays.\n\nMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA) uses MRI (page 113) with angiography. In MRA, specific radio-pulse sequences are used (usually without using X-rays and usually without injecting a contrast medium) to create and enhance images.\n\n[Terrorism > THE PROCEDURE]\nIf you are having an angiogram, you will be asked to lie very still on an examining table. The area in which the catheter is inserted will be numbed with an anesthetic. A needle is inserted through the skin into the artery, and a long, thin wire with a soft tip is inserted through the needle. The needle is then removed and the catheter threaded over the wire into the blood vessel. When the contrast medium is injected, you will feel a sensation of warmth for a few seconds. The procedure lasts from a few minutes to a few hours. After the examination, you may be asked to lie still for a few hours. Angiography poses a slight risk of damage to blood vessels (at the site of the injection or anywhere along the blood vessel during passage of the catheter) and a risk of an allergic reaction to the contrast medium.\n\n[Terrorism > THE PROCEDURE > Aneurysm in a carotid artery]\nThis angiogram reveals an aneurysm, an abnormal ballooning of a weakened area in the wall of an artery (red area on left), as viewed from the back of the head. This aneurysm is in a carotid artery (one of two main arteries that\n\nsupply blood to the head and neck). If an aneurysm in the brain ruptures, it can cause a stroke.\n\n![Angiogram showing a brain aneurysm (red mass) and the surrounding blood vessels.]()![](_page_242_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n**Narrowed coronary artery** An angiogram of the arteries of the heart (called a cardiac arteriogram) is used to diagnose heart disease.

Although ultrasound was initially used to view fetuses, it is now used to examine every organ of the body, including the heart (an echocardiogram). Because ultrasound does not pose a risk of exposure to radiation, it is increasingly taking the place of conventional X-rays (see page 109) for diagnosing many different conditions. In ultrasound, sound waves are directed into the body through a wandlike device called a transducer, which is moved around the skin over the area to be examined. Ultrasound produces clear images of soft tissues and fluid-filled organs (such as the ovaries) but is less useful for examining organs filled with gas or air (such as the lungs). Also, ultrasound waves do not penetrate bone. The ultrasound images are displayed on a computer screen. Ultrasound is often used to guide the positioning of a needle during a biopsy (removal ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "angiography", "relation": "is used to examine", "tail": "blood vessels"}, {"head": "angiograms", "relation": "help doctors diagnose", "tail": "blood vessel disorders"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "contrast medium", "relation": "is injected through", "tail": "[Event: an angiogram]"}, {"head": "catheter", "relation": "is inserted through", "tail": "[Event: before an angiogram]"}, {"head": "X-ray pictures", "relation": "are taken of", "tail": "[Event: during an angiogram]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Using these techniques, a doctor can examine the structure and appearance of internal organs. Like computed tomography (CT) scanning (see previous page), MRI uses a computer to construct images from information recorded by the scanner. In MRI, however, the information is not provided by X-rays. Instead, the person being examined is placed inside a powerful magnet, which arranges the nuclei of some of the hydrogen atoms in the body in a precise pattern (like iron shavings around a magnet). A pulse of radio waves is then passed through the person's body, moving the nuclei of the aligned hydrogen atoms briefly out of alignment. The nuclei then return to their original pattern, emitting radio signals as they do so. Different tissues such as tumors emit a more or less intense signal. These signals are detected by the machine and analyzed by the computer. The information is then used by the computer to construct an image. MRI can sometimes produce more detailed three-dimensional images than CT.\n\nMRI technology includes magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). MRA, like other types of angiography (see page 110), is used to evaluate blood flow but does not use dyes or radioactive tracers. MRS is different from conventional MRI in that MRS uses a continuous band of radio waves to excite hydrogen atoms in a variety of chemical compounds other than water. The compounds absorb and emit radio energy at certain frequencies (or spectra) that can be used to identify them. A color image is created by assigning a color to each distinct spectral emission. MRS is used to produce color images of brain function and to identify the chemical composition of diseased tissue.\n\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)—also called brain mapping—uses the same MRI scanner hardware to provide noninvasive images of the brain's activity, and to detect changes resulting from biological function. Functional MRI tracks blood flow in the brain. The more active an area of the brain is, the more blood flows to it. Functional MRI enables doctors to take a series of images in quick succession and to analyze the differences between them. It also allows doctors to identify the parts of the\n\nbrain that “light up” (are active) when a person is asked to perform specific tasks or is exposed to certain stimuli.\n\n[Terrorism > THE PROCEDURE]\nBecause the MRI scanner creates a very strong magnetic field, you cannot carry or wear any metal objects (such as jewelry, eyeglasses, or hair clips) during the examination. Make sure you let your doctor know if you have any metal implants (such as artificial joints, plates, screws, or clips), metal attachments (such as dental braces), or electrical devices (such as a hearing aid), which could be affected by the magnet. It is especially important to tell your doctor if you have a pacemaker because the magnet can make the pacemaker stop working. Although MRI is not known to pose any health risks to a fetus, tell your doctor before having the procedure if you are (or could be) pregnant.\n\n[Terrorism > THE PROCEDURE > Prostate cancer]\nThis MRI scan of a male pelvis shows an enlarged prostate gland (dark brown) with a cancerous tumor (black kidney-shaped area).

You are given a signal button to alert the technician if you begin to feel uncomfortable during the test. (If you don't like confined spaces, ask your doctor for a sedative before the test.) Because the scanner is very noisy, you are given earplugs or headphones to help block the noise. You may be given a contrast medium through a needle inserted into a vein. You must lie still during the MRI, and you may be asked to hold your breath occasionally. In closed MRI, the table slides into a narrow tunnel inside the scanner. In open MRI, the scanner is quieter and less confining.

After the radioactive tracer is swallowed or injected, you may need to wait for it to travel through your bloodstream and collect in the target organ before you are examined by the gamma camera. Because this may take several hours, you may be allowed to leave the facility and return later to take the scan. While you are having the scan, you lie or sit on the examination table, and the gamma camera is moved close to the area being examined. You must stay very still during the scan, but you may be asked to change positions; the technician will reposition you and the camera if necessary. The amount of time the procedure takes varies from about 1 to 5 hours. In some cases, a second or third scan is required. Radionuclide scanning is painless (except for the injection of the tracer).

Although genes play a role in all diseases, lifestyle factors—such as exercise habits and diet—are even more important influences on your health risks. Your doctor can help you evaluate your health risks and recommend steps to take to reduce them. See your doctor regularly to make sure you have all the recommended checkups, screening tests, and vaccinations. In general, the earlier a disorder is diagnosed and treated, the better the outcome.\n\n[Terrorism > Routine Health Care]\nYou may need to choose a new doctor for a number of reasons: a move to another community, your doctor's retirement or relocation, new health insurance requirements, the need for a specialist, a problem with your current doctor, or to get a second opinion. Try to explore your options while you are well so that you don't have to rush into a decision during a crisis. Get a copy of your medical records from your former doctor or ask his or her office to send them to your new doctor. Everyone wants his or her doctor to be well trained, competent, and accessible. Compassion and high ethical standards are also important qualities in a doctor and are basic to good health care.\n\n[Terrorism > How to Choose a Doctor]\nIf you are in a health insurance plan, or if you need a doctor who will accept Medicare, the range of doctors you can choose from may be restricted. With this in mind, ask friends and relatives if they have had good experiences with their doctors. What do they like about their doctors? (Remember, however, that what they like about their doctors may not be the same qualities you are looking for.) Ask your current doctor or other health care professionals for recommendations. Find out from local medical societies which doctors are currently accepting new patients. Locate a medical center that\n\nspecializes in a particular area of health you're interested in, and ask your doctor for a referral to the center or call the center yourself and find out how to get an appointment.\n\nMany organizations (such as hospitals) have no-fee physician-referral services. You can also get information from doctor-selection services online or over the telephone. Most of these services organize their information according to type of practice and location. Others also provide information about a doctor's background, education, training, and professional achievements.\n\n[Terrorism > Doctor Finder]\nYou can locate doctors in your area by specialty through a physician-referral service called Doctor Finder, or AMA Physician Select, from the American Medical Association ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "chalazion", "relation": "caused by", "tail": "blockage of the glands that lubricate the edges of the eyelids"}, {"head": "entropion", "relation": "can cause", "tail": "eye inflammation"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "the cyst", "relation": "becomes", "tail": "[Event: infected]"}, {"head": "the eyelid", "relation": "can become", "tail": "[Event: red, painful, and more swollen]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment]"}]}, "status": "success"}

They may need to take several different prescription and nonprescription medications every day, and can easily become confused about what medication to take at what time. Some older people may accidentally skip doses or take extra doses, while others may have trouble swallowing their medication. All of these problems can present serious health risks.\n\nThe following tips can help an older person or his or her caregiver manage medications safely:\n\n- Make a list of the medications (both prescription and over-the-counter) the person is taking, and keep it up-to-date. Bring the list (or the containers) along to each office visit. This information helps the doctor prescribe and properly monitor the person's medications.\n- Tell the doctor promptly about any side effects or changes in the way the drug affects the person.\n- If the person has trouble remembering to take medication, try associating doses with specific times of the day—such as first thing in the morning, at bedtime, or with meals.\n- Keep a medication schedule on a calendar, and check off each dose as the person takes it.\n- Use a divided container to sort the person's doses of medication for the week. Plastic containers designed for this purpose are available at drugstores. Make sure that the container is labeled correctly.\n- Have the person take his or her medications exactly as prescribed. Never change the dosage or stop any prescribed medication unless the doctor tells you to do so.\n- Ask the doctor to prescribe medication in the form that is easiest for the person to take. For example, if the person has problems swallowing pills, the medication may be available in liquid form.\n- Encourage the person to take medication when sitting or standing rather than when lying down.\n\n- If the person has trouble opening containers, ask the pharmacist to use containers with easy-to-open lids. Always keep the containers out of the reach of children.\n- Make sure that the instructions on the labels can be read and understood. Request that medication labels be printed in large type.\n- Avoid keeping medications on a bedside table. This helps to prevent the person from taking the wrong drug or overdosing when he or she is not fully awake.\n- Keep the person's prescriptions up-to-date. If the doctor wants the person to continue taking a medication that is nearing its expiration date, be sure to inform the doctor as soon as possible so that he or she can call the pharmacist to renew the prescription or write a new one.\n- Dispose of all unused and expired prescription medications and over-the-counter medications. Throw them away.\n- Make sure that the person never takes any medication that was prescribed for someone else, and never gives his or her medication to anyone else.", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "medications", "relation": "treats", "tail": "health risks"}, {"head": "medication", "relation": "can cause", "tail": "serious health risks"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

When you are familiar with your body, you are more likely to notice any abnormal changes. Regular self-examinations—especially of the breasts, skin, and testicles—provide the best chance of detecting a tumor at an early stage, when it is small, easier to treat, and usually has a better chance for a cure.\n\n[Terrorism > Self-Examinations > Breast Self-Examination]\nEarly detection of breast cancer improves the chances for a cure. Many breast lumps are found by women themselves during regular breast self-examinations. All women should start examining their breasts for changes each month at age 18 and continue performing regular exams throughout their life. Any changes in the shape or feel of your breasts or changes in the skin or nipples can be early signs of breast cancer. Look for hard or soft lumps, changes in skin texture (such as scaling) or color (such as redness), puckering or depression (such as dimpling) in part of the breast, a newly inverted nipple, or a discharge of any kind from a nipple. Each woman's breasts are unique, so it's important to get to know your breasts to be able to tell what's normal for you.\n\nPerform a breast self-examination every month at the same time in your menstrual cycle. The best time to do a self-exam is right after your menstrual period ends (about 7 to 10 days after your period starts), when your breasts are less tender or swollen. If you take oral contraceptives, do the self-exam when you start a new pill pack each month. If you are on hormone therapy (see page 853), ask your doctor about the best time to perform a breast self-examination. After menopause, choose a specific day of the month and perform the exam on that day each month.\n\nIf you detect anything unusual in a breast, let your doctor know right away. Although most breast lumps and other changes are not cancerous, they all should be evaluated by a doctor.\n\n[Terrorism > Self-Examinations > Percentage of cancerous tumors]\nBreast cancer is more likely to occur in some parts of the breast than in others. Most breast tumors occur in the upper, outer part of the breast (toward the armpit) or behind the nipple. Examine all parts of your breasts, but pay special attention to these areas. The percentage of cancerous tumors that are found in each part of the breast are shown here.\n\n![Diagram of a woman's breast showing the percentage of cancerous tumors found in different parts of the breast.

Raise the arm on that side and rest it over your head on the bed or floor.

Some screening tests, such as the fecal occult blood test, are recommended for everybody after a certain age, while other tests are recommended for women or men specifically. For example, the Pap smear is recommended for women (to detect cervical cancer) and the PSA test is recommended for men (to detect prostate cancer).\n\n[Terrorism > Common Examinations and Tests > Pelvic Examination and Pap Smear]\nA pelvic examination is often performed as part of a routine gynecologic checkup. During the examination, you lie on your back on an examining table with your feet in stirrups and your knees apart and bent. The doctor will insert an instrument called a speculum into your vagina to hold it open while he or she checks for any abnormalities in the walls of your vagina and cervix (the opening into the uterus).\n\nIn a procedure called a Pap smear, the doctor swabs a few cells from the cervix to send to a laboratory, where they are examined for abnormal changes that could become cancerous. After taking the sample cells, the doctor will remove the speculum and insert one or two gloved fingers into your vagina to check for abnormalities in the uterus, ovaries, or fallopian tubes. Your doctor may examine your rectum as well at this time and take a sample of stool for laboratory testing.\n\nThe results of your Pap test usually come back in a few weeks. The test result is negative if the cells are normal; the result is positive if the cells are precancerous or cancerous. If the results indicate cancerous or precancerous cells, your doctor will\n\narrange for further tests and treatment. If the results are inconclusive—referred to as ASCUS (for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance)—the test may have to be repeated every 3 months until definite results come back or until the doctor performs a colposcopy (see page 874) to examine the cervix directly.\n\n[Terrorism > Common Examinations and Tests > The pelvic examination]\nDuring a pelvic examination, a doctor examines the pelvic organs by hand to feel for any abnormalities of the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes.\n\n![Diagram illustrating a pelvic examination. Hands are shown palpating the internal female reproductive organs. Labeled structures include the Fallopian tube, Ovary, Uterus, Vagina, Rectum, and Cervix.]()![](_page_311_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\nMany laboratories perform genetic tests on Pap smears to identify specific strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV) that are known to increase a woman's risk of cervical cancer. If the results of your Pap smear show that you have been exposed to a cancer-causing strain of HPV, your doctor may recommend that you have more frequent Pap smears or a colposcopy.\n\nYou should have your first Pap smear when you are planning to become sexually active or by age 18. To help prevent cervical cancer, see your doctor regularly—every year or as often as your doctor recommends—for a Pap smear, which makes early detection of cervical dysplasia (see page 874) possible. A Pap smear can help prevent cancer by detecting highly treatable precancerous changes in the cervical cells, which can then be destroyed at an early stage.\n\n[Terrorism > Common Examinations and Tests > Mammograms]\nA mammogram is a low-intensity X-ray that provides a picture of the internal structure of the breast. Digital mammography records the X-rays in computer code rather than on X-ray film. Mammograms are used as a screening test for breast cancer in women over 40 to detect cancers at an early stage, when they are generally easier to treat and more likely to be cured. Diagnostic mammograms are used to evaluate breast changes such as lumps, pain, or nipple discharge and to look more closely at abnormalities found on a screening mammogram. Although lung cancer kills more women each year, breast cancer is the most common cancer in American women, especially those between ages 50 and 69.\n\nMost doctors recommend that women have a baseline screening mammogram at about age 40 and then have mammograms every 1 to 2 years. For women who are at increased risk of breast cancer (see page 857)—such as those who have a family history of breast cancer (especially in a mother or sister)—a doctor may recommend starting regular mammograms at a younger age. You can obtain a high-quality mammogram at a breast clinic, the radiology department of a hospital, a private radiology office, or at a doctor's office.\n\n[Terrorism > Common Examinations and Tests > **Detecting breast tumors early**]\nIn general, the earlier breast cancer is detected and treated, the higher the chances for a cure.

During a digital rectal examination, a doctor inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum and may use the other hand to press on the lower abdomen or pelvic area. A digital rectal exam is frequently done as part of a routine physical examination in men and a routine pelvic examination in women, or to find the cause of symptoms such as pelvic pain or rectal bleeding. During the exam, the doctor usually takes a sample of stool from the rectum to test it for blood, which can be an early sign of colon cancer. In men, a doctor can feel the prostate during a digital rectal examination; in women, the doctor can feel the uterus and ovaries to check for abnormalities. Other organs, such as the bladder, can sometimes also be felt during a digital rectal examination.\n\n[Terrorism > Sigmoidoscopy]\nFlexible sigmoidoscopy is used as a screening test for cancer in the lower part of the large intestine (the sigmoid or descending colon), which runs from the rectum through the last section of the colon. Sigmoidoscopy is also used to find the cause of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and constipation, or to diagnose and monitor conditions such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. For the procedure, a doctor inserts a short, flexible, lighted viewing tube (sigmoidoscope) into the rectum and slowly guides it into the lower colon. As the doctor withdraws the tube, he or she looks through it, carefully examining the rectum and colon.\n\nIf the doctor finds anything unusual, such as an abnormal growth (polyp) or inflamed tissue, he or she will remove a small sample of tissue (biopsy), using instruments inserted through the scope. The tissue sample is sent to a laboratory for examination under a microscope. If you have polyps, which can sometimes become cancerous, your doctor will recommend that you have a colonoscopy (see page 767), which allows the doctor to examine the entire colon.\n\nBefore having a sigmoidoscopy, you will be given instructions about emptying your intestine. For example, your doctor may recommend that you have one or two enemas before the procedure, and you may be asked to use a laxative or to modify your diet in some way. For the procedure, you lie on your side on an examining table while the doctor inserts the flexible tube (about the thickness of a finger) into your anus and rectum and slowly directs it up through the lower colon. You may feel some discomfort, such as pressure and slight cramping in your lower abdomen. The procedure takes about 5 to 10 minutes.\n\n[Terrorism > Blood Tests]\nDoctors order blood tests for a number of reasons. By taking a sample of blood and having it evaluated in a laboratory, a doctor can learn if you are susceptible to developing a particular disorder or can determine the cause of an existing disorder and how to treat it. Many factors, such as taking prescription or nonprescription medications, drinking alcohol, or eating before the test, can affect the test results. You will be given instructions on how to prepare for a blood test.\n\n[Terrorism > Blood Tests > *Complete Blood Cell Count*]\nA doctor takes a complete blood cell (CBC) count to check the quantity and quality of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets—three major types of cells in the blood. A CBC count consists of six different tests.\n\n[Terrorism > Blood Tests > *Complete Blood Cell Count* > Red blood cell count]\nThe red blood cell (RBC) count is used to determine if the level of red cells (which transport oxygen to tissues) in the blood is too high or too low. Extremely high levels of red blood cells may be a sign of a blood disorder such as polycythemia; extremely low levels may be a sign of anemia.\n\n[Terrorism > Blood Tests > Routine Vaccinations for Adults]\nIn addition to periodic health checkups and screening tests, your doctor will probably recommend that you have vaccinations against some potentially dangerous infectious diseases.

Increased levels of triglycerides or LDL cholesterol and decreased levels of HDL cholesterol can indicate an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart disease, atherosclerosis, and stroke. Doctors use the cholesterol test to evaluate heart disease risk. Drugs such as corticosteroids, thiazide diuretics, and oral contraceptives can affect cholesterol levels. Excess alcohol intake, kidney and liver diseases, obesity, menopause, diabetes, and hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland) also can affect cholesterol and lipid levels.\n\n[Terrorism > Glucose]\nGlucose is a sugar that the body uses for energy. The hormone insulin, which is produced by the pancreas, regulates the level of glucose in the blood. Increased levels of glucose can be a sign of diabetes. Decreased levels of glucose can be a sign of adrenal insufficiency (underfunctioning of the adrenal glands). Conditions such as a stroke or heart attack can temporarily increase glucose levels. Medications such as corticosteroids, diuretics, and tricyclic antidepressants also can increase glucose levels. In general, low blood glucose is a rare condition in people who are otherwise healthy. The normal glucose range is 65 to 109 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).\n\n[Terrorism > Albumin]\nThe albumin test measures the amount in the blood of the protein albumin, which keeps water inside blood vessels and is the most plentiful protein in the body. The albumin level is a good indicator of a person's general nutritional status. Disorders such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and malnutrition can cause a decrease in the level of albumin. The level of albumin is also decreased during pregnancy. The albumin test can help diagnose liver disease, kidney disease, and intestinal disorders such as Crohn's disease that can reduce the absorption of nutrients. People who have cancer or chronic diseases\n\nsuch as autoimmune disorders or AIDS often have a low albumin level. The normal albumin range is 3.7 to 5.2 grams per deciliter (g/dL).\n\n[Terrorism > Albumin > Alkaline phosphatase]\nAlkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme that is present in all tissues of the body. High concentrations of ALP are normally found in the liver, in bile ducts, in bones, and, in pregnant women, in the placenta. Extremely high levels of ALP can be a sign of several abnormal conditions, including bone disease, leukemia, and liver disease. The enzyme can also be elevated in normal conditions such as healthy bone growth or can result from an abnormal response to a medication. The normal ALP range is 40 to 157 international units per liter (IU/L).\n\n[Terrorism > Albumin > Alanine aminotransferase]\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) is an enzyme found in many tissues, but is present in high levels in the liver.

Most women who have ovarian cancer have an elevated level of CA-125 in their blood. However, this test is not used as a screening test for ovarian cancer or to make a definite diagnosis of ovarian cancer because levels of CA-125 also can be elevated in noncancerous conditions such as inflammation in the abdomen, pelvic infections, uterine fibroids, ovarian cysts, endometriosis, and liver diseases such as hepatitis and cirrhosis. The CA-125 test is often used, usually along with other tests, to monitor the effectiveness of treatment of ovarian cancer in women who are undergoing chemotherapy.\n\nA CA-125 level below 35 units per milliliter (U/mL) is considered normal. If your level of CA-125 is higher than normal, your doctor will recommend further tests, such as a vaginal ultrasound (see page 510), to make a diagnosis.\n\n[Terrorism > Albumin > *Thyroid Hormones*]\nThe thyroid gland produces two thyroid hormones, called thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which can be measured in the blood to help doctors evaluate thyroid function. The thyroid's hormone production is triggered by secretion of a hormone called thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) by the pituitary gland in the brain. Doctors usually use a combination of two or more tests to diagnose thyroid disorders. For example, a high level of TSH and a low level of T4 can indicate an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). An abnormally low level of TSH and high level of T4 can indicate an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). The normal range for total\n\nT4 is 4.6 to 12 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL). The normal range for total T3 is 80 to 180 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL). The normal range for TSH is 0.5 to 6 microunits per milliliter (mcU/mL).\n\n[Terrorism > Urine Tests]\nDoctors use urine tests to evaluate urine for signs of infection in the kidneys or bladder, or for the presence of blood or other substances. A person may have a urine test for a number of reasons, including as part of an annual physical examination, before surgery, to diagnose a urinary tract infection, and to confirm and monitor a pregnancy. A urine sample can be taken at the doctor's office or at home (and brought to the doctor's office).\n\nIt is essential for urine samples to be taken under clean conditions. Before having a urine test, you will be asked to wash your genital area to make sure that the urine is not contaminated by bacteria that normally live on the skin. You will be given a clean container in which to urinate. To get a midstream or clean-catch urine sample, you will be asked to urinate into the toilet for a few seconds before urinating into the container.\n\n[Terrorism > Urine Tests > *Urinealysis*]\nA doctor performs a urinalysis to diagnose or monitor conditions that affect the kidneys, such as kidney disease or diabetes. The doctor will use a test strip to check for specific suspected abnormalities, such as the presence of bacteria. The sample is also examined more closely under a microscope to look for bacteria or other microorganisms and for specific substances, such as mucus, red blood cells, or white blood cells that can be signs of health problems.\n\n[Terrorism > Urine Tests > *Urine Culture*]\nDoctors perform urine cultures to diagnose urinary tract infections. After the urine is collected, a sample is put on a slide in the laboratory and placed in an incubator for 24 hours. If bacteria, yeast, or other microorganisms grow on the sample, the test result is considered positive. The sample is then tested with various drugs to determine what medication to use to treat the infection.\n\n[Terrorism > First Aid]\nThe main goal of first aid is to help an injured (or, in some cases, ill) person recover or to prevent an injury from getting worse. The person giving first aid should also provide reassurance and make the person as comfortable as possible until professional help arrives. For many minor injuries, first aid may be all that is needed. More serious injuries may require medical attention and further treatment.\n\nThe more knowledge you have before an injury or emergency occurs, the more helpful you can be. Review this section and familiarize yourself with first-aid techniques and procedures. Some topics such as allergic reactions (see page 912), asthma attacks (see page 640), seizures (see page 686), and diabetic coma (see page 897) are covered in other sections of the book. Sports injuries and the standard treatment for most athletic injuries are covered on pages 978 to 982.\n\nMake a practice run to the nearest hospital emergency department so you know the best route in case you have to drive an injured person there yourself.

AEDs are increasingly being made available in public places such as airports, schools, and shopping malls. They are intended for use by nonmedical personnel and can be used by anyone without prior training (although AED classes are\n\navailable in most communities). The devices come with written and audio instructions. An AED is easier to use and more effective than cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\n\nThe AED first checks the person's heart rhythm to determine if a shock is needed. The AED will not administer a shock unless the person needs it. In addition, the AED will work even if the pads aren't placed in the exact position. Always ask if an AED is available if you think someone may be having or may have had a heart attack.\n\nSymptoms of a heart attack include constant pain (which may last several minutes) or a sensation of tightness or pressure in the center of the chest; chest pain or discomfort that moves from the chest to an arm or shoulder or to the neck, jaw, back, or abdomen; profuse sweating; nausea or vomiting; anxiety; pale skin or bluish nails or lips; weakness; dizziness; and difficulty breathing.\n\n**If you think someone may be having a heart attack:**\n\n1. Call or have someone call 911 or your local emergency number, or send someone for help. Tell emergency personnel that the person may be having a heart attack.\n2. Find out if there is an automated external defibrillator (AED) available where you are. Take the person immediately to the nearest hospital emergency department after following steps 3, 4, or 5 below.\n3. *If the person is conscious*, help the person into a comfortable sitting position (lying down may make breathing difficult) and (if the person is not allergic to aspirin) give him or her an aspirin. Chewable aspirin is best, but you can have him or her chew a regular aspirin. Don't give him or her anything else to eat or drink. Loosen any tight clothing and keep the person calm, comfortable, and warm.\n4. *If the person is unconscious and not breathing and an AED is not available*, start CPR if you have had CPR training. Start mouth-to-mouth resuscitation immediately (see page 156) until breathing has been restored or until medical help arrives.\n5. *If the person is unconscious and not breathing and an AED is available*, open the person's clothing and place the electrode pads on the person's chest as directed on the machine—one pad on the person's upper right side (between the nipple and collarbone) and the other pad on the person's lower left side (just below the armpit). Make sure no one (including the person administering the defibrillator) is touching the person. Press the “analyze” button on the machine,\n\nwhich checks to see if a shock should be administered. If the defibrillator says to give the person a shock, again make sure no one is touching the person, and press the “shock” button. Repeat this sequence (of pressing the analyze and shock buttons) up to three times if necessary. If there is still no pulse, start CPR if you have had CPR training.\n\n[Terrorism > Unconsciousness]\nWhen a person is unconscious, the body's normal reflexes are not functioning. The person will not respond to attempts to rouse him or her. The main danger when a person is unconscious is obstruction of the airway, which can result when the tongue or some other object such as food or vomit blocks the airway. Some causes of unconsciousness include heart attack (see previous page), stroke (see page 669), head injury (see page 167), severe bleeding (see next page), severe burn (see page 163, diabetic coma (hypoglycemia; see page 897), broken bones (see page 167), poisoning (see page 169), drug overdose, heatstroke (see page 166), choking (see page 155), a severe allergic reaction to food or to an insect bite or sting (see page 170), snakebite (see page 172), and an electric shock or lightning strike (see page 163).\n\nCall or have someone call 911 or your local emergency number, or send someone for help. If you can't call or send for help, take the person immediately to the nearest hospital emergency department. Do not leave an unconscious person alone.\n\n[Terrorism > How to Treat a Person Who Is Unconscious]\n*If the person is not breathing:*\n\n1. Start mouth-to-mouth resuscitation immediately (see page 156). If the person has no heartbeat, perform CPR if you have had CPR training.\n\n*If the person is breathing:*\n\n1. Don't move the person, especially if you think he or she may have a neck or back injury.\n2. If you are sure that the person does not have a neck or back injury, place him or her on his or her side (to prevent choking), with the head tilted back slightly (to open the airway) and lower than the rest of the body (to drain fluids).\n3.

Try to make the dressing airtight using tape or another\n\nadhesive. If you don't have tape, place a hand on each side of the wound and firmly push the skin together to close the wound.\n\n1. If the wound seems to be sucking in air, seal the wound after the person has exhaled, but leave one corner untaped, which will prevent air from being trapped in the chest cavity and pressing on the collapsed lung.\n2. Lay the person down with the head and shoulders raised and the body leaning slightly toward the injured side.\n3. Don't give the person anything to eat or drink.\n\n[Terrorism > Shock]\nShock is a life-threatening reduction in the flow of blood to body tissues. Shock usually results from a serious illness or injury, such as a heart attack (see page 157), spinal injury (see page 167), severe bleeding (see page 159), severe burn (see next page), poisoning (see page 169), or a severe allergic reaction (see page 916).\n\nA person who is in shock looks pale and sweaty; has cool, moist skin and a weak, rapid pulse; and acts confused.

If the burn is more severe or extensive (for example, it covers the entire chest), don't put anything cold on it (you could lower the person's body temperature to a dangerous level). Instead, cover the person with a clean blanket.\n3. Do not give the person anything to eat or drink.

New skin forms under a blister, and the fluid inside the blister is gradually absorbed; eventually the outer skin layer comes off. First aid is needed only if the blister breaks or if the raw skin area is likely to be damaged by friction, which can lead to pain and infection.\n\n[Terrorism > Elevate a burned arm, leg, hand, or foot > Blisters > **To treat a blister:**]\n1. Gently wash the blister and surrounding area with soap and water. Do not prick the blister or try to remove it.\n2. Cover the blister with a sterile gauze pad and tape the pad in place.\n3. If the blister was caused by a chemical, is larger than 2 inches across, or occurs on the hands, face (especially around the mouth and nose), or genitals, see your doctor.\n\n[Terrorism > **Hypothermia**]\nHypothermia is a drop in internal body temperature below 95°F. Hypothermia usually occurs from prolonged exposure to extreme cold or after submersion in cold water, although it can occur in relatively warm water if the water temperature is lower than body temperature and exposure is long enough. During prolonged exposure to extreme cold, more body heat is lost than can be replaced, and body temperature drops. In young, healthy people, hypothermia occurs only after extreme, prolonged exposure. In older people and very young children, hypothermia occurs faster and more easily.\n\nThe drop in body temperature may not be noticeable at first but can cause clumsiness, irritability, slurred speech, confusion, and drowsiness as a person's physical and mental abilities slow. Breathing and heartbeat become weaker and slower, and the person may eventually go into a coma and die.\n\n[Terrorism > **Hypothermia** > **To treat hypothermia:**]\n1. Call or have someone call 911 or your local emergency number, or send someone for help.\n2. If the person's breathing has stopped, start mouth-to-mouth resuscitation immediately (see page 156). If there is no heartbeat, perform CPR if you have had CPR training.\n3. Have the person lie down, and keep him or her as still as possible, which reduces the risk of a dangerous drop in blood pressure or heart rhythm abnormalities that can occur when cold blood returns to the heart from the extremities.\n\n1. If outside, shelter the person from the cold and wind in any way you can. Insulate him or her from the ground to prevent further heat loss. Cover him or her with warm, dry clothing and blankets, and make sure his or her head is covered. Use your own body to provide additional warmth.\n2. If you can, bring the person into a warm room. Remove any wet clothing. Do not overheat the person too quickly by placing him or her in front of a heater. Rewarming the body too quickly can cause a rush of blood to the body's surface and a drop in internal body temperature when cold blood from the arms and legs returns to the heart and brain.\n3. If the person is conscious, give him or her a warm (not hot) beverage such as broth or warm water with lemon or honey or gelatin dissolved in it. Do not give the person alcohol, beverages that contain caffeine (such as tea, coffee, or hot chocolate), or cigarettes. Alcohol can restrict blood flow to the extremities and inhibit the shivering mechanism, which helps warm the body. Caffeine accelerates the symptoms of hypothermia and can cause the heart to beat faster, possibly causing heart-rhythm abnormalities.

They are extremely harmful, and possibly fatal, if swallowed. Keep them in correctly labeled childproof containers, and store them out of the reach of children.\n\n- Antifreeze\n- Cigarettes and other forms of tobacco\n- Cosmetics, colognes, or perfumes\n- Drugs of any kind\n- Gardening products such as fertilizer, fungicide, or weed killer\n- Household cleaners such as bleach, dishwasher and dishwashing detergent, drain cleaner, furniture polish, glass cleaner, grease remover, laundry detergent, oven cleaner, scouring powder, or toilet bowl cleaner\n- Insecticides\n- Liquor\n- Nail polish and removers\n\n- Paint and paint thinner\n- Certain plants (such as dieffenbachia, philodendrons, and spider plants)\n\n[Terrorism > Poisonous Plants]\nSome plants can cause an allergic reaction or direct chemical reaction on the skin, such as a burn or a blister. Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac are three of the most common plants that cause this reaction in susceptible people. When a person touches a poisonous plant (or touches clothing or a pet that has been in contact with the plant), an oily substance on the leaves gets on the skin and can cause an itchy, oozing rash (see color illustration on page 120). The rash can be easily spread to other parts of the body. The smoke from burning poison ivy, oak, or sumac can cause skin irritation and, if inhaled, can cause severe wheezing or difficulty breathing.\n\nAn over-the-counter lotion containing bentoquatam (which blocks the irritating oil that causes the allergic reaction) can be applied before a potential exposure to prevent or reduce an allergic skin reaction. It should be applied at least 15 minutes before the possible exposure (and every 4 hours after), and the skin should be washed after exposure even if the lotion was applied. The medication will not stop or prevent a reaction if applied after exposure.\n\n[Terrorism > Poisonous Plants > To treat poison ivy, oak, or sumac:]\n1. Wear gloves if you are helping someone who has been exposed to a poisonous plant remove his or her clothing.\n2. Wash the skin and clean the fingernails immediately (within 15 minutes) with mild soap and water to remove the oily plant substance.\n3. Apply cool packs to the affected areas.\n4. Tell the person not to scratch or rub the affected areas; scratching can worsen or spread the rash.\n5. Take frequent warm (not hot) showers or oatmeal baths, apply calamine lotion or topical corticosteroids to the affected areas, and take oral antihistamines or over-the-counter pain relievers to help relieve itching.\n6. Wash clothing thoroughly, using warm water and a laundry detergent that can remove oil.\n7. If the reaction is severe or if the rash is on the person's face (especially around the eyes or mouth) or genitals, get medical attention right away.\n\n[Terrorism > Insect Stings]\nInsect stings cause more deaths per year than snakebites, but most insect stings cause only mild reactions, such as redness and swelling. Some stings can be life-threatening and cause anaphylactic shock (see page 916) if a person is allergic to the insect's venom. The most common stinging insects are honeybees, hornets, wasps, yellow jackets, bumblebees, and fire ants. Only honeybees leave a stinger in the skin.\n\nSome symptoms of insect stings are pain, swelling, redness, itching, and burning. Multiple insect stings can cause rapid swelling, headache, muscle cramps, fever, and drowsiness. Severe allergic reactions to insect stings include severe swelling and itching (including in areas of the body away from the sting), hives, coughing or wheezing, difficulty breathing, stomach cramps, nausea and vomiting, weakness, dizziness, bluish skin color, and unconsciousness.\n\n[Terrorism > Insect Stings > To treat a severe allergic reaction to an insect sting:]\n1. If the person seems to be having a severe allergic reaction, call or have someone call 911 or your local emergency number, or send someone for help. If the person has an anaphylaxis kit, help him or her administer a shot of epinephrine (adrenaline); if he or she is unable to administer the injection, give it to him or her yourself by following the instructions on the kit.\n2.

Rattlesnakes are responsible for two out of three poisonous snakebites and are found all over the United States. Cottonmouth and copperhead snakes are found primarily in the Southeast and South Central United States. Coral snakes are found in the Southeast.\n\nIt is important to know whether a snake is poisonous. Poisonous, or venomous, snakes have a triangular-shaped head, while nonvenomous snakes have a more rounded\n\nhead. Pit vipers such as the rattlesnake, copperhead, and cottonmouth have pits (which look like another set of nostrils) between their nostrils and their slitlike eyes. Rattlesnakes have a rattle at the end of their tail. Cottonmouths have a white lining in their mouth. Copperheads have a copper-colored head and a pinkish gray body with a brown hourglass shape on the skin.\n\nThe symptoms of a pit viper bite include severe pain, rapid swelling, discoloration, and redness at the site of the bite. The person may also experience weakness, nausea and vomiting, blurred vision, seizures, numbness in the arms and legs, and difficulty breathing.\n\n[Terrorism > Snakebites > Top view of a pit viper]\nPit vipers such as rattlesnakes, cottonmouths, and copperheads have a triangular head when viewed from above (left).

They have round eyes and a black nose and alternating rings of red, yellow, and black (the narrow yellow rings always separate the red rings from the black). All poisonous snakes have long fangs.\n\nSymptoms of a coral snake bite include slight pain and swelling at the site of the bite, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, difficulty speaking or swallowing, drooling, drowsiness, sweating, nausea and vomiting, confusion, weakness, dizziness, joint pain, paralysis, and difficulty breathing.\n\nIf there is no swelling within 4 hours (for a pit viper bite) and 6 hours (for a coral snake bite), the snake was probably not poisonous.\n\n[Terrorism > Snakebites > If someone has been bitten by a poisonous snake:]\n1. Call 911 or your local emergency number or the national poison center (1-800-222-1222). Do not try to suck out the venom (you could poison yourself).\n\n1. If the person is not breathing, start mouth-to-mouth resuscitation immediately (see page 156). If the person's heart has stopped, perform CPR if you have had CPR training.\n2. If a snakebite kit is available, immediately use the suction cups from the kit to draw out body fluids containing the venom.\n3. Keep the person calm, which will slow circulation and help stop the spread of the venom.\n4. Remove any jewelry.\n5. Immobilize the bitten arm or leg, and keep it below the level of the heart. Keep the person calm, and do not let him or her walk.\n6. Wash the bite area thoroughly. Do not apply ice or very cold water; it could damage the skin. Cover the bite with a sterile dressing.\n7. If the person is not nauseated or vomiting, is not having seizures, and is conscious, give him or her small sips of water. Do not give alcoholic beverages.\n8. If you can safely capture and kill the snake (preferably without damaging its head), take it with you to the emergency department. Do not handle the head. The severed head of a snake can inject poison for up to an hour after the snake has died. If you cannot bring the snake with you to the doctor, try to describe the snake.\n\n[Terrorism > Identifying pit vipers]\nPoisonous snakes such as pit vipers have long fangs, slitlike eyes, and pits that contain sacs of poison between their eyes and their nostrils.\n\n![Diagram of a snake showing key features: Slitlike eyes, Nostril, Pit, and Fang.]()![](_page_376_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n[Terrorism > Animal Bites]\nBites from a domesticated animal (such as a dog or cat) or a wild animal (such as a squirrel or raccoon) can result in serious infection and tissue damage.

The discoloration and swelling in the skin are caused by blood seeping into the tissues. The skin will usually turn colors—from reddish blue, to green and yellow, to brown—before fading. Bruises usually disappear without treatment after 10 to 14 days.\n\nBruises on the head or shin or around the eye (a black eye) may swell significantly because bone is just beneath the skin and there is little fatty tissue to cushion the blow. If a bruise does not fade or disappear completely or if it becomes painful and swollen, or if bruises continue to appear for no reason, see your doctor. You may have a broken bone or other injury or a blood-clotting disorder.\n\n[Terrorism > Bruises > To treat a bruise:]\n1. Gently apply an ice pack or a cold, wet cloth to the bruise to reduce bleeding, pain, and swelling. Don't apply too much pressure.\n2. If the bruise is on an arm or leg, elevate it above the level of the heart to decrease blood flow to the area.\n3. After 24 hours, apply a warm washcloth or a heating pad to aid healing.\n\n[Terrorism > WARNING! > Unusual Bruises]\nYou should suspect that someone (especially a child or an incapacitated or older person) has been a victim of abuse if he or she has any of the following signs:\n\n- Bruises on fleshy areas such as the face, back, abdomen, thighs, or buttocks\n- Bruises in generally protected areas such as the neck (possibly from choking), chest, or genitals\n\n- Bruises with distinctive and recognizable shapes of objects such as clothes hangers or belt buckles\n- Multiple bruises in various stages of healing\n\n[Terrorism > Splinters]\nA small splinter usually can be removed easily with tweezers. A splinter in the eye should be removed only by a doctor. If a splinter breaks off in the skin, is deeply lodged, or cannot be removed, see your doctor as soon as possible. You should also see a doctor if the wound becomes infected or if red streaks radiate from the wound (which is a sign that the infection is spreading in the bloodstream).\n\n[Terrorism > Splinters > To remove a splinter from the skin:]\n1. Wash your hands and the skin around the splinter with soap and water.\n2. Sterilize tweezers (and any other instrument you may need, such as a needle or razor blade) with rubbing alcohol or by placing them over an open flame or in boiling water and letting them cool. If the splinter is sticking out of the skin, place the open tweezers directly on the skin on either side of the splinter (pushing on the skin slightly), and gently pull on the splinter in the direction in which it entered the skin.\n3. If the splinter is embedded just under the skin, gently loosen the skin around the splinter with a sterilized needle or the tip of a sterilized razor blade. Lift the end of the splinter with the end of the needle or tip of the razor blade. Carefully remove all of the splinter with the sterilized tweezers.\n4. Squeeze the wound gently to promote slight bleeding, which will force out some of the germs.\n5. Wash the area with soap and water, and apply a bandage.\n\n[Terrorism > Foreign Object in the Eye]\nNever try to remove anything that is stuck in the eye or is on the pupil of the eye. If a person has something embedded in his or her eye, do not let the person rub it. Gently cover both eyes with a sterile compress and lightly bandage it in place. Covering both eyes helps stop eye movement, which can help minimize eye damage and pain. Call 911 or your local emergency number, or get the person to a hospital emergency department immediately.\n\nIf an object such as a piece of dirt or an eyelash is floating on the white or inside corner of the eye or on the inside of the eyelid, you can try to remove it. Symptoms of something in the eye include pain, a burning sensation, tearing, redness, or sensitivity to light.\n\n**To remove a foreign object that is not embedded in the eye:**\n\n1. Wash your hands with soap and water.\n2. If the person is wearing contact lenses, remove (or have the person remove) the lenses if they can be removed easily.\n3. Gently pull the upper eyelid out and down over the lower eyelid, and hold the upper lid down for a few seconds. This should cause tears to flow, which may wash out the particle. The upper lid sliding over the lower lid also may dislodge the particle.\n\n**Pull the upper eyelid over the lower eyelid**\n\n![Illustration showing a hand gently pulling the upper eyelid down over the lower eyelid, demonstrating the technique to pull the upper eyelid over the lower eyelid.]()![](_page_382_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\n1.

If the woman's contractions are about 2 minutes apart, if she feels like pushing, or if the baby's head is visible in the vaginal opening, birth will usually occur very soon.\n\nChildbirth is a natural process, and most deliveries do not have complications. However, delivery is bloody. Call or have someone call 911 or your local emergency number, or send someone for help. Try to get the woman to the nearest hospital emergency department if possible. If not, a doctor may be able to give you instructions over the phone. Do not try to delay or prevent the birth by crossing the woman's legs or pushing on the baby's head, which can seriously harm the baby.\n\n[Terrorism > Foreign Object in the Eye > **To help deliver a baby:**]\n1. Put clean sheets on a bed (with a rubber sheet or shower curtain underneath if possible). If a bed is not available, place clean clothing or newspapers under\n\nthe woman or at least under her hips and thighs.

Make the woman as comfortable as possible.\n2. Wash your hands with soap and water. Sterilize the scissors or knife with rubbing alcohol, or place them in boiling water for at least 5 minutes or over an open flame for 30 seconds and cool them before using them.\n3. Have the woman lie on her back with her knees bent, feet flat, and knees and thighs wide apart.\n4.

Once the head has emerged, if you can feel or see that the umbilical cord is around the baby's neck, quickly but gently slip the cord over the baby's head. If the cord is wrapped around the neck too tightly, cut the cord immediately and tie off the ends (see step 14). If the cord is not wrapped around the neck, do not cut it at this time.\n2. Continue to support the head as the shoulders emerge, but don't pull the baby out (even by the armpits). Carefully hold the baby as the rest of his or her body comes out.\n3. After delivery, if you can, note the time.\n\n1. Support the baby's head and body with one hand while grasping the baby's legs and ankles with the other (get a firm grip because the baby will be very slippery). Position the baby so that his or her head is lower than the feet to allow any membranes or fluid to drain from the baby's lungs, mouth, and nose. Do not hold the baby completely upside down by the ankles or slap or hit him or her.\n2. Gently wipe any fluid or membranes out of the baby's mouth and nose (preferably with a sterile gauze or clean cloth).\n\n[Terrorism > Foreign Object in the Eye > Wipe fluid or membranes from the mouth and nose]\n![Illustration of a healthcare provider gently wiping the mouth and nose of a baby.]()![](_page_390_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\n1. If the baby has not cried or is not breathing, gently rub his or her chest, or tap the bottoms of the feet. If the baby still is not breathing, perform artificial respiration (see page 156).\n2. Once the baby has started breathing, wrap him or her up snugly (including the top of the head). Do not clean the cheesy white coating from the baby's skin, eyes, or ears (it is a protective covering).\n3. If the woman can be taken to a hospital immediately after the delivery of the placenta (which occurs about 5 to 20 minutes after delivery), the baby can be left attached to the cord and placenta.\n4. If you must cut the umbilical cord, do not cut or tie it until it has stopped pulsating. Using a string, shoelace, cord, or cloth, tie a tight knot in the umbilical cord at least 4 inches from the baby's navel and then tie another knot 6 to 8 inches away from the baby.

In some cases, the person needs the expertise and training of a registered nurse or other professional caregiver.\n\nBut with proper training and guidance, you will learn to perform the required tasks on your own. Always call on the experience of professionals whenever you need to.\n\n[Terrorism > Giving Medications]\nLearn all you can about the person's medications, starting with the names of the drugs. If he or she is taking several medications, keep a list of their names and a written schedule of the daily doses of each so that you can check off each dose as you give it. Get the instructions about each prescribed medication from your doctor or pharmacist, and\n\nmake sure you understand them. Read the package insert that comes with each medication. You may want to ask the doctor or pharmacist the following questions:\n\n- When should the medication be taken (with meals, first thing in the morning, at bedtime, or two or more times a day)?\n- How long should the medication be taken? Will refills be necessary?\n- What are the possible side effects? What should be done about them?\n- Does the medication interact with any other drugs that the person is taking?\n- Should the person avoid certain foods?\n- Does the medication have lasting effects?\n- Does the medication have any warnings?\n- Does the medication come in various forms? For example, if the person has problems swallowing pills, ask if the medication is available as a liquid.\n\nRemember that all medications must be taken exactly as prescribed by the doctor. Never stop giving medication without the doctor's permission.\n\n[Terrorism > WARNING! > Allergic Reactions and Unpleasant Side Effects]\nSome medications can cause an allergic reaction (producing symptoms such as hives, itching, a rash, or wheezing) or side effects (such as nausea or dizziness). If the person develops any of these symptoms, call the doctor immediately to find out if you should stop giving the medication. The doctor may need to adjust the dosage or change medications.\n\n[Terrorism > WARNING! > Providing a Healthy Diet]\nHealthy eating is essential for maintaining the person's health and well-being and also can promote successful recovery. If the doctor has not prescribed a special diet for the person, you can provide the foods that he or she normally eats.\n\nAdequate fluid intake also is an important part of a healthy diet. Most people should drink at least eight glasses of fluid every day, including water, milk, juice, broth, or caffeine-free coffee, tea, or soft drinks. If the doctor limits the person's daily fluid intake, follow the doctor's instructions.\n\nThe following tips can make it easier for the person to consume a healthful diet. Adapt them to the person's needs:\n\n- Slice, dice, chop, mash, or purée foods to make them easier to chew and swallow.\n- Look for ways to add calories and nutrients to the diet of a person who is at risk for weight loss. For example, fortified milk shakes can be tasty and nutritious. Ask your doctor if the person you are caring for could benefit from nutritional supplements that provide added nutrients and calories.\n- People with decreased appetites may consume more calories by eating five or six smaller meals throughout the day rather than three large meals.\n- Ask the person what foods he or she likes or dislikes.\n- Make meals look attractive.\n- Eat meals together whenever possible. Mealtime rituals can be comforting and can help restore a sense of normalcy to a person's life.\n- If a stroke has paralyzed one side of a person's body, food may tend to collect in the paralyzed cheek. If this occurs, gently knead the cheek with your finger while the person is chewing, to help move the food along.\n- If the person is able to exercise, encourage and help him or her to do so. Regular exercise stimulates the appetite and helps prevent constipation. Ask the doctor which exercises are best.\n\n[Terrorism > *Assisting With Eating*]\nIf the person cannot feed himself or herself, you must feed him or her. Cut food into small, bite-size pieces, or purée it to make it easy to chew and swallow. Before feeding the person, be sure he or she is sitting upright in a comfortable position. Tuck a napkin or hand towel under the chin to catch any spills. Taste the food to be sure it is not too hot. Because feeding someone can be a lengthy process, keep the food warm in a warming dish.\n\nIf the person cannot chew or swallow—because of oral radiation treatments, jaw injury, or stroke, for example—you may need to provide nutrition through a feeding tube or intravenously (directly into a vein). The doctor or nurse will teach you how to do this correctly and safely. Watch closely for any signs of infection: pain, redness, or swelling at the insertion site of the intravenous needle or feeding tube, or fever.\n\nGood oral hygiene is essential", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "medications", "relation": "treats", "tail": "needs"}, {"head": "registered nurse", "relation": "provides", "tail": "expertise"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "patient", "relation": "participates in", "tail": "[Event: clinical trial]"}, {"head": "caregiver", "relation": "performs", "tail": "[Event: giving medications]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

Place a large towel under the person to protect the bedding before bringing him or her a basin of warm water, mild soap, and a washcloth. Be sure that the room is warm, and provide another large towel to drape over the person for warmth and privacy. The person should give himself or herself a sponge bath once a day.\n\nIf the person you are caring for is unable to bathe without help, you can give him or her a bath in bed. Although giving a bed bath presents its own challenges, it is not a difficult task to perform once you have mastered the routine. Make sure that the room is warm before undressing the person, taking care to provide as much privacy as possible. Cover him or her with a large towel and place another towel underneath to protect the bedding. Before you begin, check the water to make sure it is at a comfortable temperature. When you use soap, make sure it is a mild soap that will not dry out or irritate the person's skin.\n\nAs you bathe the person, look carefully for sores, rashes, or other skin problems. If the person is recovering from surgery, be sure to examine the incision carefully to make sure it is healing properly. Some indications of possible infection include fever; redness, pain, and swelling around the incision; and pus. It is important to report any of these signs to the doctor or nurse immediately.\n\nWhen giving a bed bath, wash and dry one area of the person's body at a time, uncovering only the part of the body you are washing. This helps keep the person warm and maintains a sense of privacy.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n1. Use plain water to bathe the person, starting at the head. Use soap only in sweaty areas (such as the armpits, groin, and buttocks); wash between skin folds. Be thorough but gentle. Change the water as needed.\n2. Gently pat the person dry with a fresh, soft towel; don't rub.\n3. Roll the person onto one side to wash and dry his or her back.\n4. Let the person dip his or her hands into a basin of fresh water. This is more refreshing than having the hands wiped with a washcloth.\n5. Before helping the person dress, make sure that every area of his or her body is thoroughly dry. Provide or apply deodorant, lotion, or body powder as needed.\n\n[Terrorism > Bathing > Helping With Toileting Needs]\nBladder and bowel movements can be difficult for people who cannot use the toilet. A person who is confined to bed will need to use a bedpan or commode; a man may be able to use a handheld urinal. If a person cannot use these devices, he or she may need to wear absorbent disposable briefs. Always give the person complete privacy.\n\nIf the person cannot wipe after urinating or having a bowel movement, you will need to do it for him or her. Keeping the genital and anal areas clean helps prevent the skin from breaking down. Always wipe a woman or girl gently from front to back (from the vagina to the anus) to ensure that bacteria do not enter the vagina or urinary tract and cause infection.\n\nSome caregivers need to give an enema (by injecting a liquid into the rectum) to relieve constipation (see page 769) or an accumulation of hardened feces in the rectum (fecal impaction). If the person has an indwelling catheter (a plastic tube inserted directly into the bladder) that drains urine into a bag, you will need to empty and clean the bag regularly. (A doctor or other health care professional will change the catheter periodically.) Learn to perform these tasks correctly from a trained health care professional. Ask for clear, precise instructions.\n\n[Terrorism > Bathing > *Using a Commode*]\nIf the person is able to get out of bed for brief periods, using a bedside commode may be easiest. Assist the person out of bed and onto the commode. If necessary, help the person wipe himself or herself, and then help him or her back into bed. Empty the removable pan into the toilet. Rinse the pan out, clean it thoroughly with a household disinfectant diluted with water, and return it to the commode.\n\n[Terrorism > *Using a Bedpan*]\nA person who is confined to bed will need to use a bedpan, which can be awkward. In addition to giving the person privacy, be sure to give him or her plenty of time. A person who is embarrassed about using a bedpan or who feels pressured while using one may be reluctant to ask for it when he or she needs it. Resisting the urge to have a bowel movement can lead to constipation and fecal impaction. Remember to ask the person frequently if he or she needs to use the bedpan—and keep it within easy reach and in the same place so it can be found quickly when needed.\n\nBefore giving the person a bedpan, sprinkle a small amount of body powder on the rim of the bedpan to make it easier to slip under the buttocks. The open end of the bedpan should always be toward the person's feet.

In older people, early detection and treatment of depression are extremely important because of the high risk of suicide. If you notice that the person you are caring for has any of the following signs or symptoms for more than a few days, talk to his or her doctor immediately:\n\n- Changes in appetite (decrease or increase)\n- Weight loss or weight gain\n- Changes in mood or emotions\n- Lack of responsiveness or attentiveness\n- Loss of interest in favorite activities\n- Feelings of hopelessness or helplessness\n\nSome people incorrectly assume that symptoms of depression are a normal part of aging or mistake symptoms of depression for Alzheimer's disease (see page 688), dementia (see page 689), or another illness. If the diagnosis is depression, it can be successfully treated with medication, psychotherapy, or a combination of both, at any age.\n\n[Terrorism > *Fever*]\nAlthough a fever is not usually dangerous, notify the person's doctor if the person you are caring for has a fever. Always check with the person's doctor before giving aspirin or an aspirin substitute. The doctor may prescribe a medication to reduce the fever. If the person's temperature continues to rise after he or she has been given medication to reduce it, call his or her doctor immediately. Never try to raise the temperature of a\n\nperson who has a fever (such as by turning up the heat or putting extra blankets or other coverings on him or her). Raising a person's temperature abnormally high can cause seizures or loss of consciousness.\n\nTo help reduce the person's temperature, sponge his or her face, neck, trunk, arms, and legs with lukewarm water and let it evaporate on the skin. Evaporation brings down the temperature of the skin. Encourage the person to drink plenty of water, a sports drink, fruit juice, or broth to replace the fluids that will be lost through the excessive perspiration that accompanies a fever.\n\n[Terrorism > *Vomiting*]\nMedications and treatments such as radiation therapy can cause nausea and vomiting. However, because vomiting can also be a sign of an illness or underlying health problem, tell the doctor if the person you are caring for is vomiting, especially if he or she is vomiting repeatedly. The doctor may tell you to watch for signs of dehydration such as thirst, dry lips and mouth, dizziness, headache, confusion, muscle weakness, shakiness, and a reduced output of urine. Dehydration is a potentially dangerous condition that can lead to coma and death.\n\nIf the person is confined to bed or cannot get to a bathroom quickly, leave a container (such as a bowl or dishpan) at the bedside for him or her to vomit into. Some people want to be left alone when vomiting, while others find it comforting to have someone with them. If the person finds it reassuring, hold his or her forehead while he or she is vomiting. After the person has vomited, offer some water to rinse out his or her mouth and a bowl to spit into. Then gently wipe off his or her face using cool or lukewarm water.\n\nAs soon as the nausea ends, give sips of water, tea, ginger ale, broth, or fruit drinks to replace lost body fluids. Unless told to do so by the doctor, do not give the person solid food for several hours after he or she has stopped vomiting, and then give something that won't upset his or her stomach (such as gelatin).\n\n[Terrorism > *Memory Problems*]\nPeople of all ages can forget to call a relative on his or her birthday or leave some of the ingredients out of a favorite recipe. These types of memory problems are normal and do not interfere with the ability to function. More serious memory problems sometimes accompany aging. When an older person realizes that his or her memory is not as good\n\nas it once was, he or she may begin to feel apprehensive, fearful, and anxious. Forgetfulness may cause an older person to assume that he or she is developing dementia (see page 689) or Alzheimer's disease (see page 688). Reassure the person, and try the following strategies to help him or her remember better:\n\n- Make signs to remind the person to do things such as take medication, turn off the stove, or lock the doors. Place the signs in a visible location. Put signs along the way to the bathroom, with a sign that reads \"BATHROOM\" attached to the bathroom door.\n- Give the person a large calendar with large numbers to help him or her keep track of dates and events by checking off each day of the week.\n- Circle dates on the calendar as a reminder of important appointments and dates.\n- Provide clocks with large, easy-to-read numbers to help the person stay time-oriented.\n- Follow a regular mealtime schedule; people with memory problems often forget to eat.\n- Post a daily checklist on the refrigerator door to remind the person of the things he or she needs to do.\n- Place items to bring upstairs near the foot of the stairs (but never ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "depression", "relation": "at high risk for", "tail": "ill or disabled"}, {"head": "depression", "relation": "high risk of", "tail": "suicide"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

To prevent a fall, have the person sit up slowly and rest on the edge of the bed for a few minutes before trying to stand up. Place a sturdy chair beside the bed. When the person feels steady, stand directly in front of him or her so he or she can lean on you for support. Hold the person under the arms. Then help the person turn slowly, and gently and carefully lower him or her into the chair. As the person begins to feel stronger, have him or her try to take a few steps, using your arms for support.\n\n[Terrorism > *Increasing Circulation* > Positioning an Immobile Person in Bed]\nA person who is confined to bed often tends to slide toward the foot of the bed. To move an immobile person toward the head of the bed, you first need to help him or her to a sitting position.\n\nAn immobile person's body should always be properly positioned to help prevent deformities. Proper positioning can be achieved using pillows and bolsters. For example, when a person is lying on his or her side, instead of elevating the head of the bed, place a pillow under the upper leg and arm. And place a pillow or bolster behind\n\nthe person's back to prevent him or her from rolling backward. A person who has little fat on the hips should not be positioned fully on his or her side. Instead, position him or her in a 30-degree side-lying position to help prevent the development of pressure sores in the hip area.\n\n[Terrorism > Moving a Person in Bed]\n1. To help the person sit up in bed, first arrange the pillows so that his or her shoulders are elevated. Cross the person's arms at his or her waist. Place your hands over the person's shoulders and place your knee on the bed, next to his or her hip. Place your other foot firmly on the floor next to the bed, slightly ahead of your knee and even with the person's waist.\n\n![Illustration showing a person assisting another person in bed by placing their hands over the shoulders and using their knee and foot to help the person sit up.]()![](_page_414_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n2. Firmly grasp the person's shoulders, keeping your arms straight, and slowly move back, using your weight to pull him or her up toward you.\n\n![Illustration showing a person kneeling and supporting a seated person on a bed, demonstrating a supportive position.]()![](_page_415_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n3. If you want to move the person toward the head of the bed, keep your hand on the shoulder closer to you and get in position behind him or her. Place your knee on the bed behind the person and place your other foot firmly on the floor. Cross the person's forearms in front of his or her waist and hold them firmly from behind. Slowly move back, using your weight to pull the person toward you.\n\n![Illustration showing a person leaning over a seated person on a bed, holding the person's forearms crossed in front of the waist, demonstrating a supportive position for moving the person toward the head of the bed.]()![](_page_415_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\nAn immobile person who is confined to bed should not remain in the same position for longer than 2 hours while the caregiver is awake. Move the person from his or her side, onto his or her back, and onto the other side every 2 hours. When the immobile person is on his or her back, position a pillow under each arm and on the side of each thigh to prevent outward hip rotation. Also, place a small pillow under the knees and a footboard at the foot of the bed to keep the person's feet positioned at a right angle to the mattress. This positioning will prevent the development of footdrop (a condition in which the foot hangs limply from the ankle) and keep the person from sliding down the bed.\n\nDo not tuck sheets and blankets tightly around the person's feet and legs; keep blankets and other coverings elevated with a bed or foot cradle (a tentlike device placed at the foot of the bed). Keep bottom sheets taut to prevent them from wrinkling or gathering under the person's body, which could cause pressure sores.\n\nWhen feeding a person in bed, elevate the head of the bed at least 30 degrees to prevent choking, and keep the bed raised for at least an hour after eating. This positioning helps prevent the person from regurgitating food, which can cause him or her to accidentally breathe food into the lungs and choke. Breathing foreign particles into the lungs can lead to pneumonia.\n\n[Terrorism > Moving a Person in Bed > Moving an Immobile Person]\nWhen moving an immobile person to a chair, wheelchair, or commode, wear sturdy shoes with nonskid soles, and make sure that the person you are moving is also wearing sturdy, nonskid shoes or slippers.

Here are some things you can do:\n\n- Make sure that light switches are within easy reach of doorways so the person does not have to cross a dark room to turn on a light. Lighting that is too dim can make it difficult to see. Use high-watt bulbs but make sure they are frosted to reduce glare.\n- Place a lamp within reach of the person's bed. Put night-lights along the pathways between the bedrooms and the bathroom and a night-light in the bathroom.\n- Remove loose rugs, mats, and runners. Make sure that all other carpets and rugs have slip-resistant backing or that they are tacked down to prevent trips and slips.\n- Arrange furniture so the person has a clear, unobstructed path from one place to another. Keep hallways and stairs clear and uncluttered. Take special care with placement of furniture that has sharp or pointed corners or that is easy to bump into or fall over such as ottomans and coffee tables. Remove any furniture that is not being used. Provide a remote control for the television.\n- Keep telephone and electrical cords out of pathways.\n- Provide sturdy handrails on both sides of all stairways, 30 inches above the steps. Use nonskid treads on all bare steps. If a stairway is carpeted, make sure that the carpeting is tacked down securely on every step. Do not put loose rugs at the top or bottom of stairways. All stairways should be well lit. Do not keep toys or other items on stairs. Have an electric stair lift installed if the person can no longer climb the stairs. If there is a bathroom on the first floor, move the person's bedroom there.\n- Make sure chairs and tables are sturdy, stable, and balanced in case the person leans on them for support.\n- Set the thermostat at a warm temperature (at least 72°F) to help keep an older person's joints from stiffening. Stiff joints can lead to falls.\n- Place guardrails on the bed or a sturdy chair bedside to help the person get in and out of bed. Place a telephone with volume control and a lighted dial next to the bed.\n- Place a nonslip rubber mat on the floor in front of the sink. Clean up spills on the floor and countertops immediately. Keep frequently used items within easy reach to avoid having to bend or climb up on a chair or stepladder to reach them. Be sure that the person wears low-heeled, slip-resistant shoes that fit properly.\n- Put a nonslip rubber mat or nonslip adhesive strips on the floor of the tub or shower. Install handrails and grab bars that are attached to underlying studs on the walls around the toilet and along the bathtub. Tell the person you are caring for never to use towel\n\nbars for support—they are not strong enough. Place a nonslip bath mat on the floor outside the tub or shower. Some people find an elevated toilet seat easier to use.\n\n- Do not lock the bathroom door. It may be necessary to remove locks to prevent the person from accidentally locking himself or herself in the bathroom.\n\n- Have all medications reviewed by the person's doctor to be sure that they are necessary, especially drugs with possible side effects such as drowsiness, dizziness, or fainting.\n\n- When going outdoors, have the person wear comfortable, sturdy walking shoes with soles that grip the pavement. If he or she uses a cane or walker, make sure it is sturdy and in good condition. Encourage the person to stay indoors, if possible, when the weather is bad, especially when the pavement is wet or icy. During the winter, keep porches, steps, sidewalks, and driveways clear of snow and ice. Always spread sand or salt on icy surfaces.\n\n- A person who has difficulty walking may benefit from working with a physical therapist, either as an outpatient or through a home health care agency. If walking is a problem, talk to your doctor about having a gait evaluation and starting an exercise program to improve the person's ability to walk and increase his or her strength.\n\nIn spite of the best preventive measures, falls still may occur. If the person you are caring for falls, don't move him or her; try to determine the nature and extent of any injuries, and call for emergency medical assistance immediately.\n\n[Terrorism > Regulating Home Temperature]\nAs you age, your body becomes less able to regulate temperature. A life-threatening drop in body temperature (hypothermia; see page 165) can develop quickly in an older person if the room temperature is lower than 65°F. Make sure that the heating system in your loved one's home is in proper working order and that there is enough heat throughout the day, especially if the person lives in an apartment building, where tenants usually do not have control over the heat.

Get in the habit of asking for help as soon as you need it. Do not wait until a situation becomes unmanageable. Every member of the household should participate or contribute in some way—doing chores, running errands, preparing meals, making telephone calls, or providing company.\n\nBe ready to ask for help by keeping a list handy of all the things that need to be done. For example, ask friends or family to come over and stay with the person so you can go out. To get time on your own at home, ask them to go shopping for you or to accompany the person to the doctor's office. And do not hesitate to accept help when it's offered.\n\nIf you cannot rely on friends, neighbors, or family members, ask your doctor for a referral to a visiting nurse association, which can send a nurse to evaluate the situation and provide some needed help. Consider hiring a household helper, home health aide, or companion to help you with day-today tasks. If family members cannot give their time, perhaps they can offer financial support for help you need. Some hospitals and nursing homes have respite facilities where you can bring your loved one for a short period while you go away on a trip, make up the needed sleep you might have lost, or just stay home and enjoy the solitude. Inquire about the governmental services the person may be entitled to that could help you with required tasks—meal delivery service, homemaker service, respite care, shopping service, case management, transportation service, or taxi service. You may want to attend a support group in your community. Ask your doctor to recommend one.\n\n[Terrorism > Asking for and Accepting Help From Others > Caregiver Self-Assessment Questionnaire]\nCaregivers often are so concerned with caring for another person's needs that they lose sight of their own well-being. If you are a caregiver, answer the following questions and then do the self-evaluation to determine your level of stress.\n\nDuring the past week or so, I:\n\n1.

During these visits, the doctor will examine your child, make sure that he or she has all the required vaccinations, and treat any disorders. Take advantage of these visits to talk with the doctor about any concerns or questions you have about your child's health or development.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Examining a Newborn]\nImmediately after delivery, the doctor and nurses in the delivery room examine a newborn to make sure that he or she is healthy. They use a suction device to remove any mucus from inside the baby's nose and mouth, put antibiotic drops in his or her eyes to\n\nprevent infection, and give him or her an injection of vitamin K to help the blood clot normally. The doctor evaluates the infant's heart rate and breathing; measures his or her length, weight, and head circumference; and performs a thorough physical examination to look for any physical abnormalities. All babies are given screening tests for some disorders and an evaluation, called the Apgar score, of their general health status.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *The Apgar Score*]\nThe Apgar score assesses heart rate, breathing and crying, muscle tone, reflex responses, and skin color (examining the inside of the mouth and lips, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet). Each of these five components is given a number from 0 to 2, and then all five are added up. A score between 7 and 10 is a general indication that the infant is healthy. The score does not, however, predict a baby's development or long-term health.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *The Apgar Score* > **Physical examination of newborns**]\nA physical examination is performed on newborns immediately after birth to check for birth defects or other abnormalities. In most cases, early detection helps ensure successful treatment. For example, the child's mouth is examined for cleft lip and cleft palate, and his or her face is examined for features of Down syndrome (top). The infant's anus is checked to make sure it is open, the genitals are checked to verify the baby's sex, the navel is examined for swelling (a sign of an umbilical hernia), the feet are examined for clubfoot, and the hips are checked for dislocation (center). The spine is examined for any swelling or opening that could indicate spina bifida (bottom).\n\n![Illustration showing a healthcare provider examining a newborn's mouth and face.]()![](_page_660_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nExamining the mouth and face\n\n![Illustration showing a healthcare provider examining a newborn's genitals, navel, feet, and hips.]()![](_page_660_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\nExamining the genitals, navel, feet, and hips\n\n![Illustration showing a healthcare provider examining a newborn's spine.]()![](_page_660_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\nExamining the spine\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Newborn Screening Tests*]\nEvery state requires testing of newborns for a variety of disorders 24 hours after birth, before the child is released from the hospital. Some of these disorders cause no symptoms initially but can lead to serious health problems or can be fatal. Testing is done immediately after birth because the risk of complications is reduced significantly when these disorders are diagnosed and treated early. Abnormal results are followed up with more thorough, precise testing.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Newborn Screening Tests* > **Newborn testing**]\nFrom a small sample of blood taken from a newborn's heel, doctors can diagnose a number of serious but treatable disorders, including sickle cell disease and\n\nphenylketonuria (PKU).

Keep a record of all your child's vaccinations and bring the record to each visit to make sure your child's immunizations are up-to-date.\n\nAll vaccinations are given in shots, usually into the outer, upper part of the thigh or arm. Some vaccinations—such as for measles, mumps, and rubella—are combined and given in a single injection.

The measurement is compared against the average healthy range for children of the same age and sex. If your child has high blood pressure, the doctor will want to find the cause and will recommend treatment if necessary. High blood pressure can be a sign of a serious disorder such as kidney disease, heart disease, or thyroid disorders. It can also result from being overweight. If your child is overweight, the doctor will recommend a weight-loss program that will include a healthy diet and an increase in exercise; weight loss can significantly lower blood pressure.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Blood Tests*]\nAll children are given a blood test at one time or another, either to diagnose a disorder such as an infection or to screen for disorders such as anemia.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Blood Tests* > **Complete blood cell count**]\nA complete blood cell (CBC) count measures the major components of blood, including red cells (which deliver oxygen to cells), white cells (which fight infection), and platelets (which help blood to clot).

Growth rates vary considerably among children and, as long as your child is growing at a steady rate, there usually is no cause for concern.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Opening doors]\nTwo-year-olds like to explore and are eager to learn new skills, such as opening doors. To help keep your child safe, install childproof locks on any doors that you don't want him or her to open.\n\n![Illustration of a young child reaching up to open a door handle.]()![](_page_671_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Your Child's Teeth]\nAt about 6 months of age, a child's primary (baby) teeth begin to come in. In most cases, a child has a full set of primary teeth by the time he or she is 2 years old. A baby's first\n\nteeth, the incisors, usually appear during the first year and seldom cause problems. The baby may be irritable, cry more than usual, and have difficulty sleeping. Gums may be red and swollen, and the baby may drool more than usual and gnaw on his or her fingers. You may be able to see the teeth coming through the gums. Your baby's feeding, sleeping, and bowel habits may change, but he or she usually has very little pain.\n\nThe first and second molars, which usually appear between ages 1 and 3, are much more likely to cause discomfort. Gums may be tender, making eating painful, and the cheek on the affected side of the mouth may feel hot and look flushed. To help relieve your child's discomfort, rub his or her gums gently, give the child a cool drink from a cup, or give him or her a teething ring, teething biscuit, or bagel to chew. To relieve pain, give the child acetaminophen or ibuprofen (not aspirin), or rub his or her gums with an over-the-counter, pain-relieving dental cream or gel for children.\n\nIn some cases, a disease or disorder in a child may be overlooked because parents attribute the symptoms to teething. For example, clutching one side of the face may be a sign of an ear infection (see page 417) rather than teething-related discomfort. Therefore, you should talk to your doctor if your child of teething age shows any signs of distress.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Teeth]\nThe ages at which both baby teeth and permanent teeth appear vary from one child to another. Some children have one tooth or more at birth; others may have no teeth at 1 year. The ages listed here are averages, are intended for comparison purposes only, and do not reflect a child's general health or development.\n\n**Full set of baby teeth: 20**\n\nDiagram illustrating the stages of baby teeth eruption in the upper jaw.\n\n**Top Diagram (Upper Jaw):**\n\n- First incisor\n- Second incisor\n- Canine\n- First molar\n- Second molar\n\n**Bottom Diagram (Upper Jaw):**\n\n- Second molar\n- First molar\n- Canine\n- Second incisor\n- First incisor\n\n![](_page_673_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Teeth > Ages When Baby Teeth Come In]\n| Age       | Baby Teeth      |\n|-----------|-----------------|\n| 6 months  | First incisors  |\n| 7 months  | Second incisors |\n| 12 months | First molars    |\n| 18 months | Canines         |\n| 2-3 years | Second molars   |\n\nFull set of permanent teeth: 32\n\nDiagram illustrating the arrangement of permanent teeth in the upper and lower arches, ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "child", "relation": "gives opportunity to explore", "tail": "crawling"}, {"head": "reading aloud", "relation": "stimulates development of brain", "tail": "language and other mental skills"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "parent", "relation": "supervise", "tail": "[Event: child crawling]"}, {"head": "child", "relation": "participate in", "tail": "[Event: reading aloud]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

A prolonged lack of oxygen in the blood may permanently damage the baby's brain or lungs. The more premature a baby is, the greater the risk of respiratory distress syndrome. The disorder occurs frequently in babies who weigh less than 3 pounds at birth and also is common in infants whose mothers have diabetes (see page 889).\n\nAfter a baby's first breath has caused his or her lungs to expand, the alveoli (tiny air sacs in the lungs) are kept open by a natural chemical in the lungs called surfactant.\n\nKeeping the alveoli open is essential for breathing, because oxygen passes into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide enters the lungs to be exhaled through the capillaries (small blood vessels) that surround the alveoli. In babies with respiratory distress syndrome, however, the lungs do not contain enough surfactant, and the alveoli start to close again within minutes or hours after birth, leading to increasing difficulty breathing and inadequate exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nIn respiratory distress syndrome, a baby's breathing gradually becomes more and more labored and rapid in the first few hours after birth. As the baby breathes in, his or her chest sinks (rather than expands, as it normally would). When breathing out, the baby grunts.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome is based on the baby's symptoms and the amount of surfactant in the baby's lungs. In some cases, a doctor may be able to determine the amount of surfactant in a fetus's lungs before delivery by performing amniocentesis (see page 510). If the amount of surfactant appears to be inadequate, it may be increased by giving the pregnant woman an injection of a corticosteroid medication, which stimulates the production of surfactant in the fetus's lungs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nA baby who has respiratory distress syndrome or who is at risk of developing it is treated in a hospital neonatal intensive care unit (ICU). Treatment includes placing an inhaler over the baby's face to administer artificial surfactant to open the alveoli and help restore normal breathing. The infant also may be given artificial respiration, in which a tube is threaded into his or her trachea (windpipe) to deliver oxygen to the lungs. The baby's blood will be continuously monitored to determine the levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other body chemicals, including bicarbonate, sodium, potassium, and chloride. After treatment with artificial surfactant, infants who are very premature (born before the 28th week of pregnancy) or who are very small (about 3 pounds or less) remain at risk for respiratory distress syndrome and must be closely monitored in a neonatal ICU for signs of breathing problems.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Respiratory distress syndrome]\nThe alveoli produce a substance called surfactant, which normally coats and protects the alveoli and enables them to stay open (left) so they can absorb oxygen from inhaled air. Without surfactant, an alveolus collapses (right), causing the labored breathing that is characteristic of respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n![Diagram illustrating a normal alveolus (left) and an alveolus without surfactant (right). The normal alveolus shows the alveolar sac filled with air, and the alveolar walls are coated with surfactant. The collapsed alveolus (right) shows the alveolar sac collapsed, indicating the absence of surfactant.]()![](_page_678_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Neonatal Jaundice]\nNeonatal jaundice is yellowing of an infant's skin and the whites of the eyes that occurs soon after birth. The condition is caused by an excess of bilirubin (a waste product of the normal breakdown of red blood cells) in the blood. Normally, bilirubin is removed from the blood by the liver. In a newborn, jaundice usually occurs because the liver is not yet fully developed and cannot process the bilirubin fast enough. This type of neonatal jaundice is called physiological jaundice and occurs in more than half of all newborns.\n\nAn uncommon form of neonatal jaundice, called hemolytic jaundice, can result from a condition called Rhesus (Rh) incompatibility (see page 508), in which antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) from the mother's blood enter the fetus's blood and combine with the fetus's red blood cells, causing the cells to break down much more quickly than normal. This early breakdown of red blood cells results in excess release of bilirubin into the bloodstream, causing the baby to have severe jaundice at birth or soon after. In some cases, blood type (ABO) incompatibility, in which the blood types (A, B, AB, or O) differ betw", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "preterm infants", "relation": "are affected by", "tail": "Respiratory Distress Syndrome"}, {"head": "full-term infants", "relation": "can be affected by", "tail": "Respiratory Distress Syndrome"}, {"head": "babies who weigh less than 3 pounds at birth", "relation": "are more likely to have", "tail": "Respiratory Distress Syndrome"}, {"head": "infants whose mothers have diabetes", "relation": "are more likely to have", "tail": "Respiratory Distress Syndrome"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "a baby's first breath", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: lungs to expand]"}, {"head": "the alveoli are kept open by", "relation": "are maintained by", "tail": "[Event: after a baby's first breath]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: prolonged lack of oxygen in the blood]", "relation": "may cause", "tail": "[Event: permanent damage to brain or lungs]"}, {"head": "[Event: increasing difficulty breathing]", "relation": "can lead to", "tail": "[Event: life-threatening deficiency of oxygen in the blood]"}]}, "status": "success"}

If either looks yellow, the doctor will order blood tests to measure the levels of bilirubin, red blood cells, and liver enzymes in the child's blood. In some cases, a doctor will recommend an ultrasound scan (see page 111) or X-rays to examine the child's liver and bile ducts. In addition, a doctor may order blood tests to check for possible underlying causes of jaundice, such as Rh incompatibility.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nMost cases of physiologic jaundice clear up on their own without treatment. Mild cases of hemolytic jaundice also usually disappear without treatment. Feeding the infant stimulates the passage of meconium (the first bowel movement of a newborn) and the transition to normal stool. Bilirubin is excreted in the stool, which helps lower the levels of bilirubin in the blood.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > **Treating neonatal jaundice**]\nIf your baby needs phototherapy for jaundice, you may be able to give the treatment at home. A visiting nurse can teach you how to use the phototherapy equipment and will monitor your baby during daily visits to your home. For the treatment, ultraviolet light is delivered through a fiberoptic panel fitted into a cotton flannel sleeve that wraps around the baby like a wide belt. You can hold, feed, and change your baby while the belt is on. The longer the belt is worn each day, the faster the child's bilirubin reaches a safe level. The process usually takes 3 to 4 days.\n\n![Illustration of a woman holding a baby, with a medical device (likely a phototherapy machine) connected to the baby's arm, indicating treatment for jaundice.]()![](_page_682_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nFor obstructive jaundice, surgery to correct the blockage in the outflow of bile and bilirubin from the liver must be performed to prevent fatal liver damage, which can occur within a few months without treatment. In some cases, when the blood level of bilirubin is high, a doctor may perform phototherapy (light therapy), in which the baby is exposed to ultraviolet light to help convert the bilirubin into a form that will pass easily out of the liver, into the urine, and out of the body. Severe cases of jaundice, especially hemolytic jaundice, are treated by an exchange blood transfusion, in which all the baby's blood is replaced with donated blood.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Feeding Problems]\nMany babies cry for a few minutes after breastfeeding or bottle feeding. If your baby cries after feeding, cuddle and comfort him or her; if your baby has had enough to eat, he or she will soon stop crying and fall asleep. If your baby continues to cry, or cries a lot between feedings, he or she may not be getting enough breast milk or formula. Try giving your baby more but do not force him or her. Babies stop eating when they have had enough. Some babies cry because they are thirsty, especially in hot weather. Try giving your baby some water. If your baby begins to fuss soon after starting a bottle, he or she may be frustrated because the nipple hole is too small or clogged. If this occurs, substitute another nipple.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Poor Feeding*]\nIn the first few weeks of life, some babies fall asleep while feeding. Babies this age generally eat small amounts but need to eat frequently throughout the day and night (sometimes as often as every 2 or 3 hours). This is normal. In a healthy baby, this phase usually passes after about a month. Offer the baby the breast or bottle when he or she wakes up or when he or she cries, but don't force the baby to feed if he or she turns away. If this pattern of feeding continues or if the baby seems lethargic or seems to be losing weight, see your pediatrician. Your child's doctor will determine if your baby is getting enough milk or formula by checking his or her weight and growth pattern.\n\nYou also should contact your doctor if your baby feeds slowly or does not seem to be eating as much as usual.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Poor Feeding* > *Spitting Up or Vomiting After Feeding*]\nMost babies spit up a little milk or formula after feeding, particularly when they burp. Bottle-fed babies are more likely to spit up because they are more likely to swallow air when feeding, which can overfill the stomach. Some very active babies spit up a lot; this is usually not a cause for concern. Most babies gradually stop spitting up when they are about 4 to 6 months old, after they start eating solid food. Spitting up usually stops completely by 9 months. Changing the baby's feeding position and keeping the baby upright after feeding may help.\n\nIf your baby is vomiting large amounts, if the vomit contains blood or a greenish brown material, or if the vomit is expelled to some distance (called projectile vomiting) more than two or three times a day, contact your pediatrician right away.

Diaper rash can also result from chafing or from a bacterial or yeast infection (thrush; see page 539). Sometimes the condition is an allergic reaction to chemical irritants such as soap, detergent, or fabric softener, or to synthetic materials in disposable diapers.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptom of diaper rash is red, spotty, sore, moist skin in the area that is usually covered by a diaper. The rash is painful and can range from mild to severe.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nDiaper rash is easily diagnosed by its appearance and is easy to treat at home. Expose the rash area to warm, dry air for as long as possible throughout the day—take the baby's diaper off and lay him or her face down on soft towels placed over a waterproof sheet. Clean up any stool or urine immediately, and bathe the rash with warm water and a mild soap. Change the towels as often as necessary. Afterward, pat the affected area dry with a soft, clean towel. Diaper the baby at bedtime.\n\nYour doctor may recommend gently cleansing the affected area with a cotton ball soaked in mineral oil and applying a nonprescription zinc oxide cream or ointment to the rash. If the affected area becomes soiled again, cleanse it again with mineral oil and reapply the cream.\n\nIf the rash is persistent or severe, or if it worsens, talk to your doctor. He or she may recommend other ways to treat the rash at home or may prescribe a cream or ointment to help speed healing. Sometimes diaper rash becomes infected with a fungus called candida. If this occurs, doctors usually recommend a nonprescription antifungal cream or ointment to clear it up.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > **Cradle Cap**]\nCradle cap is a common, harmless skin condition that affects an infant's scalp, usually during the first 3 to 6 months of life. Cradle cap, which results from a buildup of oil and dead skin cells, is the most common form of seborrheic dermatitis (see page 1063). The thin, dry scales of cradle cap cause no discomfort for the child.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > *Symptoms*]\nThe initial symptom of cradle cap is the appearance of thin, dry, red, scaly patches on the scalp. The scales eventually become yellow, greasy, crusty patches that can cover the entire scalp and sometimes extend over the eyebrows and behind the ears. Some babies may temporarily lose some hair in the affected area.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nTo diagnose cradle cap, a doctor will examine the baby's scalp. If your baby has cradle cap, keep the affected area clean and dry by washing it with mild soap and water and drying it gently but thoroughly with a soft, clean towel. If cradle cap is unsightly, your doctor will recommend rubbing the affected areas gently with unscented baby oil or mineral oil and leaving the oil on for a few hours or overnight to loosen the scales. Later, comb the hair gently with a fine-tooth comb to loosen the scales; wash the scales away with a mild shampoo. If the condition recurs, repeat the treatment.\n\nIf cradle cap worsens or becomes itchy, or if the scaly patches become soft and begin to ooze yellowish pus, talk to your doctor. These may be symptoms of an infection that requires immediate treatment. Your doctor will prescribe a topical antibiotic ointment to apply to the skin to help relieve the baby's symptoms and clear up the infection.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Colic**]\nColic is a common condition in which a baby has episodes of loud, continuous, inconsolable crying with no apparent cause. The condition usually begins when a baby is 2 to 4 weeks old and continues for 2 to 3 months. Episodes of colic usually begin suddenly in the late afternoon or early evening, and last for 3 hours or more. The cause of colic is not known.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptoms of colic are daily episodes of loud, inconsolable crying that last for several hours. The baby may also have a swollen, tight abdomen, and he or she may clench his or her hands and bring the knees up to the chest. The baby's face may be flushed, but the area around his or her mouth may be pale. Episodes usually end after the baby falls asleep from exhaustion, or when he or she has a bowel movement or passes gas.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of colic is based on the baby's symptoms. There is no specific treatment for colic, and the condition usually clears up on its own by the time a baby is about 3 months old. Until then, the best way to deal with the problem is to try to comfort or\n\ndistract the baby without overstimulating him or her. Some babies with colic seem to feel better if they sleep in a quiet room, are handled very gently, and get a lot of attention from their parents.

A heart defect that is present from birth (congenital) may be so minor that it requires no treatment, and has no effect on a child's health. Other congenital heart defects may be so severe that immediate treatment is necessary to save the child's life.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > How Heart Defects Develop]\nThe heart of a fetus starts to develop early in pregnancy and is fully developed by the third month of pregnancy. Any disturbance in development during this critical period (such as a rubella infection; see page 508) can cause a heart defect. The cause of the vast majority of congenital heart abnormalities is unknown. In most cases, both genes and environmental factors are thought to interact to produce the defect, but specific environmental factors usually cannot be identified.\n\nAlthough most congenital heart defects occur in otherwise healthy infants, they also can be present in children with broader genetic disorders such as Down syndrome (see page 955), Marfan syndrome (see page 967), or Turner syndrome (see page 957). An ultrasound (see page 510) of the fetus is often part of a prenatal examination during the first few months of pregnancy and provides a picture of the internal organs, including the heart. The doctor studies the fetus's heart on the ultrasound and, if he or she suspects an abnormality, will recommend a more specialized test called a fetal cardiac ultrasound to get a more detailed image of the anatomy of the fetus's heart.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > How Heart Defects Develop > Birth Defects]\nAbnormalities that are present in a child at birth are called birth defects or congenital abnormalities. Although they are present at birth, their effects may not become apparent until later in life. Birth defects can result from genetic or environmental factors or both. For many, the cause is unknown.\n\nFor most birth defects, the earlier a child is treated, the better the outcome for his or her development and physical and emotional health. In addition to medical treatment, a child who has a birth defect can often benefit from counseling by a mental health professional who can help him or her deal with the challenges presented by his or her abnormality. If your child has a birth defect, you might also benefit from counseling; ask your doctor to recommend a counselor or support group that can put you in touch with other parents who have a child with a similar birth defect.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > How Heart Defects Develop > *Symptoms of Congenital Heart Defects*]\nMany cases of congenital heart defects produce no symptoms, and the defect is detected during a routine examination of the heart. In some cases, symptoms are obvious. Sometimes symptoms are present at birth, and sometimes they don't develop until childhood or much later. Some congenital heart defects that don't produce symptoms early in life require surgery to prevent problems from developing later.\n\nLack of oxygen in the blood can cause blueness of the skin (cyanosis). Cyanosis is a common sign of congenital heart problems that allow blood lacking oxygen (deoxygenated blood) to circulate through the body. A baby with mild heart failure may have difficulty feeding (because he or she does not have enough energy to suck) and he or she may lose weight and cry less than usual. In severe heart failure, symptoms are more obvious—the child's breathing is rapid and difficult even while resting, and his or her skin may be blue because of the lack of oxygen.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > How Heart Defects Develop > *Diagnosing Congenital Heart Defects*]\nA doctor can usually diagnose a congenital heart defect by examining the heart with a stethoscope, which enables him or her to hear the sounds made by the heart when the pumping chambers of the heart (ventricles) contract and the valves open and close. Sounds of blood flow that occur between the sounds of the valves are called murmurs, which can be normal or the sign of a heart abnormality. A harmless murmur is a common, normal sound of blood flow that can be heard in children after 2 to 3 years of age. These normal murmurs (also called innocent murmurs or functional murmurs) do not require any treatment.\n\nIf the child's doctor has detected a murmur that suggests an abnormality, he or she will refer the child to a pediatric cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in treating heart disorders in children) to diagnose the specific defect and evaluate its severity. Each type of heart defect usually produces a characteristic murmur, or sound. For this reason, a pediatric cardiologist can usually diagnose a specific heart abnormality with a stethoscope. However, more tests, including one or more of the following, are usually performed to confirm the diagnosis:\n\n- **Chest X-ray** An X-ray of the chest can s", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "heart", "relation": "defect", "tail": "congenital"}, {"head": "rubella", "relation": "infection", "tail": "cause"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

Small defects do not cause any symptoms and often close on their own. If a baby has a large ventricular septal defect, he or she may develop signs of congestive heart failure, such as rapid breathing, shortness of breath, excessive sweating while feeding, a heart murmur, poor weight gain, and delayed growth.\n\nChildren with atrial septal defects usually have no symptoms, but these defects rarely close on their own. If left untreated, atrial septal defects can progress and cause problems in middle age, including congestive heart failure, arrhythmias (see page 580), and pulmonary hypertension (see page 594).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Septal defects]\nA ventricular septal defect (top) is a hole in the wall (septum) that separates the right and left ventricles. Blood flows abnormally through the hole from the left ventricle into the right ventricle, potentially allowing excess blood to flow to the lungs. An atrial septal defect (bottom) is a hole in the septum that separates the right atrium from the left atrium. This defect also causes the blood to flow abnormally from left to right; if the defect is large enough, too much blood can enter the lungs.\n\nKey\n\n- Oxygenated blood\n- Deoxygenated blood\n- Mixed\n\nDiagram illustrating two types of congenital heart defects:\n\n**Ventricular septal defect (VSD):** Shows a hole in the ventricular septum connecting the Right ventricle and the Left ventricle.

Deoxygenated blood flows from the Right atrium into the Left atrium, and oxygenated blood flows from the Left atrium into the Aorta.\n\n![](_page_698_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf a child has a septal defect, the doctor may detect a heart murmur during a physical examination while listening to the child's heart through a stethoscope. To confirm the diagnosis, the doctor will order additional tests, such as a chest X-ray, an ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram; see page 561), or a recording of the electrical activity of the\n\nheart (electrocardiogram; see page 559). Doctors usually refer children with septal defects to pediatric cardiologists (doctors who specialize in treating heart disorders in children).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > *Treatment*]\nBecause children with any kind of heart defect have a slight risk of developing infections at the site of the defect if bacteria enter the bloodstream, the child's doctor will recommend that the child take antibiotics before having any kind of dental work (including cleanings) or surgery.\n\nIf a baby has a small ventricular septal defect, no treatment is necessary. More than 80 percent of ventricular septal defects close on their own. If a child has a large ventricular septal defect and signs of congestive heart failure, the doctor will prescribe heart medication and a high-calorie diet (because heart failure uses up calories that are necessary for the child's growth and development). If the baby's condition does not improve or if he or she has pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs) or is not growing at the normal rate, the doctor will recommend open heart surgery to repair the defect in the child's first year of life. Surgery is very effective in correcting these defects, enabling a child to grow and develop normally and lead a full, healthy life.\n\nIf an atrial septal defect persists beyond 2 years of age, closure is recommended to avoid future problems. Most defects can be closed using a procedure called catheter device closure. In this procedure a thin flexible tube (catheter) is used to place a metal device in the defect; the device is then locked onto the atrial walls surrounding the defect, closing the hole. Very large defects require open heart surgery. Children who have surgery to close an atrial septal defect can live a full, healthy life and have a normal life span.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > Coarctation of the Aorta]\nCoarctation of the aorta is an abnormal narrowing of the aorta, the major artery leading out of the heart. The narrowing usually occurs just beyond the point where the aorta turns down to supply blood to the lower part of the body, causing blood pressure in the aorta to increase above the narrowing and decrease below the narrowing. As a result, the child develops high blood pressure in the upper portion of the body and low blood\n\npressure in the lower part of the body, and his or her heart has to work harder to pump blood past the narrowing to the rest of the body.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > Coarctation of the aorta]\nIn a healthy heart (left), the aorta is wide enough to allow normal blood flow.

A chest X-ray will show an abnormally shaped heart. The doctor will also order an echocardiogram (see page 561) and an electrocardiogram (see page 559) to identify the abnormalities of tetralogy of Fallot and to rule out other heart defects. The doctor will refer the child to a pediatric cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in treating heart disorders in children) for further evaluation and treatment.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Treatment**]\nA child with tetralogy of Fallot will need to have surgery to correct the defects, usually in the first year of life. Before corrective surgery, the doctor may recommend a temporary solution with a surgical procedure using a special shunt that diverts blood flow to the lungs and relieves the child's immediate symptoms. But, as heart surgery for\n\ninfants evolves, more and more children with tetralogy of Fallot are having the defects repaired early in infancy, eliminating the need for this initial, temporary surgery.\n\nAfter the defects are repaired, the doctor will prescribe antibiotics for the child to take before having any dental work or surgery to prevent a bacterial infection of the heart. After surgery, the child will grow and develop normally, but he or she will need to be examined regularly throughout life by a cardiologist to detect any problems (such as irregular heart rhythms) that could develop.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Patent Ductus Arteriosus]\nPatent ductus arteriosus is a heart defect in which a blood vessel called the ductus arteriosus fails to close after birth. This blood vessel connects the pulmonary artery (which transports blood from the heart to the lungs) and the aorta (the main artery that transports blood from the heart to the body) in the fetus. Because this blood vessel stays open (patent) after birth, some of the blood pumped from the left side of the baby's heart flows back to the lungs instead of to the rest of the body. Through a stethoscope, a doctor will be able to hear a murmur of blood flow through the ductus. Patent ductus arteriosus occurs most often in premature infants but also can occur in full-term babies.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Patent Ductus Arteriosus > Patent ductus arteriosus]\nA fetus's heart has a channel called the ductus arteriosus, which connects the pulmonary artery and the aorta. Because the fetus receives oxygen from the mother's placenta and umbilical cord, the channel allows blood to bypass the lungs. Normally, the channel closes shortly after birth to allow blood to flow to the lungs to receive oxygen. In patent ductus arteriosus, the channel stays open (patent), allowing oxygenated blood to flow back from the aorta through the pulmonary artery to the baby's lungs, making the heart work extra hard.\n\nKey\n\n→ Oxygenated blood  \n→ Deoxygenated blood  \n→ Mixed\n\n![Diagram comparing a Healthy heart and a heart with Patent ductus arteriosus.

A large opening can cause an infant to breathe rapidly and have shortness of breath, a very strong pulse, difficulty feeding, poor weight gain, and frequent chest infections. He or she may also be irritable.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosis]\nDoctors can diagnose patent ductus arteriosus by listening for a heart murmur through a stethoscope. To confirm the diagnosis, a doctor will recommend additional tests, such as a chest X-ray, an echocardiogram (see page 561), or an electrocardiogram (see page 559).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Treatment]\nThe doctor will first administer a medication called indomethacin intravenously (through a vein) to close the ductus in a premature infant. He or she will also give the baby diuretics to reduce the fluid levels in his or her body by increasing urination. The baby's intake of fluids will be limited to prevent fluid buildup.\n\nIf this treatment is not successful, if the baby is full term, or if patent ductus arteriosus is diagnosed in an older infant or child, the doctor will recommend a cardiac catheterization procedure (see page 592) to close the ductus. In this procedure, the ductus is closed off with coils inserted through a thin, flexible tube (catheter) that is threaded into the heart through an artery or vein. In rare cases, surgery (performed through an incision under the left arm) is necessary to close off the ductus.

His or her pulse is weak and the skin is cold, and he or she may have difficulty breathing. Within hours or days, a newborn will become critically ill and die unless he or she is given immediate care.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nIf a newborn develops symptoms in the hospital nursery, a doctor usually will diagnose the problem with a chest X-ray, an ultrasound examination of the heart (echocardiogram; see page 561), or a recording of the electrical activity of the heart (electrocardiogram; see page 559). If your baby shows any symptoms of hypoplastic left heart syndrome after leaving the hospital, take him or her to the nearest hospital emergency department immediately. He or she will need to be cared for at a medical center that has extensive experience treating babies with this type of heart defect.\n\nAt the hospital, the doctor will stabilize the baby with intravenous heart and blood pressure medications. The baby will need to have surgery within days to enable the right side of his or her heart to pump blood to the rest of the body and to insert a shunt to allow blood to flow to his or her lungs from the pulmonary artery. A second operation is done at about 6 to 12 months of age and a third one between ages 2 and 4. Even after these operations, a child's heart will not be normal; he or she always will need medication to keep the heart functioning well and will need to see a pediatric cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in treating heart disorders in children) regularly. If the three-stage surgery is not recommended in your child's case, a heart transplant to save your child's life is an option, provided a compatible donor heart is available.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Neural Tube Defects]\nThe central nervous system (see page 666), which includes the brain and spinal cord, develops in the fetus within the first 2 months of pregnancy from a strip of cells that runs along the back of the embryo. The edges of the strip gradually curl inward to form a tube of cells. The front part of this tube expands to form the brain; the back part of the tube forms the spinal cord. A liquid (called cerebrospinal fluid) produced by the brain forms inside and around the brain and spinal cord to cushion them. Bone cells develop into the\n\nskull and spinal column, which provide more protection for the brain and spinal cord.\n\nNeural tube defects—in which the brain, spinal column, or spinal cord is malformed—are disorders of the central nervous system that are present at birth (congenital). Neural tube defects are linked to a deficiency of the B vitamin folic acid in a pregnant woman. During the first few weeks of pregnancy, which are crucial to the development of the fetus's central nervous system, many women do not know they are pregnant. Most cases of neural tube defects could be prevented if women of child-bearing age who might become pregnant would take 400 micrograms of folic acid (in a supplement or in a multivitamin) every day before they become pregnant and throughout their pregnancy (especially during the early weeks).\n\nNeural tube defects can run in families. If a couple has one affected child, or relatives who have a child with a neural tube defect, they should talk to a genetic counselor (see page 952) about their risks of having another child with the abnormality and to learn how they can prevent it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Spina Bifida]\nIn a neural tube defect called spina bifida, part of the spinal column does not develop fully, leaving the nerves of the spinal cord in that area exposed and unprotected. The disorder usually affects the bones (vertebrae) in the lower spine and the meninges (the membranes covering the spinal cord). The spinal nerves in that area control the leg muscles, bladder, and intestines. The extent of physical disability depends on the severity of the spinal defect.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Spina Bifida > *Symptoms*]\nThe defect in the lower spine and the resulting damage to the spinal cord and symptoms can vary widely. The mildest form of spina bifida, called spina bifida occulta, is not technically a neural tube defect because only the vertebrae are malformed—the spinal cord and meninges remain inside the spinal column. The only visible sign of spina bifida occulta may be a small dimple in the skin, a birth-mark, or a wisp of hair over the lower spine. In some children, the spine has an abnormal curve. In rare cases, a child with spina bifida occulta has a physical impairment.\n\nIn the most severe and most common form of spina bifida (meningomyelocele), the meninges and spinal cord are exposed on the child's back. In another form, known as a meningocele, a bulging sac containing the meninges appears on the child's back.

This fluid is produced by the brain and passes into the space around the brain, where it is absorbed into a membrane surrounding the space. If too much fluid is produced, if the membrane is abnormal in a developing fetus, or if the flow of cerebrospinal fluid is blocked, the fluid builds up in the cavities of the brain. This fluid buildup can put pressure on the brain, which can cause the brain to swell, spreading apart the loosely connected bones of the skull and causing the child's head to become larger than normal.\n\nHydrocephalus sometimes occurs with spina bifida (see page 398). In premature infants, hydrocephalus can occur from bleeding in the brain. If hydrocephalus is well advanced at birth, the brain can be damaged severely, limiting a child's physical and mental development and, in some cases, resulting in death. Hydrocephalus can occur later in infancy as a result of damage to the brain from an infection or a tumor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nA doctor may suspect that a newborn has hydrocephalus if the circumference of his or her head is significantly larger than average for his or her overall size or if the head is growing too rapidly. If the doctor suspects hydrocephalus, he or she will measure the baby's head periodically. If the rate of growth of the head is greater than normal for the baby's age and size, the doctor probably will order an ultrasound scan (see page 111), an MRI (see page 113), or a CT scan (see page 112) to help make a diagnosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nHydrocephalus is treated surgically. The infant is given general anesthesia, and the surgeon drills a small hole in the infant's skull. The doctor inserts a tube with a one-way valve into the hole, extending it into the ventricle (a natural space in the brain). He or she then inserts the other end into the child's abdomen or into a major blood vessel leading into the heart. Fluid then drains from the brain through the tube into the abdomen or bloodstream. Placement of the tube is permanent.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > **Hydrocephalus**]\nAt birth, the bones of the skull are slightly separated (top left), and you can feel a soft spot called the fontanelle on the top of the child's head. The bones grow together by age 2. In a child with hydrocephalus, the buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the cavities of the brain causes the brain to swell and spread the skull bones farther apart (bottom right), enlarging the child's head.\n\nDiagram illustrating the difference between a Normal skull and a Skull in hydrocephalus.\n\n- **Normal skull:** Shows the separation of bones and the soft spot (Fontanelle).\n- **Skull in hydrocephalus:** Shows the bones spread farther apart, indicating increased pressure.\n\n![](_page_713_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Treating hydrocephalus]\nTo relieve pressure on the brain from the accumulation of fluid in hydrocephalus, a surgeon may insert a permanent tube (called a shunt) into the child's head to drain the fluid from the brain into the child's abdomen or into a vein in the neck. The tube usually remains in place for life.\n\nDiagram illustrating the surgical procedure for treating hydrocephalus, showing a Ventricular catheter inserted into the brain and a Peritoneal catheter draining fluid from the brain into the abdomen.\n\n- Ventricular catheter inserted into brain\n- One-way valve\n- Peritoneal catheter draining fluid from the brain into the abdomen\n\n![](_page_713_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\nAfter the surgery, the baby's head will gradually return to a normal size. During the first year, he or she will need to have frequent checkups. When children with\n\nhydrocephalus have this surgery early in life, their chances of normal mental and physical development are good.\n\nIn some cases, as the child grows, the tube becomes blocked, causing pressure to build up in the brain. If this occurs, the child will be irritable, vomit frequently, or develop a headache and fever. If you notice these symptoms in your child, take him or her to the doctor or to a hospital emergency department immediately. If the tube in your child's brain is blocked, he or she will be hospitalized and the blockage will be removed or the tube replaced.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Other Congenital Disorders]\nSome birth defects are inherited. Others can result from an abnormality that occurs during fetal development. In most cases, the earlier a child is treated, the more successful the outcome, especially for disorders that can affect a child's development. For example, congenital dislocation of the hip can interfere with a child's learning to walk, and cleft lip and cleft palate can affect a child's ability to speak and can make eating difficult. Once these disorders are treated, a child can lead a full, healthy life.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Other Congenital Disorders > Congenital Dislocation of the Hip]\nS", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "fluid", "relation": "builds up in", "tail": "cavities of the brain"}, {"head": "brain", "relation": "swells", "tail": "spreading apart the loosely connected bones of the skull"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: fluid buildup]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: pressure on the brain]"}, {"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Many babies with normally formed feet persistently turn them inward, but their feet can be manipulated back into the proper position. A clubfoot cannot be placed in the proper position. Clubfoot may run in families and is more common in boys than in girls. In rare cases, clubfoot is linked to other birth defects. Nearly all cases of clubfoot are detected at birth and treated, enabling the child to learn to walk normally.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nA clubfoot usually turns down and in. It is seldom painful, but it affects a child's ability to stand and walk. If not treated, the child cannot move the foot normally and walks on the side or top of the foot.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA doctor usually can diagnose clubfoot from a physical examination and X-rays. If a clubfoot is minor, the doctor will show the parents how to manipulate the child's foot regularly each day until, as the bones and ligaments develop, the foot settles into a normal position. In more severe cases, the doctor will refer the child to an orthopedic specialist. The orthopedist will manipulate the foot into as close to normal a position as\n\npossible and put a splint or plaster cast on it to hold it in place. Every 2 days, and then at 2-week intervals, the orthopedist will remove the splints or cast, manipulate the child's foot closer to its normal position, and put new splints or a new cast on the foot to hold it in the new position. This treatment takes about 3 to 6 months, after which the child wears corrective shoes. If these measures do not correct the problem, surgery may be necessary.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Clubfoot]\nClubfoot is a birth defect in which a child's foot is twisted or turned out of its normal position, usually down and in. One or both feet may be affected.\n\n![Illustration of a foot showing the characteristic deformity of clubfoot, where the foot is twisted and turned outwards.]()![](_page_718_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate]\nA cleft lip is a vertical split in the upper lip that may be partial or extend up to the base of the nose. In some children who have a cleft lip, the nose appears to be flattened. Some children have two splits that can affect both sides of their upper lip, or a gap that continues along the roof of their mouth (the palate). This gap, called a cleft palate, runs along the middle of the palate and extends from behind the teeth to the cavity of the nose. A child with a cleft palate has difficulty eating and swallowing. A newborn may regurgitate milk through the nose. If not treated, the appearance of the cleft lip can cause emotional distress for the child, and an untreated cleft palate can cause serious speech difficulties.\n\nIn most cases, the cause of cleft lip and cleft palate is unknown, but both genetic and nongenetic factors appear to play a role. The abnormalities sometimes can run in families and may affect more than one child in a family. For this reason, if you have a child with a cleft lip or palate, or if you have a repaired cleft, it's a good idea to see a\n\ngenetic counselor (see page 952) to determine your risk of having a child with the same birth defect in the future.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nAll newborns are checked for cleft lip and cleft palate, which are obvious at birth. If a baby has a cleft, the doctor will examine him or her immediately to determine the extent of the defect.\n\nA baby with a cleft lip or cleft palate will need to have corrective surgery. He or she is likely to receive care from a team of specialists, including a pediatrician, speech therapist, orthodontist (a dentist who specializes in correcting irregularities of the teeth), pediatric dentist, plastic surgeon, and otolaryngologist (a doctor who specializes in disorders of the ear, nose, and throat).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment* > **Cleft lip and cleft palate**]\nA cleft lip (above left) can vary in severity from a notch in the upper lip to a split extending to the base of the nose. It can occur on one or both sides of the nose. In some cases, a cleft lip extends into the roof of the mouth (palate), forming a cleft palate (above right). A cleft palate also may occur alone.\n\n![Three diagrams illustrating cleft conditions. The top left shows a Cleft lip. The top right shows a Cleft lip and cleft palate.

Because a baby does not use its digestive system until after he or she is born, malformations of the digestive system that occur during fetal development do not affect the baby until after delivery.\n\nThe two main types of malformations that can affect an infant's digestive system are stenosis (narrowing of a tube or duct, sometimes almost to the point of closing) and atresia (blockage in a tube or duct that separates it into two distinct, sealed-off sections). The causes of these defects are not known.\n\nAlthough any abnormality in the digestive system can affect an infant's ability to digest food and absorb nutrients, these abnormalities also can pose some other risks. For example, in digestive system disorders that cause vomiting, a baby may inhale the vomit, which can lead to choking or pneumonia. Disorders that cause vomiting and diarrhea can lead to life-threatening dehydration.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Meckel's Diverticulum]\nMeckel's diverticulum is a congenital (present at birth) disorder in which an abnormal sac, usually lined with gastric (stomach) tissue, forms near the final part of the small intestine (ileum). Meckel's diverticulum occurs in about 1 in 50 children and affects more males than females. The disorder usually does not cause symptoms unless the diverticulum is obstructed, infected, or bleeds from sores in the diverticulum. Stomach acid from the stomach tissue causes the sores, which can bleed severely. If inflammation is severe, the sac can rupture and cause an abscess (a pus-filled cavity) or inflammation of the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritonitis; see page 759). Sometimes Meckel's diverticulum causes a condition called intussusception (see next page), in which the intestine folds back on itself like a telescope. Intussusception occurs more often in infants and young children than in adults.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nThe symptoms of Meckel's diverticulum include bleeding from the rectum (the blood is dark reddish brown) and sometimes abdominal pain or vomiting, or, rarely, fever. The condition can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are similar to those of other disorders such as an intestinal obstruction (see right), appendicitis (see page 771), or a perforated duodenal ulcer (see page 755).\n\nIf a person has symptoms of Meckel's diverticulum, the doctor will order a radionuclide scan (see page 114) to see if stomach tissue is in the diverticulum, and a blood test to check for anemia (see page 610). If the radionuclide scan does not show\n\nMeckel's diverticulum, more imaging tests will be done to determine the cause of the symptoms.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTo treat Meckel's diverticulum, doctors first stop any intestinal bleeding and treat the anemia. Once the bleeding has stopped and the anemia is reduced, the person undergoes surgery to remove the diverticulum and correct any problems such as intussusception. A doctor may prescribe antibiotics to prevent or treat complications such as peritonitis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Intestinal Obstruction**]\nIntestinal obstruction occurs when the small or large intestine is partially or completely blocked, preventing food and waste from passing through the intestines. The problem can result from a number of disorders of the digestive system.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Intestinal Obstruction** > **Pyloric stenosis**]\nPyloric stenosis is a congenital disorder in which the muscular walls of the pylorus—the outlet from the stomach to the duodenum (the first section of the small intestine)—thicken, which narrows the passageway inside and prevents food from moving from the stomach into the intestines. Pyloric stenosis usually occurs between 2 and 8 weeks after birth and is more common in boys than in girls. The disorder often runs in families. The most common symptoms are choking and vomiting after feeding.\n\nThe baby may be irritable and restless and may begin to lose weight. If not treated, pyloric stenosis can lead to dehydration, pneumonia caused by inhaled vomit, or malnutrition, or can be fatal. To treat the disorder, surgery is performed to widen the pylorus to allow food to pass through.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Intestinal Obstruction** > **Intestinal atresia**]\nIn intestinal atresia, an infant is born with one or more parts of the small intestine missing or shriveled into a useless cord. The main symptom of intestinal atresia is intermittent vomiting of bile (a digestive fluid produced by the liver) beginning within a few hours of birth. The baby has no bowel movements, and his or her abdomen swells as gas builds up in the intestines. To treat intestinal atresia, surgery is performed to join the healthy sections of intestine.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Intestinal Obstruction** > **Intestinal atresia**]\nIn", "response": {"entity_entity": [], "entity_event": [{"head": "baby", "relation": "does not use", "tail": "[Event: digestive system]"}, {"head": "digestive system", "relation": "affects", "tail": "baby"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

Part of the liver, spleen, or stomach or part of the large and small intestines may protrude through the opening into the chest and press on one of the lungs (usually the left lung), causing breathing difficulties. In severe cases, the baby's skin may turn blue (cyanosis) from lack of oxygen and the baby may be placed on a ventilator to assist with breathing until surgery is performed.\n\nSurgery (which is done as soon as possible) involves opening the chest and pushing the protruding organs back into the abdominal cavity and stitching up the diaphragm. Many infants with a diaphragmatic hernia die before or after surgery because their lungs are significantly underdeveloped and they cannot breathe, even with assistance from a ventilator. After surgery, the infant may be placed on a heart-lung machine, which removes carbon dioxide from the blood and supplies adequate oxygen. This procedure enables the diaphragm to rest and heal and improves the infant's chances of survival.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragmatic hernia > **Surgical adhesions**]\nAfter abdominal surgery, scar tissue called adhesions may form in the abdomen and bind segments of the intestines together, causing an obstruction. The symptoms of surgical adhesions include abdominal swelling, cramping, and pain. The usual treatment for adhesions is surgery to cut the scar tissue to release the segments of intestine that are bound together.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragmatic hernia > **Paralytic ileus**]\nAfter an infection or surgery, the intestine can become paralyzed, losing its ability to move waste to the rectum. The intestine becomes stretched as it fills with fluid, waste, and air, causing inflammation and pain in the abdomen. Paralytic ileus can lead to fecal impaction, in which hardened stool becomes lodged in the intestine. To treat paralytic ileus, the doctor inserts a flexible tube through the child's nose and down into his or her intestine to remove fluid, waste, and air. The child is given nothing by mouth and is fed intravenously (through a vein) until gas or stool is passed and intestinal function returns to normal.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragmatic hernia > **Esophageal Atresia**]\nEsophageal atresia is a rare birth defect that interferes with an infant's ability to eat and breathe. In esophageal atresia, the part of the esophagus that leads from the mouth is not fully developed and does not reach the stomach. As a result, the infant cannot swallow food or secretions (saliva and mucus), and they can enter the windpipe, partially blocking it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragmatic hernia > **Esophageal atresia**]\nIn esophageal atresia, the esophagus (which moves food from the mouth to the stomach) is not fully developed, and there is no passageway into the stomach. Surgery is performed as soon as possible to join the separated sections of the esophagus.\n\n![Diagram illustrating esophageal atresia.

The tube is blocked or closed at the junction with the stomach, labeled 'Atresia'.]()![](_page_727_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragmatic hernia > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptom of esophageal atresia is continuous bubbling noises from the infant's throat. Sometimes, if the airways are obstructed, the baby's skin turns blue from lack of oxygen. When a doctor removes the secretions with a suction tube, the symptoms disappear temporarily, but return as soon as the secretions build up again. When the baby eats, he or she may cough, gag, choke, or vomit. If your child has any of these symptoms, talk to your doctor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragmatic hernia > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of esophageal atresia is based on the baby's symptoms and a physical examination. The doctor may look for esophageal atresia by trying to pass a soft tube down the baby's esophagus. The diagnosis is confirmed with X-rays. An infant with this disorder cannot be given food or liquids by mouth and is fed intravenously (through a vein) until the condition is corrected. Surgery is performed in one or more stages to open and join the two separate sections of the esophagus, which usually eliminates the problem. After surgery, a tube may be inserted temporarily into the repaired portion of the esophagus to dilate (widen) the esophagus and hold it open.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragmatic hernia > **Biliary Atresia**]\nBiliary atresia (also called bile duct atresia) is a rare congenital (present from birth) disorder in which parts of the bile ducts (the tubes that carry a digestive fluid called bile from the liver to the small intestine) are either malformed or absent.

Cerebral palsy may be congenital (present from birth), or it may develop after birth. The disorder cannot be cured, but it does not worsen as the child gets older.\n\nFor most children who have cerebral palsy, the exact cause is unknown. The majority of cases result from brain injury during fetal development. Brain injury during delivery, an infection of the brain, or a head injury can also cause cerebral palsy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of cerebral palsy can range from mild to severe, can differ from child to child, and can change over time. In most cases, lack of normal muscle tone and muscle control makes it difficult for an affected child to maintain balance and to coordinate and control his or her movements. A baby with cerebral palsy may have difficulty sucking and swallowing. Normal developmental milestones (see page 377), such as rolling over, sitting, crawling, smiling, speaking, and walking, usually are delayed. Muscle stiffness, spasms, or poor muscle tone in the arms and legs cause many children with cerebral palsy to adopt unusual body postures or to perform involuntary limb, body, mouth, tongue, or facial movements. Because the brain damage that causes cerebral palsy can disrupt the electrical activity of the brain, some children have seizures (see page 686).\n\nSome children with cerebral palsy have vision, hearing, or speech problems. Many affected children have normal intelligence but may have a learning disability. About half of all children with cerebral palsy have some degree of mental retardation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose cerebral palsy, a doctor takes a complete medical history and performs a physical examination that includes testing a child's motor skills and reflexes. The doctor will ask you to describe how well your child can move about and will ask you questions to determine if your child has reached specific developmental milestones, such as sitting, crawling, standing, or walking. The doctor may recommend blood tests, genetic tests, a CT scan (see page 112), or an MRI (see page 113) to help make a diagnosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTreatment for cerebral palsy focuses on helping the child overcome the disabilities caused by the disorder (or minimizing their effects) so the child can reach his or her full potential. After evaluating the type and extent of a child's disabilities, the doctor will recommend appropriate measures, such as special education, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, or counseling.\n\nSpeech therapy can improve the child's ability to speak and swallow. In some cases, a feeding tube may be needed to help ensure proper nutrition and to help prevent food from entering and blocking the airway. Surgery is sometimes performed to correct bone and joint deformities, enabling some children to walk with braces, crutches, or a walker. Some doctors prescribe muscle-relaxing medication to control involuntary movements and to make movement easier. These medications can be given by mouth, injected directly into the muscles, or delivered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord). Doctors also may prescribe anticonvulsants to help prevent seizures. Surgery performed on certain spinal nerves may help decrease stiffness. Hearing problems can be improved with hearing aids (see page 1018). The doctor may recommend prescription eyeglasses or surgery to correct misaligned eyes (see page 1055).\n\nA child who has cerebral palsy should be examined regularly by a doctor to monitor his or her general physical and mental progress. Your doctor can recommend steps you can take to help your child reach his or her full potential and to enhance the quality of his or her life. Caring for a child with cerebral palsy can be demanding and stressful. Ask your doctor or a hospital social worker about support groups and other organizations that can help you and your child.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Febrile Seizures]\nA febrile seizure is a disturbance in the electrical activity of the brain caused by the rapid onset of a high fever in infants and children. Febrile seizures are very common, affecting 4 to 10 percent of all children between ages 6 months and 5 years. Febrile seizures can be simple or complex. A simple febrile seizure, the most common type, lasts 1 to 5 minutes and affects the entire body. Complex febrile seizures last longer than 15 minutes, affect only one side of the body, and can occur more than once in 24 hours.\n\nChildren who have had a febrile seizure have a 30 percent chance of having another one within the next 6 months.", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "cerebral palsy", "relation": "caused by", "tail": "faulty development of or damage to the areas of the brain that control muscle movement"}, {"head": "cerebral palsy", "relation": "resulting in", "tail": "weakness of the arms and legs accompanied by stiffness (called spasticity) or floppiness and, sometimes, unusual body postures"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "brain injury during fetal development", "relation": "results from", "tail": "[Event: majority of cases]"}, {"head": "cerebral palsy", "relation": "may develop after", "tail": "[Event: birth]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: brain injury during fetal development]", "relation": "results in", "tail": "[Event: cerebral palsy]"}, {"head": "[Event: infection of the brain]", "relation": "can cause", "tail": "[Event: cerebral palsy]"}]}, "status": "success"}

A child with Reye's syndrome will have low sugar levels and elevated levels of ammonia and liver enzymes in the blood. The clotting time of the blood also is tested; the blood may take longer than normal to clot. The doctor will feel your child's abdomen to check for swelling of the liver. He or she may order a liver biopsy (in which samples of cells are taken from the liver and examined under a microscope) to see if the liver is damaged, and an electroencephalogram (EEG; see page 687), an examination of the electrical activity of the brain, to evaluate brain function. The doctor also may order CT scans (see page 112) or MRIs (see page 113) to assess swelling of\n\nthe brain and liver, and a lumbar puncture (see page 693) to examine the spinal fluid to rule out disorders such as meningitis (see page 692).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > *Treatment*]\nA child with Reye's syndrome is hospitalized and given fluids intravenously (through a vein) to replace those lost from vomiting, to restore the balance of electrolytes (essential minerals that help regulate various body processes) in the blood, and to reduce swelling. Brain swelling is also controlled with medication. Pressure monitors may be implanted in the brain to evaluate brain swelling. The child's electrolyte levels, blood glucose (sugar) levels, and blood clotting also are monitored. If necessary, the child may be given medication to maintain adequate blood pressure. If the child has difficulty breathing, he or she may be placed on a ventilator (an artificial breathing machine).\n\nRecovery depends on the severity of the condition. Children who have a mild episode of Reye's syndrome may recover fully in about a week, with no lasting effects. Children who survive a severe episode of Reye's syndrome may have permanent brain damage.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > **Tourette Syndrome**]\nTourette syndrome is a nervous system disorder characterized by sudden, repeated, involuntary movements and vocal sounds called tics. Unlike other tic disorders, the tics of Tourette syndrome often occur along with certain behavior disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; see page 730) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (see page 720). Children with Tourette syndrome often have anxiety (see page 718) or depression (see page 709) and may have a tendency to physically injure themselves. Other behavior disorders that commonly accompany Tourette syndrome are poor impulse control, poor anger control, and antisocial behavior. Such behavior problems can interfere with school performance and social interactions even more than the tics.\n\nTourette syndrome usually begins between 2 and 15 years of age, and the tics become the most extreme at about age 10. The tics usually lessen as the child gets older; by age 18, half of all affected people no longer have tics. In some people, the disorder is lifelong, and 10 percent of affected people have more severe symptoms in adulthood than in childhood. Estimates of the prevalence of Tourette syndrome range from less\n\nthan 1 percent to 4 percent of the population, affecting three times as many boys as girls. The disorder tends to run in families.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe tics of Tourette syndrome that involve body movement (motor tics) often include blinking, nose twitching, muscle tensing, mouth opening, shoulder rotation, head shaking, or bending of the trunk. Examples of more extreme motor tics are hitting, jumping, kicking, making obscene gestures, or imitating the gestures of others. Typical vocal tics include sniffing, throat clearing, grunting, or blowing. Some affected children repeat their own words or the words of others or shout profanities or other inappropriate words or phrases. Many children with Tourette syndrome say that these body movements or utterances are preceded by feelings of anxiety or uncomfortable sensations so severe that they can be relieved only by the expression of the tic.\n\nMost children with Tourette syndrome also display the hallmark symptoms of ADHD (inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (intrusive thoughts that trigger compulsive and repetitive actions). Their poor impulse control and inability to control anger can lead to outbursts of temper and aggressive behavior. Some children with the disorder injure themselves by biting, scratching, hitting, or banging their head.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nDoctors diagnose Tourette syndrome from a thorough medical history, a physical examination, and the observation of tics.

If your child has problems sleeping, talk to your doctor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Do Not Give Sleep Medication to Children > Nightmares]\nNightmares are frightening dreams that usually occur late at night when a child is in deep sleep. When a child has a nightmare, he or she wakes up frightened and may scream or cry. Although children of all ages have occasional nightmares, children between ages 3 and 6 experience them the most. Nightmares usually occur after a child has witnessed a disturbing incident, heard a scary story, or watched a frightening movie or television program. Occasionally, nightmares signal that a child is experiencing unresolved stress caused by problems at home or at school.\n\nThe best way to deal with nightmares is to comfort your child. Turn the lights on to reassure your child that it was only a dream. Hug your child, and take his or her mind off the disturbance by speaking soothingly about something pleasant. Reassure your child that nothing will harm him or her. If your child has frequent, recurring nightmares, try leaving a night-light on in his or her room. To try to find out what the underlying problem is, ask him or her to talk about it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Do Not Give Sleep Medication to Children > Comfort for nightmares]\nIf your child wakes up frightened and crying from a nightmare, comfort and reassure him or her. Stay with your child until he or she is calm and ready to go back to sleep.\n\n![Illustration of a man comforting a child who is lying in bed, looking frightened, while the man gently strokes the child's head.]()![](_page_739_Picture_7.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Night terrors]\nA night terror is another type of frightening dream that occurs most often in children between ages 2 and 5. When a child has a night terror, he or she screams or cries out suddenly during sleep and jumps out of bed. The child looks terrified and may be sweating and breathing rapidly. He or she may talk or babble and have wide-open eyes but is still asleep. The child may not recognize familiar people, such as his or her parents, and may be difficult to wake. Doctors do not know what causes night terrors.\n\nIf your child has a night terror, check to make sure that he or she is not ill or injured. Because the child is still asleep, he or she may not calm down even when you hold or talk to him or her. The child will usually stop crying or screaming after a few minutes.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sleepwalking]\nSleepwalking is a disorder in which changes in the electrical activity of the brain during sleep cause a child to awaken partially during the night. The child may sit up in bed and perform repetitive movements or may get out of bed and walk around. He or she will not respond to others.\n\nIf your child is sleepwalking, do not wake him or her. Instead, silently guide your child back to bed. The child will usually fall back into a deep sleep and will not remember the incident. To protect your child, put a gate in his or her bedroom doorway and across the top of any stairs, and close any accessible windows.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sleepwalking > If Your Child Has Sleep Problems]\nMost children outgrow nightmares, night terrors, and sleepwalking before they reach adolescence. Making sure that your child does not get overtired during the day and that he or she gets enough sleep at night may help eliminate these problems. If your child has persistent sleep problems, see your doctor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Learning Disabilities]\nNot all children develop skills at the same rate. Although some children may be slower than others of the same age to develop certain skills, they usually catch up eventually. A learning disability is a significant gap between a person's intelligence and the skills he\n\nor she has achieved at each age. Learning disabilities are neurological disorders in which the brain is unable to correctly process, use, or retrieve information that a person reads or hears.\n\nAlthough the exact cause of learning disabilities is not known, doctors think that they may be caused by disturbances in brain development before birth. Factors that may affect brain development include genes, fetal exposure to drugs (such as alcohol and tobacco) used by a woman during pregnancy, or complications during pregnancy (including preterm delivery; see page 529) that can affect the fetus's developing brain. Exposure to environmental toxins such as lead (see page 425) after birth also can contribute to the development of learning disabilities.\n\nLearning disabilities can affect people of all ages and backgrounds. Many people with learning disabilities are of average or above-average intelligence. The symptoms of learning disabilities can vary greatly from one person to another, and some people have more than one learnin", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "sleep medication", "relation": "interfere with", "tail": "normal sleep"}, {"head": "sleep medication", "relation": "disrupt", "tail": "child's sleep patterns"}, {"head": "sleep medication", "relation": "suppress", "tail": "breathing"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "talk to", "tail": "[Event: problems sleeping]"}, {"head": "parent", "relation": "give", "tail": "[Event: sleep medication]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

Children with dyscalculia may have difficulty recognizing numbers or symbols, remembering information such as multiplication tables, or understanding concepts such as fractions. They also may have trouble telling time, keeping track of time, or reading maps.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Dysgraphia]\nDysgraphia is a neurological disorder characterized by the inability to write words on a page. A person with dysgraphia may have difficulty spelling, holding a writing instrument, or forming letters or words on a page. Such difficulties can cause the person's handwriting to be distorted or illegible. A child with dysgraphia also may be unable to organize thoughts on paper even though he or she can convey them verbally.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Dyspraxia]\nDyspraxia is a neurological disorder that results from the inability of the brain to properly relay messages to parts of the body. A child who has dyspraxia may seem clumsy or uncoordinated and may have difficulty performing tasks such as dressing or combing his or her hair. He or she may have difficulty reading, writing, or speaking; or may be extremely sensitive to touch. Children with dyspraxia may not be able to understand logic or reason and often behave immaturely.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Dyspraxia > *Diagnosing and treating academic skills disorders*]\nTo diagnose an academic skills disorder, a child will take tests to evaluate his or her reading, writing, and math abilities. The child may also have vision and hearing tests to rule out vision and hearing problems.\n\nThe treatment of academic skills disorders depends on the disorder. For example, a person who has dyslexia can benefit from a language program that teaches him or her to identify sounds. A person who has dyscalculia may benefit from doing real-life math problems such as counting money. He or she can use a calculator to check his or her work. A person with dysgraphia can benefit from using a computer, using a tape recorder, drawing a picture, or using checklists to organize and express thoughts. A person who has dyspraxia can benefit from physical or occupational therapy to improve his or her coordination and ability to perform daily tasks.\n\nIf your child has a learning disability, work closely with his or her teachers and your doctor and other health care professionals to make sure your child gets the needed help. With appropriate intervention and educational programs, most people find ways to compensate for their learning disability and can lead successful, productive lives.\n\nSupport groups and other organizations are available for people with learning disabilities and their friends and family members.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Common Ear Problems in Children]\nEar infections are a common problem in young children, especially between ages 6 months and 1 year. Middle ear infections occur when an upper respiratory infection, such as a cold, spreads to the middle ear cavity by way of the eustachian tube.\n\nSome children have repeated ear infections, which, if left untreated, can lead to serious complications, such as hearing loss. Hearing loss that occurs early in childhood can have a significant impact on a child's speech and language development.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Common Ear Problems in Children > Ear Infections]\nInfection or inflammation of the middle ear (a condition that doctors call otitis media) can occur in people of all ages but is most common in infants and young children. Otitis media can be either acute (short and severe) or chronic (long-lasting). If a child has three or more acute ear infections within 6 months, or four or more infections within 12 months, the condition is called recurrent acute otitis media.\n\nOtitis media can result when fluid or mucus from a bacterial or viral infection of the nose and throat (such as a cold or flu) or an allergy causes the eustachian tube (the tube that connects the middle ear to the back of the nose and throat) to swell and to drain improperly. Exposure to secondhand smoke can increase the risk of inflammation and infection of the respiratory tract and problems with the eustachian tube in young children. In some children, the adenoids (lymph tissue that lies on each side of the back wall of the nose and the upper part of the throat) can become enlarged and can block drainage from the eustachian tube. If the eustachian tube is blocked, pus can build up in the middle ear, putting pressure on the eardrum and causing severe pain, hearing loss, and, possibly, a ruptured eardrum (see page 1022).\n\nEar infections and accumulation of middle ear fluid are more frequent in children than in adults because a child's eustachian tubes are smaller and more horizontal than\n\nthose of an adult, making it more difficult for infected fluid to drain.

Chronic otitis media with effusion can also develop without infection —from an anatomical cause such as a cleft palate (see page 403), Down syndrome (see page 955), or a too-narrow eustachian tube. In some cases, the fluid becomes very sticky (which doctors call glue ear). The buildup of fluid can cause mild hearing loss and may delay a child's language development.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nChronic middle ear fluid often does not cause any symptoms. However, sounds may seem muffled or faint, as if heard under water. Some children may have difficulty distinguishing certain sounds in noisy situations.\n\nIf untreated, chronic middle ear fluid can result in poor development of language skills in very young children. Less often, the disorder can cause an abnormal growth of the skin of the eardrum (cholesteatoma; see page 1024). Chronic middle ear fluid can also cause the tiny bones of the middle ear (ossicles) to become scarred and bond to the middle ear. If your child is developing language skills slowly or does not respond when you speak to him or her, or if he or she is having trouble paying attention at school, it could be due to partial hearing loss from chronic middle ear fluid.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nBecause chronic middle ear fluid usually has no obvious symptoms, doctors often diagnose the disorder while examining a child for another reason or during a well-child visit. However, if you suspect that your child has hearing loss after he or she has had an ear infection, see your doctor. The doctor will take a detailed health history and examine the affected ear with a lighted viewing instrument called an otoscope. He or she may also use a device called a pneumatic otoscope, which blows a puff of air into the ear to check for stiffness of the eardrum.\n\nThe doctor may refer you to an otolaryngologist (a doctor who specializes in disorders of the ear, nose, and throat), who may perform special tests such as an impedance test (see page 1016), which can help determine whether your child has fluid in his or her ear. The doctor may refer you to an audiologist (a health care professional who specializes in hearing evaluation and treatment), who will perform hearing tests (see page 1016) to determine if your child has any hearing loss.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis* > *Treatment*]\nTo treat chronic middle ear fluid that has resulted from a bacterial infection, a doctor may prescribe antibiotics, especially if he or she suspects an underlying sinus infection. Most doctors prefer to wait to see if the fluid clears up on its own, which can take up to 3 months when it affects both ears, and up to 6 months when it affects only one ear. In some cases, a doctor may recommend a procedure called myringotomy (see previous page), to drain the fluid.\n\nHowever, myringotomy is usually done only if the child has significant hearing loss that could interfere with his or her language development.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Respiratory System]\nThe respiratory system delivers oxygen to the body's cells and removes carbon dioxide from the body. The respiratory system consists of the nose, throat, larynx (voice box), trachea (windpipe), and lungs, and a system of blood vessels that carry blood to and from the lungs. In children, infections are the most common cause of respiratory system disorders.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Adenoid Disorders]\nThe adenoids are small masses of lymph (infection-fighting) tissue that lie on either side of the back of the nasal cavity, above the tonsils, and are part of the body's immune system. In most children, the adenoids begin to grow at about age 3, when children are especially vulnerable to infection. At about age 5, the adenoids begin to shrink, and usually disappear by the time a child reaches puberty. In some children, however, the adenoids continue to grow, eventually blocking the airway that leads from the nose to the throat. When this occurs, the flow of secretions at the back of the nose is blocked, and the adenoids become infected. If the infection is not treated promptly, it can spread from the nasal cavity through the eustachian tube to the middle ear, causing a middle ear infection (see page 417).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Adenoid Disorders > *Symptoms*]\nWhen the airway that leads from the nose to the throat is blocked, the child usually has a stuffy nose, breathes through the mouth, and snores. In some cases, the child's voice may sound nasal. Infected secretions drip from the child's nose during the day. When the child lies down, these secretions drip down into the throat, causing an irritating cough.

The infection usually occurs in children under 2 and usually develops during the fall, winter, or early spring. Premature infants have an increased risk of severe bronchiolitis. If your baby has an increased risk of bronchiolitis, the doctor may recommend preventive treatment with monoclonal antibodies (infection-fighting proteins produced in a laboratory to target specific infectious agents) to protect against infection with RSV. Like the common cold, bronchiolitis easily spreads among young children through contact with saliva, mucus, or airborne droplets. The most common cause of bronchiolitis is RSV (respiratory syncytial virus; see page 654).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Bronchiolitis > Bronchiolitis]\nBronchiolitis is a potentially life-threatening viral infection of the lungs that causes the bronchioles to swell, blocking the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the alveoli (the tiny sacs in which gas exchange between the lungs and the blood occurs).\n\n![Diagram of the respiratory system showing a bronchiole branching into alveoli. Labels include Blood vessel, Bronchiole, Alveoli, and Capillaries.]()![](_page_754_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > ***Symptoms***]\nThe symptoms of bronchiolitis include a runny nose, a slight fever, a cough, and shortness of breath. In severe cases, a child may experience rapid (more than 40 breaths per minute), labored breathing, and his or her skin may look blue, especially around the lips and at the fingertips. The child may need to sit up to breathe and may also wheeze. He or she may vomit and be unable to keep liquids down. If your child's skin ever looks bluish, take him or her to the nearest hospital emergency department immediately.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > ***Diagnosis***]\nTo diagnose bronchiolitis, the doctor will ask you about your child's symptoms and examine him or her for signs of dehydration, such as a dry mouth, sunken eyes, and a sunken soft spot. He or she will use a stethoscope to listen to the child's lungs for characteristic wheezing or bubbling noises that indicate the presence of mucus in the bronchioles.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > ***Treatment***]\nIn mild cases of bronchiolitis, treatment may not be necessary. Your doctor probably will recommend giving your child plenty of liquids and using a cool-mist vaporizer in the child's bedroom while he or she is sleeping to help relieve congestion. Give your\n\nchild acetaminophen or ibuprofen (not aspirin) if he or she has a fever. In some cases, a doctor may prescribe liquid medication or nebulizer treatments with a bronchodilator drug to control the coughing and wheezing. A nebulizer is a device that mixes medication with water vapor to produce a mist that the person inhales. To help prevent the infection from spreading, wash your hands frequently, especially after caring for your child.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Recurring Colds or Coldlike Symptoms]\nIt is normal for a child to have a number of coughs and colds, especially during the winter, and usually it is not a cause for concern. Children who are in day care with several children frequently get colds, as do children in their first few years of school, because they are exposed to many new viruses. Gradually, however, they acquire immunity to increasing numbers of cold viruses.\n\nA child's cold is often accompanied by a cough because, instead of blowing his or her nose, a child usually sniffs mucus down into the throat. The mucus irritates the throat, and the child coughs in an attempt to eliminate the mucus. Abdominal pain resulting from swallowing mucus is another common symptom in a child with a cold. In some cases, a child with a cold may complain of abdominal pain, which is actually muscle strain caused by coughing.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Recurring Colds or Coldlike Symptoms > *When to See a Doctor*]\nYour child may not have a cold, even if he or she has cold symptoms. In some children, coldlike symptoms result from an allergic reaction (see page 912). If your child sneezes and has a runny nose and watery eyes during the warm months, he or she probably has an allergy to pollen. However, if the symptoms occur throughout the year, your child may be allergic to some other allergen, such as mold or dust mites. In some children, recurring coughs result from a serious underlying disorder. For example, a recurring cough that is accompanied by wheezing may be a symptom of asthma (see page 640), sinusitis (see page 651), or enlarged adenoids (see page 419). In rare cases, a recurring cough may be caused by the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis (see page 958).

The spots usually appear on the ankles, shins, buttocks, and elbows. The spots tend to come and go and fade after several weeks. In some people, the rash is preceded by a sore throat, headache, fever, and loss of appetite.\n\nSome children also may have swollen joints (usually the ankles or the knees), abdominal pain that is often severe and persistent, and blood in the stool. About half have blood in their urine and a low volume of urine, which, in severe cases, can indicate widespread obstruction of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in the filtering structures (glomeruli) of the kidneys (glomerulonephritis; see page 807). Some children may develop high blood pressure.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nAllergic purpura is diagnosed by the symptoms, a physical examination, a thorough health history, and blood and urine tests. X-rays or CT scans may be performed to evaluate any complications that develop in the intestines or other organs. In most cases, treatment is not necessary because the condition tends to clear up on its own within a month, but a child may be hospitalized to watch for serious complications. For severe cases, a doctor may prescribe corticosteroids to reduce inflammation, or intravenous gamma globulin (which contains antibodies to fight infection) to alleviate symptoms.\n\nIf the kidneys are affected, the doctor will want to see the child for regular checkups to monitor the health of the kidneys. In some cases, a doctor may do a kidney biopsy (microscopic examination of a sample of tissue from the kidney). Elevated levels of blood or protein in the urine may persist for months in some children; these symptoms also require follow-up checkups. If the child develops high blood pressure, the doctor will prescribe medication to control it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Iron Deficiency Anemia in Children]\nIron deficiency anemia, the most common form of anemia in children, results from an insufficient supply of hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein) in the blood. The disorder usually results from an insufficient intake of iron in the diet or from poor absorption of iron by the body. Most full-term babies are born with an adequate supply of iron from their mother during pregnancy and receive iron from breast milk or formula. However, as the child grows and has an increased need for iron, a diet deficient in iron can lead to anemia. Preterm infants, who often are born with an inadequate supply of iron, and children who have a disorder that inhibits iron absorption, such as celiac disease (see page 768), have an increased risk of developing anemia. Infants should not drink cow's milk because it interferes with the absorption of iron and irritates the intestinal lining, causing intestinal bleeding and further contributing to anemia.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Iron Deficiency Anemia in Children > *Symptoms*]\nMild anemia usually causes no obvious symptoms. In more severe cases, symptoms can include pale skin (especially on the hands and inside the lower eyelids), fatigue, weakness, or behavioral changes such as irritability or anger. Less often, fainting, breathlessness, and heart palpitations may occur. All of these symptoms are more obvious after physical activity. If your child is less active than usual or if he or she is breathless after even moderate activity, see your doctor. If you suspect that your child may have anemia, do not try to treat it yourself with iron supplements, because too much iron can be dangerous.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Iron Deficiency Anemia in Children > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose iron deficiency anemia, a doctor will take blood samples to measure the level of iron. To rule out other causes, such as internal bleeding or a problem in the digestive tract that blocks iron absorption, a doctor may recommend tests such as a stool analysis to check for blood (which could indicate internal bleeding), or X-rays of the digestive tract.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > **Iron Supplements**]\nAccidental overdose of iron through supplements is the leading cause of poisoning death in children under age 6. If your doctor has prescribed iron supplements for your child, administer them exactly as directed. To prevent an overdose or poisoning, always keep all supplements out of the reach of children.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > *Treatment*]\nTo treat mild iron deficiency anemia, the doctor will make dietary recommendations to help the child get sufficient iron from his or her diet, such as ensuring that the child has an adequate intake of vitamin C, which facilitates iron absorption. To treat severe iron deficiency anemia caused by lack of iron in the diet, the doctor may prescribe iron supplements (usually in liquid form) for your child to take for 2 months or longer.

The reproductive organs are closely linked to the urinary tract.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Urinary Tract and Reproductive Organs > The urinary tract]\nThe urinary tract consists of the kidneys, the ureters, the bladder, and the urethra. The kidneys remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood to make urine. The ureters are two tubes that transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder, where the urine is stored until it is expelled from the body. The urethra is a tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the human urinary tract. It shows two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder, and a urethra.]()![](_page_763_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Urinary Tract and Reproductive Organs > Urinary Tract Infections]\nIn a urinary tract infection, microorganisms (usually bacteria) invade the urinary tract and multiply. Urinary tract infections are common among children. Girls are especially susceptible because the female urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder) is\n\nfairly short, making it relatively easy for bacteria to move up the urethra and into the bladder.\n\nFew risks are associated with one or two urinary tract infections. However, if the child is a boy or is younger than 2, or if the infection recurs, the child may have an underlying abnormality of the urinary tract that requires treatment to help prevent more serious urinary problems, such as chronic pyelonephritis (see page 806), chronic kidney failure (see page 817), or vesicoureteral reflux (see next page).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nSometimes a urinary tract infection does not cause symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include a persistent urge to urinate, difficulty urinating, or a burning sensation while urinating. The child may experience pain in the lower back, in the abdomen, or in the groin area. He or she may also have a fever, and his or her urine may be discolored and have a strong, unpleasant odor. If your child has symptoms of a urinary tract infection, talk to your doctor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA diagnosis of a urinary tract infection is based on a child's symptoms, a physical examination, and the results of urine tests. If your child is a boy or is younger than 2, has recurring urinary tract infections, or appears to be very ill, the doctor will recommend additional tests, such as an ultrasound (see page 111) or a CT scan (see page 112) of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder; a radionuclide scan (see page 114) of the kidneys; and a voiding cystogram (see page 805). The ultrasound or CT scan shows the shape of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. The radionuclide scan shows how the kidneys function and detects any infection in the kidneys. The voiding cystogram enables the doctor to examine the bladder during urination to determine the size of the bladder and to check for vesicoureteral reflux.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTo treat a urinary tract infection, a doctor will prescribe antibiotics in tablets or in liquid form. If the kidneys are affected, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics given intravenously (through a vein).\n\nAny underlying abnormality of the urinary tract can be corrected with surgery. The doctor will recommend giving your child plenty of clear fluids, preferably water, and encouraging your child to empty his or her bladder completely and frequently (at least every 4 to 6 hours). The symptoms usually subside a few days after the child begins taking the antibiotics, but your child still needs to finish all of the prescribed medication or the infection will recur.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Vesicoureteral Reflux]\nVesicoureteral reflux is a urinary tract disorder in which the mechanism that prevents the backflow of urine malfunctions, causing urine to flow backward from the bladder through the ureters and up into the kidneys. This backflow of urine can cause increased pressure on the kidneys or recurring kidney infections, both of which can lead to permanent damage and scarring of the kidneys.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Bed-Wetting]\nBy age 4 or 5, most children stay dry through the night. Other children may continue to wet the bed at night, and, in rare cases, may also wet themselves during the day. The medical term for this condition is enuresis. If a child begins wetting the bed again after a long period of staying dry through the night, the condition is called secondary enuresis.

A doctor will order blood tests to evaluate kidney function and may order an X-ray of the urinary tract called a voiding cystourethrogram (see page 805) to check for vesicoureteral reflux and, if the condition is present, determine its severity. The doctor may also recommend an ultrasound (see page 111) of the kidneys to check their size and shape and to look for a cyst, a stone, an obstruction, or another abnormality.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe treatment for vesicoureteral reflux depends on the severity of the disorder. Mild cases usually clear up on their own within about 5 years. Doctors often prescribe preventive treatment with antibiotics for children who develop frequent urinary tract infections. In some cases, medication is prescribed to control high blood pressure. In other cases, surgery is performed on the ureters to create a flap of tissue that works like a valve and prevents the backflow of urine. In severe cases the damaged kidney may be removed surgically. The remaining kidney will do the work of both kidneys.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis**]\nPoststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (also called nephritis) is a rare condition that develops in a child after an infection with streptococcal bacteria. In response to the\n\ninfection, the body's immune system produces antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) to fight the bacteria, but because of a malfunction in the immune system, the antibodies continue to be active even after the bacteria have been destroyed, and attack the kidneys. The kidneys become inflamed and produce less urine than normal. Blood leaks from the glomeruli (the filtering units of the kidney) into the urine. With prompt treatment, most children recover completely from poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. However, a few children experience persistent kidney problems and, after many years, may develop chronic kidney failure (see page 817).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nThe main symptom of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is reduced output of urine. The urine looks smoky or reddish brown because it contains blood. The reduced output of urine leads to edema, an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the body that causes swelling around the eyes and face and sometimes over the entire body. In addition to edema, some children with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis may gain weight, lose their appetite, have abdominal pain or diarrhea, or develop high blood pressure (see page 574).\n\nA diagnosis of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is based on a child's symptoms and the results of a physical examination. If the doctor suspects poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, he or she will order blood and urine tests to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf your child is very ill, the doctor may recommend bed rest. The doctor will put your child on a special diet that restricts his or her intake of sodium, potassium, liquids, and, possibly, foods that are high in protein (such as meat, fish, and eggs). The diet is designed to reduce strain on the kidneys and prevent the accumulation of fluid.\n\nThe doctor may prescribe antibiotics to treat any remaining strep infection and a diuretic to increase the child's output of urine, eliminate excess fluid from the body, and control blood pressure.\n\nIf the child's condition worsens, he or she will be hospitalized to treat any complications that could develop, such as kidney failure, heart failure (see page 570), or severe high blood pressure. The doctor will monitor your child's blood pressure and will prescribe antihypertensive medications if the child develops high blood pressure.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome]\nHemolytic uremic syndrome is a rare complication of a severe gastrointestinal infection, usually with a specific type of *E. coli* bacteria (*E. coli* O157:H7). The bacteria can be acquired by eating contaminated food such as meat, poultry, or potatoes; drinking contaminated juice, water, or dairy products; or touching infected people or contaminated surfaces. Hemolytic uremic syndrome occurs when toxins from the bacteria get into the bloodstream and damage red blood cells (which carry oxygen to tissues) and platelets (which help blood to clot). The damaged red blood cells and platelets can then clog the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys, blocking the ability of the kidneys to filter and remove waste products.\n\nHemolytic uremic syndrome is one of the leading causes of acute kidney failure in children under 10. Although most children have no long-term complications from hemolytic uremic syndrome, some may have permanent kidney damage and may need dialysis (see page 818) or a kidney transplant (see page 820). In severe cases, hemolytic uremic syndrome can be fatal.\n\nProper food handling and pr", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "kidney", "relation": "function", "tail": "evaluate"}, {"head": "X-ray", "relation": "check", "tail": "vesicoureteral reflux"}, {"head": "ultrasound", "relation": "check", "tail": "kidneys"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "order", "tail": "[Event: blood tests]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "order", "tail": "[Event: X-ray of the urinary tract]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "recommend", "tail": "[Event: ultrasound of the kidneys]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: blood tests]", "relation": "evaluate", "tail": "[Event: kidney function]"}, {"head": "[Event: X-ray of the urinary tract]", "relation": "check", "tail": "[Event: vesicoureteral reflux]"}, {"head": "[Event: ultrasound of the kidneys]", "relation": "check", "tail": "[Event: size and shape of kidneys]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Usually only one kidney is affected, although both can be affected. The abnormal kidney may be either small or enlarged, with a number of irregular cysts. Renal dysplasia is one of the most common prenatal developmental abnormalities and is often detected before birth during a routine ultrasound scan. The disorder is not inherited.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe most common sign of renal dysplasia in a newborn is a noticeable mass in the baby's abdomen. The infant may also develop a urinary tract infection, blood in the urine, and high blood pressure. If both kidneys are affected, infants sometimes die if they do not receive a kidney transplant (see page 820). Other developmental\n\nabnormalities of the urinary tract—such as an obstructed bladder, ureter, or urethra—are also sometimes present.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nDoctors often identify renal dysplasia during an ultrasound scan before birth. In older children, doctors sometimes detect the possibility of renal dysplasia during a physical examination while taking the child's blood pressure. The diagnosis can be confirmed by an ultrasound scan or a radionuclide scan (see page 114).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nA child with renal dysplasia may not require treatment because a person can live with only one working kidney. However, if the disorder causes health problems, the doctor may recommend surgical removal of the affected kidney. If both kidneys are affected, the doctor will probably recommend a kidney transplant.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Wilms' Tumor**]\nWilms' tumor is a rare, life-threatening cancer in which a malignant growth forms in one of the kidneys. The disorder usually affects children under age 5, boys twice as often as girls. The disorder tends to run in families. Prompt treatment is needed to prevent the cancerous cells from spreading to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver, brain, or the other kidney.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptom of Wilms' tumor is a hard lump that can be felt in the child's abdomen. Other symptoms may include a slight fever, loss of appetite, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. A child with Wilms' tumor may also have the blood disorder anemia (see page 610), which can cause weakness and fatigue, and he or she may develop high blood pressure (see page 574). If your child has any of these symptoms, see your doctor right away.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nTo diagnose Wilms' tumor, the doctor will ask about your child's symptoms and perform a physical examination. The doctor will order a CT scan (see page 112) or MRI (see page 113) to locate and evaluate the tumor and to determine if the cancer has spread. He or she may order a biopsy (a microscopic examination of tissue from the tumor) to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIf Wilms' tumor is diagnosed, surgery will be performed to remove the affected kidney and prevent the cancer from spreading. The remaining kidney is able to take over the work of the one that is removed. The doctor will prescribe anticancer medication and, in some cases, radiation therapy to destroy any remaining cancer cells.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment* > **Undescended Testicles**]\nIn boys, the testicles develop inside the abdomen from the same embryonic tissue that becomes the ovaries in girls. In most boys, both testicles descend through the abdominal wall and into the scrotum (the pouch of skin that surrounds the testicles) about a month before birth. In a small number of boys, for reasons that are not known, one testicle or, less frequently, both testicles do not descend into the scrotum by birth. In these cases, the testicle or testicles usually descend by 1 year of age. If the testicles do not descend by age 1, surgery is necessary to bring them down into the scrotum. If the condition is not corrected, the child has an increased risk of being infertile and of developing testicular cancer (see page 824) in either testicle after puberty. For these reasons, early treatment is essential.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nUndescended testicles do not cause pain or interfere with urination. Some boys who have an undescended testicle may also have an inguinal hernia (see page 763). If either or both of your son's testicles have not descended by age 1, see the child's doctor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > **Undescended testicles**]\nIn some boys, a testicle may fail to descend from the abdomen into the scrotum before birth.

However, some disorders that affect the muscles, bones, or joints in children —such as rheumatic fever, osteomyelitis, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis— can be life-threatening and often result in permanent impairment.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Rheumatic Fever]\nRheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that can develop after an infection with streptococcal bacteria, such as strep throat (see page 652). Rheumatic fever can affect the heart, brain, joints, and skin. The disease can occur at any age but usually affects children between ages 5 and 15.\n\nIf untreated, rheumatic fever can damage the heart, in a condition called rheumatic heart disease. The inflammation that characterizes rheumatic heart disease can cause heart muscle damage (myocarditis), an irregular heart rate (arrhythmia), or heart valve injury. Damage to the heart valves can prevent the valves from completely opening or closing, which forces the heart to work harder to pump blood. If the heart valves are damaged permanently, health problems such as congestive heart failure (see page 570) can develop.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Rheumatic Fever > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of rheumatic fever can resemble those of other illnesses and usually develop 1 to 6 weeks after a strep throat infection. (In some people, a strep infection can be so mild that it is not noticed.) Symptoms of rheumatic fever include fever; joint pain and swelling that moves from joint to joint (called migratory arthritis); a ring-shaped rash on the chest, back, or abdomen; or abnormal writhing movements of the body and limbs. The child may develop chest pain, changes in heart rate, and symptoms of congestive heart failure (such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and swelling of the legs, ankles, and feet). To prevent rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, see the doctor if you or your child has symptoms of strep throat, such as swollen tonsils, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, and fever. Strep spreads easily among family members.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose rheumatic fever, a doctor will take a detailed health history, listen to the child's heart and lungs with a stethoscope, and examine the skin for a rash and the joints for pain and swelling. The doctor may take a sample from the child's throat to check for strep throat and order blood tests to look for evidence of a streptococcal infection. He or she may order an electrocardiogram (see page 559), which records the electrical activity of the heart, and an ultrasound examination of the heart (echocardiogram; see page 561) to check for heart damage.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIn most cases, treating a strep throat promptly with antibiotics will prevent rheumatic fever. To treat rheumatic fever, a doctor may recommend drugs such as corticosteroids to reduce the inflammation, and he or she will prescribe antibiotics if streptococcal bacteria are present. He or she may also prescribe long-term treatment with antibiotics to prevent recurring strep infections, which can reactivate rheumatic fever.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Scoliosis**]\nScoliosis is an abnormal curvature of the spine that develops or becomes apparent during the growth spurt of puberty, between ages 10 and 12. The condition affects girls more often than boys. In most cases, the cause is unknown, but some forms can be present at birth, inherited, or related to muscle and neurologic disorders.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms and Diagnosis*]\nIn many children, the curvature of the spine is so slight that it is not noticeable. In some cases, the curvature causes the shoulders, hips, or waist to be uneven. The legs may appear unequal in length and the shoulder blades may be more prominent than usual. In severe cases, the curvature can affect the heart and lungs.\n\nDoctors screen for scoliosis as part of a routine physical examination. If your child has scoliosis, the doctor will refer you to a bone specialist (orthopedist), who will examine your child and order X-rays to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTreatment of scoliosis depends on the degree of the curvature. For a curvature of less than 20 degrees, no treatment is necessary, but a child's spine should be examined at regular intervals. A curvature between 20 and 40 degrees is usually treated with a lightweight brace (worn under clothing) to prevent the curvature from worsening. The child may also need physical therapy to help strengthen his or her back muscles. If the brace is not effective or the curvature is more than 40 degrees, the doctor may recommend surgery to correct it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Osteomyelitis**]\nOsteomyelitis is a rare bacterial infection of the bone that can develop when bacteria from a contaminated wou", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "streptococcal bacteria", "relation": "cause", "tail": "rheumatic fever"}, {"head": "infection", "relation": "lead to", "tail": "rheumatic fever"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: infection]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: rheumatic fever]"}, {"head": "[Event: strep throat]", "relation": "cause", "tail": "[Event: rheumatic fever]"}]}, "status": "success"}

He or she also may order blood tests, X-rays of the affected areas, and a biopsy of the membrane that encloses one of the affected joints. In a biopsy, a small amount of tissue is removed from the membrane for examination under a microscope. The doctor also may recommend laboratory analysis of the fluid inside the joints (synovial fluid).\n\nThe doctor may refer your child to a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in treating joint disorders) for further evaluation and treatment. He or she will recommend that your child see an ophthalmologist (a doctor who specializes in treating eye disorders), who can evaluate your child's eyes for signs of inflammation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTreatment for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis focuses on reducing the inflammation. The doctor may recommend giving your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce the fever and relieve pain, or he or she may prescribe a stronger anti-inflammatory medication to reduce pain and inflammation. The doctor will recommend a combination of physical therapy and regular exercise to slow progression of the disease, help restore and maintain mobility and flexibility in the joints, and build strength and endurance. Because fatigue can trigger a flare-up, help your child learn to balance exercise and other activities with periods of rest. Regular eye examinations are needed to check for signs of vision loss.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Childhood Infections]\nInfectious diseases occur when infectious microorganisms enter the body through the thin membranes that line the respiratory system or digestive tract. After the microbes enter the body, they start multiplying and can spread through the bloodstream and lymphatic system, causing symptoms.\n\nThe immune system attempts to fight the infection by producing proteins called antibodies to neutralize or destroy the microbes. Each microbe triggers production of a specific antibody that recognizes it. Once you have\n\nhad a particular childhood infection, your immune system is able to recognize the infection-causing germ the next time and destroy it before symptoms develop.\n\nInfectious diseases are contagious, which means that they can be spread from one person to another. Childhood infectious diseases can be contracted by inhaling airborne droplets that have been sneezed or coughed into the air by an infected person, or by direct contact with infected secretions. After recovering from some childhood infections—such as measles, rubella, chickenpox, or mumps—a child becomes immune to them, which means that he or she cannot be reinfected. This process is called natural immunity. Today, these infectious diseases are prevented with immunization, injections of harmless forms of the infectious agents to produce immunity.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Childhood Infections > Caring for a Child Who Is Ill]\nWhen a child is ill, he or she may be fussy and irritable or seem withdrawn and mokey. A sick child needs to be comforted. If your child is sick, pay special attention to his or her needs. Keep a record of his or her symptoms and, if you are unsure about anything, call your child's doctor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Childhood Infections > *Giving Medications to Children*]\nIf your child has difficulty taking medication, ask the doctor for tips. A child 3 years old or older may be able to swallow a tablet or capsule whole with the help of a drink. If the child can't swallow a tablet, ask your doctor if you should crush it and mix it with a food the child likes, such as apple-sauce or pudding. Don't open a capsule and mix its contents with food, because you could alter the timed-release properties of the medication. Remember that some medications should only be taken on an empty stomach. If you have any questions, ask the doctor.\n\nBecause small children often cannot swallow pills easily, doctors usually prescribe medication for them in liquid form. Give the medication exactly as prescribed, shaking the bottle if it is required. Special medication spoons are available that measure doses accurately.

Never use silverware spoons to give medicine to a child because the sizes of spoons can vary.\n\nIt is important for a child who is ill to take all the medication exactly as prescribed.

The disease is contracted by inhaling airborne droplets that have been coughed or sneezed into the air by an infected person. Possible complications of measles include croup (see page 420), bronchiolitis (see page 421), bronchitis (see page 655), pneumonia (see page 660), and encephalitis (see page 694).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nThe initial symptoms of measles include irritability; fever; a runny nose; red, watery eyes; a dry, hacking cough; swollen glands; and, sometimes, diarrhea. In some cases, tiny white spots (called Koplik's spots) that resemble grains of salt appear inside the mouth. Within about 4 to 5 days, a rash of flat, pink spots (each about  $\\frac{1}{10}$  inch in diameter) begins to develop, first on the forehead and behind the ears, and then on the face, neck, trunk, arms, legs, and feet. A few days after it appears, the rash begins to fade and the fever breaks.\n\nSome children with measles may be sensitive to bright light. Although this symptom is usually no cause for concern, tell your doctor because, in rare cases, it can be a sign of meningitis (see page 692), which can be life-threatening.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosis and Treatment]\nA diagnosis of measles is based on the child's symptoms and the results of a physical examination. The doctor will recommend having your child rest and giving him or her plenty of fluids, such as water, lemonade, fruit juice, or clear broth. He or she will recommend acetaminophen or ibuprofen (not aspirin) to help relieve the pain or reduce the fever. If your child is sensitive to bright light, dim the light in his or her room, or have him or her wear sunglasses. If your child develops a secondary bacterial infection such as a sore throat, an ear infection, or pneumonia, the doctor will prescribe antibiotics. Most children recover from measles within 10 to 14 days.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prevention*]\nTo prevent measles, have your child vaccinated (see page 376) when he or she is 12 to 15 months old, and again between ages 4 and 6. A doctor may give an unvaccinated child who has been exposed to measles an injection of antibodies called immunoglobulin to fight the infection, or a measles vaccination within 72 hours of exposure to the virus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Rubella**]\nRubella (also called German measles) is a mild viral infection that affects the skin and the lymph glands. The disease is usually contracted by inhaling airborne droplets coughed or sneezed into the air by an infected person. Rubella is slightly less common than measles (see previous page) and is not as contagious.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe initial symptoms of rubella include a slight fever and swollen glands behind the ears, down the side of the neck, and on the back of the neck. After 1 or 2 days, a rash of flat, reddish pink spots (each about  $1/10$  inch in diameter) appears on the head or elsewhere on the body. Gradually, the spots may merge to form patches. The rash does not itch, and it lasts for about 3 days. Other possible symptoms include a runny or stuffy nose, red eyes, pain and swelling in the joints, and, in boys, pain and swelling in the testicles.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of rubella is based on the symptoms and the results of a physical examination. The doctor may recommend rest, plenty of fluids, and acetaminophen or ibuprofen (not aspirin) to reduce fever and relieve pain. Most children recover completely from rubella in about 1 week.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prevention*]\nA combined vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella is available, and all children should be vaccinated (see page 376). Women who could become pregnant and who have not been vaccinated for rubella (see page 508) should be vaccinated to prevent a group of birth defects called congenital rubella syndrome, which includes cataracts, congenital heart disease, and low birth weight. Because the vaccination can cause birth defects, a woman should not get pregnant for at least 3 months after having the vaccination.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Roseola Infantum**]\nRoseola infantum is a mild viral infection caused by one of two types of herpesvirus (type 6 or type 7). The infection is spread through contact with infected respiratory secretions or saliva. Roseola usually affects children between ages 6 months and 3 years.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe initial symptoms of roseola are usually irritability and a sudden high fever (between 101 °F and 105°F). In some children, the fever may cause seizures (see page 410). After about 2 to 5 days, the child's temperature suddenly returns to normal (98.6°F). As the fever subsides, a raised rash of pink or red spots appears on the child's trunk and may quickly spread to his or her neck, face, arms, and legs. The rash usually lasts for no more than 3 to 5 days.

Applying calamine lotion to the rash will help relieve itching. Oatmeal soaps or bath preparations and warm compresses can be helpful. Bathwater should be cool or lukewarm. If the rash occurs in the genital area, an anesthetic cream can be applied to relieve pain; ask the doctor to recommend one. If the rash becomes infected from excessive scratching, your doctor may prescribe a topical antibiotic ointment or an oral antibiotic. In some cases, doctors prescribe an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine to relieve itching. Trimming your child's nails if necessary can help prevent scratches.\n\nDoctors sometimes recommend an injection of chickenpox antibodies called zoster immunoglobulin to prevent or reduce the severity of the disease in children who have an increased risk of complications, such as those with immune system disorders or who are undergoing chemotherapy for cancer. An antiviral drug called acyclovir, taken by mouth, is sometimes prescribed to reduce the severity of the infection or shorten it.\n\nGive your child cold fluids and soft, bland foods. Avoid salty or acidic foods and drinks. The doctor may recommend giving your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce fever and relieve pain. (Do not give aspirin to a child or adolescent who has a fever because aspirin has been linked to a potentially fatal disorder called Reye's syndrome; see page 411.) Most children with chickenpox recover within about 7 to 10 days.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Mumps]\nMumps is a viral infection that causes inflammation and swelling of the saliva-producing (salivary) glands between the ear and the jaw. In some cases a child's joints, pancreas, testicles, or ovaries also may be affected. Mumps occurs most often in the spring and usually is spread through contact with infected saliva. The disease usually occurs in children ages 10 or older; having the infection provides lifelong immunity. Possible complications of mumps include encephalitis (see page 694), meningitis (see page 692), acute pancreatitis (see page 798), and orchitis (swelling of the testicle) in older boys. Doctors recommend that all children be vaccinated (see page 376) against mumps between 12 months and 15 months of age, and again between ages 4 and 6.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe main symptoms of mumps are swelling and tenderness on the sides of the face under the ears, which may be accompanied by an earache. In most cases, both sides of the face become swollen, one side of the face a few days before the other. A child can have difficulty talking, chewing, and swallowing. In most cases, he or she also has a headache, a fever (up to 103°F), loss of appetite, and diarrhea. If a child's testicle becomes swollen, symptoms include pain in the affected testicle, chills, a high fever (up to 106°F), nausea, and vomiting. Swelling of the ovaries or pancreas can cause discomfort or pain in the lower abdomen.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of mumps is based on a child's symptoms and the results of a physical examination. Have your child rest, and give him or her plenty of fluids, including water, fruit juice, sports drinks, tea, or decaffeinated soft drinks. Your doctor will recommend giving your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen (not aspirin) to relieve the pain and fever. You can also help relieve pain in the affected area by applying an ice pack wrapped in a towel. If the testicles are swollen, the doctor will prescribe medication to relieve the pain and swelling. Applying warm or cool packs to the testicles can often be helpful. A child with mumps usually recovers completely within about 10 to 12 days.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment* > Whooping Cough]\nWhooping cough (also called pertussis) is a serious bacterial infection of the respiratory system caused by the bacterium *Bordetella pertussis*, which makes the air passages become inflamed, narrowed, and clogged with thick mucus. The infection is spread by inhaling droplets that have been sneezed or coughed into the air by an infected person. The severe coughing bouts that are characteristic of the infection, which can cause permanent damage to an infant's lungs or brain, are the body's attempts to clear the lungs of mucus. Young infants (6 months old or younger) can contract the disease from adolescents or adults who have not been vaccinated or whose vaccine protection has weakened over time.\n\nAll children are required to be vaccinated against whooping cough (in a combined vaccine with diphtheria and tetanus) starting at 2 months of age, and four more times up to age 6. A child who has been immunized against whooping cough may still develop a\n\nmild case of the infection.

A day or two after the fever begins, small red blisters appear inside the mouth—usually on the tongue and gums, inside the cheeks, and down the throat. The blisters break open and form open sores. Chewing and swallowing may become painful, and the child may lose his or her appetite. He or she may also avoid drinking, which can cause dehydration. A painful, red, blistery rash that is not itchy appears on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. The rash also may occur between the fingers and toes and on the thighs or buttocks or in the groin area.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nTo diagnose hand-foot-and-mouth disease, the doctor will ask about your child's symptoms and perform a physical examination. In some cases, a doctor may take a throat swab or a stool sample for laboratory analysis to detect the virus and confirm the diagnosis.\n\nTo treat hand-foot-and-mouth disease, give your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen (not aspirin) to relieve the pain and reduce the fever, and plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. If he or she has trouble swallowing, try giving him or her ice chips to suck. Cold foods such as frozen yogurt or ice cream can help numb the inside of the mouth and relieve pain. Most children recover from the infection within about 10 days.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prevention*]\nTo prevent hand-foot-and-mouth disease, wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, especially after using the bathroom or changing diapers. Teach your child to wash his or her hands carefully after using the bathroom. If your child has hand-foot-and-mouth disease, do not let him or her share cups, glasses, or eating utensils. Disinfect potentially contaminated surfaces in your home with a household cleaner. Wash your child's soiled clothing in detergent and hot water. Keep your child home from school or day care and away from other people until the fever is gone and the sores have healed.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Polio]\nPolio (poliomyelitis) is a viral infection that affects the brain and spinal cord. The infection can be spread through contact with an infected person or by ingesting food or water that is contaminated with the virus. Thanks to routine vaccination (see page 374), polio is now rare in the United States. Children are vaccinated against polio when they are 2 months, 4 months, 6 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years of age.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nIn most cases, a polio infection is mild, does not affect the nervous system, and does not produce symptoms. In some cases, symptoms—such as a slight fever, sore throat, upset stomach, and headache—develop suddenly and disappear after a few days.\n\nIn rare cases, the virus causes a severe infection that produces muscle aches and twitching, and pain and stiffness in the neck, legs, and back. About a week after these initial symptoms, a person can develop paralysis, especially in the lower part of the trunk and in the legs. In severe cases, a person may have difficulty swallowing and breathing as a result of paralysis of the muscles in the throat and chest. The paralysis may be temporary or permanent. Some children have long-term muscle weakness that continues into adulthood, while others have no lasting effects. In some cases, the infection may be fatal.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms* > Post-Polio Syndrome]\nPost-polio syndrome is a condition that affects about 25 percent of people who have recovered from polio. The syndrome, which occurs from 10 to 40 years after having polio, results from the death of motor neurons (nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control muscle activity) that did not die in the initial infection.\n\nThe symptoms of post-polio syndrome can include fatigue, slowly progressing muscle weakness, muscle and joint pain, difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, and, sometimes, muscle atrophy (shrinking or wasting of the muscles). The severity of the symptoms depends on the severity of the initial polio infection. Post-polio syndrome usually is not life-threatening unless a person's breathing becomes severely impaired.\n\nTo diagnose post-polio syndrome, a doctor usually orders tests such as an MRI (see page 113) to look for changes in the brain or spine or to rule out\n\nother possible neurological disorders, an examination of the electrical activity of the brain (electroencephalogram; see page 687), and a muscle biopsy (microscopic examination of small samples of muscle tissue). He or she may order a lumbar puncture, in which a hollow needle is inserted into the lower back to remove a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord) for examination under a microscope.\n\nThere is no treatment for post-polio syndrome, and the condition cannot be prevented.

The bacteria that cause diphtheria can be spread by sneezing, coughing, or laughing. If not treated promptly, the\n\ninfection can damage the heart, kidneys, and nervous system and can cause permanent disability or death. Diphtheria rarely occurs in the United States because of widespread childhood immunization against the disease. The vaccination is given in a combined vaccine with tetanus and whooping cough (DTaP; see page 376), beginning at 2 months of age and four more times up to age 6 years. Having diphtheria does not provide immunity.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nThe symptoms of diphtheria include sore throat, a slight fever, rapid heartbeat, swollen lymph glands in the neck, difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, and, occasionally, a thick, yellow discharge from the nose. In the advanced stages, symptoms can include double vision, slurred speech, paralysis, or shock (see page 579). The most dangerous symptom of diphtheria is a grayish membrane that forms on the throat and tonsils. The membrane may become large enough to cause croup (see page 420) or obstruct breathing. Contact your doctor immediately if your child has symptoms of diphtheria.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of diphtheria is based on a child's symptoms and the results of a physical examination. The doctor may order a blood test or a microscopic examination of secretions from the nose and throat to detect the diphtheria bacteria.\n\nTo treat diphtheria, a child is hospitalized and isolated from other patients to prevent the infection from spreading. He or she is given injections of antibiotics to kill the bacteria, and antitoxins to neutralize the toxins the bacteria produce. In some cases, these medications may be given intravenously (through a vein). If a child's breathing is blocked, a temporary tracheotomy (an airway opening cut into the windpipe) may be necessary to restore breathing, or a child may be put on a ventilator to assist breathing. Supplemental oxygen may also be necessary. If the bacterial toxin spreads to the kidneys, heart, or nervous system, the doctor may prescribe intravenous fluids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce inflammation and assist breathing. The child will need to rest in bed for about 4 to 6 weeks or until he or she has recovered fully.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pinworms]\nPinworms are tiny white worms that frequently infest the intestines of young children. The eggs of pinworms can easily enter a child's body when he or she touches contaminated food or contaminated clothing, toys, or a sandbox. The eggs hatch in the intestines, and young worms quickly begin to grow into adults. About 2 weeks later, a mature female worm lays eggs around the child's anus during the night. This may cause irritation. If the child scratches the area, he or she can pick up some of the eggs on his or her fingers. If the child sucks his or her fingers or eats without washing them thoroughly, he or she can become reinfested. The pinworms can spread to other family members if the child touches food, drinking glasses, sheets, towels, or other shared household items.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nSome children who have pinworms do not have any symptoms. Others experience itching between the buttocks and around the anus, usually at night. Some girls with pinworms may have vaginal itching and may experience pain when urinating. In many children, pinworms interfere with normal sleep.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA diagnosis of pinworms is based on a child's symptoms and the results of a physical examination. Pinworms are sometimes visible in stool or may be visible around the child's anus, especially at night. You can confirm the presence of pinworms by briefly placing a strip of transparent tape across your child's anus in the early morning (before he or she has a bowel movement). Any eggs in the area will stick to the tape. Put the egg-infested tape in a plastic bag and take it to the doctor's office. The doctor can examine it under a microscope to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nBecause pinworms spread easily, the doctor may recommend treating the entire family with prescription medications (antihelminthics) that kill worms. To relieve anal inflammation, the doctor may recommend applying a nonprescription ointment that contains a substance that kills pinworm eggs.\n\nBecause it is relatively easy to become reinfested with pinworms, the doctor will recommend that everyone in the household wash their hands thoroughly and frequently,\n\nespecially after going to the toilet or handling a pet, and before touching food. All family members should cut their fingernails short and keep them short to reduce the risk of spreading the eggs.

Most girls start to go through puberty at about age 11 and boys at age 12 or 13. Precocious puberty is defined as the onset of sexual development before age 8 in girls and 9½ in boys. It occurs in about one out of every 5,000 children and is much more common in girls than in boys.\n\nIn most cases of precocious puberty (especially in girls), sexual development simply occurs earlier than expected, with no known cause. Some boys inherit a gene that brings on early puberty. About 15 percent of cases of precocious puberty result from underlying medical conditions such as central nervous system tumors (see page 682), Albright's syndrome (a disorder characterized by a group of abnormalities including irregular skin-color patches, bone deformities, and early puberty), an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism; see page 903), or adrenal gland disorders.\n\nSome children who start puberty prematurely rapidly grow taller than their peers at first but end up being shorter because the hormonal changes stop their growth before they have reached a normal adult height. Children who develop early often feel different from their peers, which can sometimes cause emotional distress. A child who develops prematurely should be evaluated by his or her doctor.\n\nTo diagnose precocious puberty, doctors use blood tests to measure hormone levels, along with observation of a child's physical changes and a complete physical examination. They may also order X-rays of the hand and wrist, taken in succession over time, to calculate bone growth. An ultrasound examination of the ovaries may be used to help compare the size of a girl's ovaries with the standard size for girls her age. A CT scan or MRI of the brain and abdomen may be done to rule out a brain or abdominal tumor as the cause of precocious puberty.\n\nThe goal of treatment for precocious puberty is to stop and possibly reverse the premature sexual development; the treatment varies depending on the cause. For example, if precocious puberty has resulted from an adrenal gland tumor, removal of the tumor will correct the condition. In most cases, a doctor prescribes a hormone (given by injection or nasal spray) that suppresses the body's production of sex hormones (estrogen in girls; testosterone in boys). Once the hormone treatment is stopped, the body's own\n\nhormone function gradually returns and the process of puberty continues normally.\n\nFemale hormones stimulate an increase in fat all over the body, but mostly on the hips, thighs, and buttocks. Girls have a normally higher proportion of fat to muscle and bone than boys do. Also, a girl's pelvis widens during puberty.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Physical and Sexual Development in Boys]\nIn boys, puberty begins at about age 12 or 13 (and continues until 17 or 18). Puberty can begin as early as 9½ years of age, and continue until 21 years of age in boys who start puberty late. A boy's testicles and scrotum (the pouch of skin and tissue that holds the testicles) usually start to enlarge by age 11 or 12 and stop by age 16 or 17. One testicle may appear to be larger or hang lower than the other; this is normal. As the testicles grow, the skin of the scrotum darkens.\n\nThe penis lengthens before it grows broader at about age 12 or 13; growth stops at about 15 or 16. The ability to ejaculate semen (a fluid produced by the male reproductive organs that contains sperm) begins about a year after the penis starts to grow. At about the time that a boy's penis starts to lengthen and widen, he usually starts having more frequent erections. It is normal to have erections for no apparent reason, although erections usually occur with sexual excitement or physical stimulation. Spontaneous erections generally go away after a few minutes and are not noticeable to anyone else. Some boys (but not all) have erections and ejaculate during their sleep when they are dreaming (nocturnal emissions, or wet dreams), which is a normal part of sexual development. Many boys worry about the size (or shape) of their penis. If changes in the testicles or penis are not noticeable in a boy by age 15, he should see his pediatrician.\n\nPubic hair is visible by age 11 or 12, but underarm hair may not appear until 13 or even 15. As in girls, the development of hair on the body varies from person to person and depends on heredity. Although pubic and underarm hair usually stop growing noticeably by about age 16 (depending on when growth started), hair on the chest and abdomen usually continues growing into adulthood. Sweating and underarm odor, along with the development of sweat glands in the groin, usually are first noticeable between ages 13 and 15.\n\nIn boys and young men, the larynx enlarges, making the Adam's apple more prominent, and the vocal cords become longer and thicker, causing the voice to deepen\n\nat about ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "girls", "relation": "start", "tail": "puberty"}, {"head": "boys", "relation": "start", "tail": "puberty"}, {"head": "precocious puberty", "relation": "result from", "tail": "underlying medical conditions"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "girls", "relation": "experience", "tail": "[Event: sexual development]"}, {"head": "boys", "relation": "inherit", "tail": "[Event: gene that brings on early puberty]"}, {"head": "patient", "relation": "participate in", "tail": "[Event: clinical trial of central nervous system tumors]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: underlying medical conditions]", "relation": "cause", "tail": "[Event: precocious puberty]"}, {"head": "[Event: gene that brings on early puberty]", "relation": "cause", "tail": "[Event: precocious puberty in boys]"}]}, "status": "success"}

The dramatic growth in height slows considerably. Pubic hair may have spread to cover the inner thighs. Hair may start to grow on the chest.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Stages of Puberty in Boys > Prepuberty]\n![Illustration of a young boy standing, representing the Prepuberty stage.]()![](_page_812_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\nEarly puberty\n\n![Illustration of a young male standing nude, representing the stage of Middle puberty.]()![](_page_813_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n**Middle puberty**\n\n![Illustration of a young male standing nude, representing the stage of Late puberty, showing a more developed pubic area.]()![](_page_813_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\n**Late puberty**\n\n![Line drawing of a male figure standing, representing the state of Maturity.]()![](_page_814_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nMaturity\n\n![Line drawing of a male figure standing, representing the state of Nutrition.]()![](_page_814_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\nNutrition\n\nNot eating the right foods, eating too much, or not eating enough during adolescence can lead to lifelong health problems or life-threatening diseases such as obesity, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and osteoporosis. The tremendous physical growth that occurs during puberty requires good nutrition. To meet their energy needs throughout the day, teens should eat at least three healthy meals, including a good breakfast. Teens often eat on the run. A wide variety of healthful foods available at home—such as fresh fruits, low-fat cheeses and yogurt, and cut-up raw vegetables with a low-fat bean dip or salsa—may help keep teens from eating the high-fat, high-sugar, high-calorie foods they normally reach for first. Sodas and diet sodas have little or no nutritional value.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Calcium*]\nTeens, especially girls, need to eat foods that are high in calcium, such as low-fat dairy products, fish with edible bones (such as salmon and sardines), and dark green vegetables (such as collard greens, broccoli, and kale). They should have three or more servings a day of calcium-rich foods. Nearly all of a person's total bone mass is formed by the end of the teen years. Children who don't take in enough calcium may not develop their maximum potential bone mass. Building optimal bone mass by doing weight-bearing exercise and eating foods high in calcium can help prevent or delay the onset of the bone-thinning disorder osteoporosis (see page 989) later in life.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Iron*]\nThe daily requirement for iron increases dramatically starting at age 10, especially between ages 11 and 18, because of increased muscle mass and an expanded volume of blood. Iron can be found in animal foods such as beef, chicken and turkey (especially the dark meat), or fish. Strict vegetarians (see page 43) can get their daily supply of iron from plant foods such as dried beans, leafy greens, nuts, and dried fruits, but they will have to eat a larger volume of them to get sufficient iron. Adolescent boys need more iron than when they were younger because of their increased growth rate. Girls need even more than boys to replace the iron lost during menstruation. Girls who lose a lot of blood during heavy menstrual periods are at risk of developing iron deficiency anemia (see page 610). Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include fatigue, ir", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "testosterone", "relation": "increases", "tail": "muscle and bone mass"}, {"head": "testosterone", "relation": "increases", "tail": "male sex hormone"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

Teenagers require more sleep—9 to 10 hours a day—than children who are even slightly younger, and more than most adults. It is normal for teenagers to have difficulty falling asleep in the evening and difficulty waking in the morning because their biological clock is “off” in the daytime when they should be awake, and “on” in the evening when they should be sleeping. Adolescents who get 6 to 7 hours of sleep a night fall asleep more often during the day, especially during sedentary activities (such as sitting in a classroom or driving). Cutting back on sleep, even by 1 or 2 hours, has been linked to poor school performance, irritability, and vehicle collisions. Over time, increased levels of the stress hormone\n\ncortisol (brought on by lack of sleep) can damage brain cells directly and cause memory and learning problems.\n\nExposure to bright light (about 30 to 40 minutes first thing in the morning) as well as going to bed and waking up at the same time every day can help reset an adolescent's biological clock. It also helps if teens leave a little time at the end of the day to unwind. They should also limit their intake of caffeine during the day and avoid exercising right before going to bed.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Getting Enough Sleep > Staying Healthy: What Can Parents Do?]\n- Provide nutritious, well-balanced meals (see page 36). Girls especially need to get enough calcium (1,200 to 1,500 milligrams a day) during adolescence to build strong bones.\n- Encourage your child to be physically active with activities such as walking, dancing, or sports.\n- Try to see that your child goes to bed and wakes up at about the same time on weekdays and weekends, and that he or she gets 9 to 10 hours of sleep every day.\n- Make sure that your teen does not take on too many activities. Think of ways to make his or her schedule more manageable, such as working fewer hours or dropping an activity. School, homework, sports, after-school activities, and a job may not provide time for an adequate amount of sleep, time with family, or nutritious meals.\n- Make appointments for your teenager for regular medical checkups. Girls need to start having regular pelvic examinations (see page 140) and Pap smears at age 18—younger if they are or are about to become sexually active, or if they have menstrual problems.\n- Make sure your child is aware of health self-examinations he or she should be performing regularly. Girls should begin doing monthly breast self-examinations (see page 138) by age 18. Boys should begin doing testicle self-examinations (see page 139) at puberty.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Getting Enough Sleep > Adolescent Sexuality]\nParents often have unrealistic views of their children's sexuality and are unaware that their children are sexually active. However, most adolescents experiment with relationships and sex and, by the time they graduate from high school, many have had sexual experiences. It is important for parents to talk with their children about relationships, including the roles of sex, self-respect, and love. The more knowledge adolescents have about sex (including about contraception and safer sex), the less likely they are to engage in irresponsible or early sexual activity. Parents who find it difficult to talk about sex (or are not sure what to say) should ask their doctor to talk to their teen for them or ask the doctor to recommend a book to give to the teenager on the subject. However, parents should be available and willing to discuss any questions their children (of any age) have.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Getting Enough Sleep > Pregnancy: A Responsibility of Both Partners]\nAdolescents who are having sex should actively prevent an unwanted pregnancy. Each year in the United States, nearly 800,000 unintended pregnancies occur in girls 15 to 19 years old. A boy and a girl should both use contraception (see page 470)—including for their first experience with sexual intercourse. It is possible for a girl to become pregnant even if she has not begun menstruating because the first egg could be released from an ovary (and fertilized by the boy's sperm) in the days before she has her first period.\n\nMost teenagers are not adequately educated about their reproductive potential and the risk of unintended pregnancy.

Having this knowledge can give your teen self-confidence and enable him or her to make responsible decisions about sex. Here are some tips:\n\n- Make sure your children are well informed about sex.\n- Encourage your children to ask questions about sex, and give them honest answers.\n- Stress that there are other ways than sex to have a close relationship with someone. Suggest going dancing or to movies, plays, or sporting events; participating in sports; or going out with a group of friends.\n- Explain the risks of oral sex. Many teenagers think they are “abstaining” from sex by engaging in nonintercourse sexual activities. They don’t realize that they can contract many sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)—including chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, genital warts, and HIV—through oral sex.\n- Explain the risks of sexual intercourse, including pregnancy and STDs. Teenagers also need to know where they can be treated for STDs, and that not all STDs can be cured. Emphasize the importance of reporting an STD to a doctor so that all of their sexual contacts can be located and treated. Stress that they themselves would want to know if they had been exposed to an STD, and that all such reports are kept confidential.\n- Inform your teen about all available contraceptive techniques (see page 470). Condoms help prevent pregnancy and provide some protection against STDs. If you are not sure about the facts, refer your child to a family planning\n\nclinic such as Planned Parenthood. Reassure your child that all health visits and records are confidential.\n\n- Accept your child's sexuality; if your child tells you that he or she is homosexual (or if you think he or she may be), accept the possibility and get information and support from a support organization such as Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Psychological, Emotional, and Behavioral Development]\nThe physical, mental, and emotional changes that take place during adolescence can make it an especially difficult time for both the adolescent and his or her parents. At the same time that relationships are getting more complicated, classes are getting harder and peer pressure is at its peak.\n\nIndependence is necessary for healthy growth, and it helps teens learn to make good choices. Most teens get through these years safely by learning through experience, sometimes making some bad choices that have no long-term, harmful consequences. Adolescents learn to become independent by expressing their individuality in a number of ways, such as through music, clothes, or hairstyles. These forms of rebellion are often part of a teenager's growth toward independence and maturity. In some cases, however, teens make poor choices, or their life experiences become too difficult for them to handle. Other teens may develop psychological or emotional problems that require treatment by mental health professionals.\n\nThe severity of a teen's behavior or emotions is usually what distinguishes the average teen from one who has psychological or emotional problems. Here are some ways to tell if your teen's behavior is normal or if he or she is having problems coping. Most teens:\n\n- Are sad sometimes or cry easily—but their mood eventually improves.\n- Worry about their appearance and experiment with diets or exercise programs—but don't jeopardize their health.\n- Skip a class or two—but not enough to fail a class or get poor grades.\n- Worry about their popularity—but not to the point where they are unable to deal with everyday life.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Mental and Emotional Health in Teens: What Can Parents Do?]\nAlthough their friends and peers are of increasing importance, for most teenagers, parents and family are the most important influences. Use your influence to help your children face the many choices and decisions they have to make at this time in their lives.\n\n- Be available, both physically and emotionally. Spend as much time as you can with your children.\n- Show affection. Hug or kiss your children or use words to show that you care about them.\n- Compliment teenagers often and tell them you are proud of them.\n- Set clear, reasonable expectations for your children.\n- Be a good role model. Behave in the way you want your children to behave.\n- Spend more time listening than talking. Showing an interest in what your children have to say makes them feel important and boosts their self-esteem.\n- Don't be judgmental. Accepting your children's ideas and feelings will make them more likely to confide in you.\n- Do not compare your child to other children.\n- Never ridicule your child.\n- Give advice, not orders.

The average smoker starts by age 12 and smokes daily by age 14. Teens usually start smoking because their friends do, they think it's cool, and it makes them seem older. Boys often think it makes them look manly, and many girls do it to look glamorous and to control their weight.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Smoking and Using Tobacco > What Teens Should Know About Smoking and Tobacco]\nTeens who smoke rarely respond to warnings about the health effects of smoking because most problems develop only after many years of smoking. Try to get your teen to stop smoking or using other tobacco products (or not to start) by stressing the negative effects that are most important to him or her now:\n\n- **Attractiveness** Few teens want to date someone who smokes. They say that seeing someone smoke turns them off and that they don't like being around smokers.\n- **Image** Smoking causes bad breath; stained teeth; smelly hair and clothes; wrinkled, dry skin; and red, itchy, watery eyes. Smokeless tobacco can cause cracked lips and sores around the mouth. Teens who smoke produce more than twice as much phlegm as nonsmokers.\n- **Enjoyment** Smoking ruins the smell and taste of food, for the smoker and for others.\n- **Endurance** All forms of tobacco, including smokeless tobacco and cigars, can affect endurance and overall athletic performance by\n\nnarrowing blood vessels, straining the heart, and reducing oxygen to the muscles and lungs.\n\n- **Poison factor** Cigarettes contain poisons such as nicotine (which is also used in insecticides to kill insects), formaldehyde (the chemical used in biology classes to preserve dead animals), and cyanide (the same chemical found in rat poison).\n- **Cost** It's expensive to smoke.\n\nFor some teens, using tobacco can be an early warning sign of other problems. Smoking is associated with high-risk behaviors such as fighting and having unprotected sex. Teens who smoke are more likely than nonsmokers to drink alcohol, smoke marijuana, or use cocaine.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Alcohol and Other Drugs]\nAlcohol is the drug most commonly abused by teens. Many teens drink alcohol regularly and, of those who do, many drink heavily. Binge drinking (having more than five drinks in a session for males or four drinks in a session for females) is a serious problem on most college campuses. Almost half of teens have tried marijuana. Other drugs less frequently abused by teens include amphetamines, heroin, and cocaine (see page 737).\n\nProblems with alcohol and other drugs are occurring at increasingly younger ages. Teens whose parents use alcohol or other drugs are more likely to use them too. Teens use alcohol and other drugs for some of the same reasons adults do—they think it will relax them, give them self-confidence, or help them feel better temporarily. Some teens try alcohol and drugs out of curiosity, or because their friends do and they want to fit in. Many teens who abuse alcohol or drugs have behavioral problems or learning disabilities (see page 415).\n\nThe average teen may experiment with alcohol or marijuana but will not use it regularly. If drug use progresses beyond the stage of experimentation, the teen's behavior will be affected as getting high becomes more and more important. Young people are especially vulnerable to the effects of drug use because their body and brain are still developing. As teens become psychologically or physically dependent on drugs, they tend to spend a lot of time alone or disappear for long periods, and their friends and interests change. They often become depressed and unmotivated and their grades fall. Drug use can also lead to hostility, violence, and delinquency.\n\nIt's hard for teens to deal with drug or alcohol abuse problems by themselves. They might think that they don't drink much or that addictions happen only to other people. Here are some steps you can take to help a teen realize that he or she may have a substance abuse problem:\n\n- Find out before you talk to the teen where he or she could go for help. Be prepared to offer the information.\n- Tell the teen at an appropriate time (preferably when he or she is not under the influence) that you think alcohol or other drugs are causing problems for him or her and you are worried and want to help.\n- Don't accuse the teen of being an alcoholic or drug addict, and don't blame him or her for the problem.\n- Don't show pity or be condescending.\n- Give examples of what you've seen him or her do when he or she is high.\n- Be prepared for the teen's anger and denials.\n- Encourage the teen to talk to other people who have recovered from substance abuse problems.\n- Try to get the teen to see a counselor who specializes in substance abuse problems. The child's safety, health, and life may depend on it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Inhalants*]\nAn increasing ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "smoking", "relation": "treats", "tail": "health effects"}, {"head": "smoking", "relation": "causes", "tail": "problems"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "teens", "relation": "participate in", "tail": "[Event: smoking]"}, {"head": "teens", "relation": "respond to", "tail": "[Event: warnings about health effects]"}, {"head": "parents", "relation": "try to get their teen to stop", "tail": "[Event: smoking or using other tobacco products]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: many years of smoking]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: health problems develop]"}, {"head": "[Event: warnings about health effects]", "relation": "are ignored by", "tail": "[Event: teens who smoke]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Hold them and administer them to your child inside the home, and do not allow your child to take medicine to school unless your doctor has told you it is necessary. If your child must take his or her medicine at school, make sure the medicine is held by the school nurse and administered in his or her presence or in the presence of a school official. If your child is attending day care, camp, or a sleepover, give his or her medicine to a responsible adult to give to your child when needed.\n\nMethylphenidate can be dangerous if snorted, injected, or taken in large doses. The drug can increase heart rate and blood pressure and, in severe cases, cause an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia; see page 580) that can result in sudden death. Complications from injecting the drug include overdose, blood clots, infections, lung problems, and skin and circulatory problems. Injecting crushed tablets of the drug can cause permanent lung damage.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > Irresponsible Driving]\nMotor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death of teenagers in the United States. Most teens believe they are good drivers. The main reasons for irresponsible driving are immaturity and lack of driving experience—the crash risk for a 16-year-old is more than twice that of an 18- or 19-year-old. Two out of three teens killed in motor vehicle crashes are boys. However, the crash rate for teenage girls is approaching that of boys.\n\nThe majority of motor vehicle deaths are caused by driving while under the influence of alcohol. One out of five teenage drivers has driven while drunk, and one out of five teens involved in fatal crashes had been drinking. Other factors in addition to drinking that contribute to motor vehicle injuries or deaths are speeding, not wearing a seat belt, and being distracted while driving. Three out of four teens admit to speeding while driving, and many teens say they rarely or never wear a seat belt. Being distracted can contribute to or cause a collision; cars carrying two or more teens are four times more likely to be involved in a collision than cars carrying only the teen driver.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Safe Driving: Tips for Parents of Teens Who Drive]\nTo reduce collisions and injuries, many states are establishing graduated licensing systems in which full driving privileges are phased in for 16-year-olds. In the initial phase, the teen may be allowed to drive only with adult supervision, and parents must certify that their child has driven a specified number of hours (usually 25 to 50 hours) under supervision. In the next phase, the teen is able to drive without adult supervision but may be restricted from driving at night or from driving with nonadult passengers. These phases usually last about 6 months, but may last longer depending on the state. Many states require driver education as part of their graduated licensing system.\n\n- Have your teen drive under supervision (with an adult in the car as a passenger) for at least 50 hours before letting him or her get a driver's license. Observe his or her driving in all kinds of weather conditions and traffic situations.\n- Establish rules early for safe driving. Take away your child's driving privileges if he or she breaks a rule, especially if he or she gets a speeding ticket or causes a collision.\n- Set a good example by following all traffic rules and by controlling your anger on the road.\n- Have your teen drive a nonflashy, nonsporty car. He or she will be less likely to show off or speed.\n- Tell your teen to call for a ride any time he or she (or another driver) is not capable of driving, no matter the circumstances, including drinking. Assure him or her that there will be no consequences or punishment.\n- Remind your teen to follow all traffic rules—such as wearing a seat belt at all times, not speeding, not weaving in and out of traffic, and especially not drinking any alcohol before getting behind the wheel. He or she also should insist that all passengers wear seat belts.\n- Remind your teen of the importance of focusing on driving and of avoiding unnecessary distractions such as talking on the phone, adjusting the radio or CD player, putting on makeup, eating, or looking at a map. He or she should pull over to use the phone or study maps or notes for directions.\n\n- Discourage your child from driving or riding on a motorcycle. If he or she does, insist that he or she wear a helmet and other proper equipment or clothing.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Depression]\nFeeling sad or down every once in a while is normal, but being depressed is not a normal part of adolescence.

Exposure to violence (either actual or through media such as movies) can rewire a child's brain in ways that can make him or her more prone to aggressive behavior later in life. There is no precise profile of someone who will commit acts of violence but, in addition to exposure to violence, risk factors include alcohol or drug abuse, being a victim of child abuse or neglect, being a gang member, and having access to a gun. In the United States, guns are responsible for most of the deaths of people between ages 15 and 24. Violent behavior usually peaks by age 16 or 17, but the vast majority of teens who have been violent stop committing violent acts by the time they are 21.\n\nIt is usually the interaction of a number of influences over time that can make a teen violent. Good parenting and the love and acceptance of even just one caring adult can often help teens gain confidence and social skills, set positive goals to strive for, and serve as buffers against potentially harmful biological or environmental influences.\n\n**WARNING!**\n\n**Could Your Child Become Violent?**\n\nViolent teens may show signs of having emotional or behavioral problems long before they behave violently. Consult a doctor or mental health professional if a child or teen:\n\n- Damages property\n- Hurts animals\n- Frequently loses his or her temper or gets into fights\n- Carries a weapon or is a member of a gang\n- Bullies another child (or is being bullied)\n- Abuses alcohol or other drugs\n- Is easily frustrated and feels that he or she is being treated unfairly\n- Has low self-esteem and seems depressed\n- Seems to have no friends and is often alone\n- Is verbally abusive or threatens others\n- Is truant or has a history of discipline problems in school\n- Has extreme mood swings or has talked about committing suicide\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Bullying*]\nNearly half of all schoolchildren are bullied by another student at some time during their education. Bullying is defined as a pattern of repeated aggression against or negative behavior toward a person. Boys are more likely to be bullies than girls, and boys usually bully other boys; girls tend to bully other girls. Bullying can take the form of physical attacks (such as hitting, kicking, or pushing), verbal attacks (such as name-calling, insults, or teasing), or psychological attacks (such as intimidation, spreading rumors, or persuading other children to reject or exclude the child). Boys who are bullies usually use physical force or threats, while girls are more likely to use verbal or psychological attacks.\n\nBullies are usually children who have themselves been victims of physical abuse or bullying, usually at home. They tend to be aggressive, controlling, and dominating, and often have an inflated self-image and difficulty empathizing with other people. By contrast, the victims of bullying tend to be introverted, passive, and easily intimidated, and frequently are seen by classmates as being different in some way (such as by race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, academic ability, or unusual haircut or clothing).\n\nIf you think that your child is a victim of bullying, or if you are concerned that your child may be a bully, quickly take steps to stop it. Bullying can have long-term\n\nconsequences for both victims and bullies. Victims of bullying often try to avoid going to school, and their academic performance may suffer. Many victims have difficulty socializing, have low self-esteem, and frequently become isolated and depressed. In extreme cases, victims may consider or attempt suicide (see previous page). Children who are bullies are more likely than other children to be truant from school, drop out of school, or get into fights. They also are more likely than other children to commit a crime (such as vandalism, shoplifting, or drug-related offenses) by the time they are 24.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Bullying* > **If your child is being bullied:**]\n- **Believe your child.** Reassure your child and make sure he or she knows that you care. Listen to what he or she has to say, and ask questions so you can get a clear understanding of the situation.\n- **Get help.** Talk to your child's teacher and the school principal, and ask them to investigate the situation. They may be able to reduce the incidence of bullying by increasing supervision in areas where it is most likely to occur, including hallways, bathrooms, locker rooms, playgrounds, and school buses.\n\n- **Encourage your child to be assertive.** Tell your child to get immediate help from an adult when he or she is confronted by a bully.

A satisfying sexual relationship is one of the most important aspects of life. The shared intimacy of sex can be a physically and emotionally rewarding experience. Sexual arousal is influenced by our feelings of attraction to another person and involves physical responses such as an erection or vaginal lubrication.\n\nSexual arousal affects the whole body. The skin is highly sensitive to arousal, especially the skin over the upper and inner thighs, the lower back, and the buttocks. During arousal, the genitals, earlobes, and nipples in both men and women become erect, and the lining of the nose becomes swollen and engorged with blood. The contractions of orgasm affect many muscles in the body, including those in the legs, back, neck, face, and toes.\n\nBecause the female sex organs are more interior than the male sex organs, some women may be unfamiliar with their own genitals. If you are a woman who has never seen her external genitals, you can look at them with a small mirror held between your legs. Your pubic hair covers the protective tissue known as the mons pubis, which lies over the external genitals. Underneath are two folds of skin called the outer lips or labia. Inside the outer labia are two inner lips, which cover the openings to the urinary tract and the vagina. The clitoris, the principal site of female sexual stimulation, is at the top, where the inner lips meet; the clitoris, like a man's penis, becomes erect and swollen during sexual arousal. The vagina is a long, muscular canal that extends (at an angle) from the outside of the body up to the uterus. At the upper end of the vagina is the cervix, which is the opening of the uterus. During arousal, the vagina produces a fluid that lubricates it and makes penetration by the penis easier.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sexuality > The female sex organs]\nMost of the female reproductive system is internal—and only the genitals are visible. The outer, visible area is called the vulva, which includes the mons pubis (the hair-covered mound over the pubic bone); the outer, hair-covered lips (labia majora); and the smaller, inner lips (labia minora), which protect the opening to the vagina. The clitoris is a tiny, sexually sensitive mound of tissue. During sexual arousal, the clitoris,\n\nthe labia minora, the vagina, and the network of connecting blood vessels and muscles swell with blood.\n\n![Diagram of the male external genitalia showing the Mons pubis, Outer labia, Inner labia, Clitoris, Opening to urethra, and Opening to vagina.]()![](_page_841_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nFor the most part, the male sex organs are external. The penis passes urine out of the body and expels semen (a mixture of sperm and secretions from the seminal vesicles and prostate gland) at orgasm. When a male is unaroused sexually, the penis is soft, but during arousal, blood rushes into the penis, making it swollen and erect. Sperm are produced in the testicles, two round, firm spheres enclosed in a pouch of skin called the scrotum. The testicles are outside the body because they must be cooler than body temperature to produce sperm. The left testicle usually hangs slightly lower than the right testicle. On top of each testicle is a coiled tube called the epididymis, in which sperm develop.\n\nFrom the back of each testicle, a long, thin tube called the vas deferens extends up into an organ called the ampulla of the vas deferens, which is behind the bladder. The ampulla of the vas deferens stores sperm for up to several months. Right before ejaculation, sperm exit the ampulla and mix with secretions from the seminal vesicles. As the mixture enters the urethra (the tube inside the penis through which urine passes out of the body), it combines with secretions from the prostate gland. This final mixture is called semen. The penis ejects semen as orgasm begins.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sexuality > The male sex organs]\nThe penis and the testicles are the most visible parts of the male reproductive system. The testicles are suspended in a pouch of skin called the scrotum. The testicles produce sperm and the male sex hormone testosterone. During sexual arousal, spongy tissue inside the penis becomes engorged with blood. Sperm travel from the testicles through a duct called the vas deferens into a pair of sacs called the seminal vesicles. The prostate gland and seminal vesicles produce a fluid that combines with the sperm to create semen—the fluid that is ejaculated at orgasm.\n\n![Diagram of the male reproductive system showing labeled parts: Bladder, Seminal vesicle, Prostate gland, Pubic bone, Vas deferens, Urethra, Spongy erectile tissue, Penis, Epididymis, Testicle, and Scrotum.]()![](_page_842_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Sexual Response Cycle]\nMen and women experience a pr", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "sexuality", "relation": "affects", "tail": "sexual arousal"}, {"head": "sexual arousal", "relation": "influences", "tail": "physical responses"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

During orgasm, heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure reach their highest levels. The skin may become flushed or appear to have a rash. In women, the muscles in the vagina contract rhythmically, producing pleasurable sensations. The uterus also contracts during orgasm. Women are capable of having multiple orgasms.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Orgasm > What Happens During Orgasm?]\nOrgasm can be defined as a peak of pressure in the blood vessels and tissues of the genitals that is characterized by pleasurable muscle contractions in the genitals and over the entire body.\n\nWhen a woman reaches orgasm, the muscles in the lower third of the vagina contract repeatedly, while those in the upper third expand. The uterus also contracts during orgasm. To achieve orgasm, a woman must get sufficient stimulation at the base of her clitoris, but only 20 to 30 percent of all women are able to reach orgasm during intercourse with penetration of the penis alone. For a woman, having an orgasm during intercourse depends on the anatomy of both partners and the activity they engage in. Some couples fit together and move in a way that stimulates the clitoris; others do not. If you are a woman who has difficulty having an orgasm during intercourse, ask your partner to stimulate your clitoris with a finger, the mouth, or a vibrator beforehand so you can be sufficiently aroused. You can also try different positions to see if they are more stimulating, or masturbate during\n\npenetration. Many women can achieve orgasm more easily when they are on top.\n\nWhen a man becomes sexually aroused, his brain sends signals to relax the muscles in his penis so blood can rush in and fill the penis sufficiently to produce an erection. Just before orgasm, the muscles around the base of the penis contract to help eject semen from the penis. After these pleasurable muscle contractions, he enters a period of relaxation in which he cannot respond to sexual stimulation.\n\nThe male orgasm occurs in two parts. First, semen collects in the urethra and the man feels that orgasm is inevitable. Then the penis contracts and expels the semen. Each ejaculation contains from 300 million to 500 million sperm, but only a few hundred will reach the woman's fallopian tubes.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Resolution]\nDuring the resolution stage, the heightened state of arousal reverts to normal. The sex organs return to their normal size. Breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure decrease to their normal levels. This process usually takes longer for women, and women can be stimulated to reach another orgasm during this stage. Men go through a refractory period during which they cannot have another orgasm until a certain amount of time has passed. This refractory period can last from minutes to hours depending on the man's age and physical condition.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sexual Orientation]\nSexual orientation is a term that refers to a person's emotional, romantic, and sexual attraction to a person of a particular gender. People who are attracted to members of the opposite sex are called heterosexual, while those who are attracted to people of the same sex are called homosexual, gay (men and women), or lesbian (women). Some people are attracted to both men and women; they are called bisexual. It is difficult to determine the exact number of people in the United States who identify themselves as homosexual or bisexual.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Bisexuality and Homosexuality]\nThe factors that influence a person's sexual orientation are not completely understood, but they appear to encompass a complex combination of biological, psychological, and social influences. What is clear is that sexual orientation is not a lifestyle choice that can easily be changed. Most people discover at a very early age—in childhood or adolescence—before they have had any sexual experiences, that they are attracted to people of a certain gender.\n\nTo avoid the social stigma sometimes attached to being homosexual, some gay people try hard to change their sexual orientation, usually without success. No scientific evidence shows that trying to alter one's sexual orientation is an appropriate goal of psychological or psychiatric treatment. Homosexuality and bisexuality are not mental disorders or emotional problems. Doctors view homosexuality and bisexuality as normal variations of human sexual expression. Most emotional problems that occur in homosexuals are caused by a sense of alienation from living in an unaccepting environment.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Discrimination and Coming Out]\nGay people frequently face discrimination and stereotyping in the United States. Hate crimes and similar acts of violence pose a genuine threat. Between 5 and 10 percent of gay people report having experienced physical assault or abuse because of their sexual orientation, and almost half have been victims", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Orgasm", "relation": "is the climax stage of", "tail": "the sexual response cycle"}, {"head": "heart rate", "relation": "reach their highest levels during", "tail": "orgasm"}, {"head": "breathing", "relation": "reach their highest levels during", "tail": "orgasm"}, {"head": "blood pressure", "relation": "reach their highest levels during", "tail": "orgasm"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "women", "relation": "are capable of having multiple", "tail": "[Event: orgasms]"}, {"head": "the muscles in the vagina", "relation": "contract rhythmically producing pleasurable sensations during", "tail": "[Event: orgasm]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: heart rate reaches its highest level]", "relation": "during", "tail": "[Event: orgasm]"}, {"head": "[Event: breathing reaches its highest level]", "relation": "during", "tail": "[Event: orgasm]"}, {"head": "[Event: blood pressure reaches its highest level]", "relation": "during", "tail": "[Event: orgasm]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Some contraceptives require a prescription, while others are available over the counter. Be sure to talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of each method of birth control before choosing one. Consider reliability, side effects, and protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs; see page 477) when making your decision. Remember that hormonal and barrier methods of birth control do not protect against STDs. Doctors strongly recommend that women who use these birth-control methods and are not in a mutually monogamous\n\nrelationship also use condoms during sexual intercourse to protect themselves from STDs.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Oral Contraceptives]\nThe contraceptive pill (birth-control pill) is currently the most effective method of reversible birth control. The most frequently prescribed birth-control pills are called combined pills because they blend synthetic versions of estrogen and progesterone (progestin). Estrogen and progesterone are the major hormones that control the female reproductive cycle.\n\nBirth-control pills work primarily by preventing ovulation, the monthly release of an egg by the ovaries. The pills also make it difficult for sperm to enter the uterus by making the mucus produced by the cervix thicker and harder to penetrate. Birth-control pills regulate a woman's menstrual cycle by providing a controlled dose of hormones daily. Most women notice changes in their menstrual cycle when they take birth-control pills—their periods occur precisely every 28 days and usually are shorter and lighter. Many women take birth-control pills specifically to regulate their cycle and reduce menstrual flow, not just for contraception.\n\nIn addition to preventing pregnancy, birth-control pills have other beneficial effects. A woman who takes birth-control pills is much less likely to have ovarian cysts (see page 864), breast lumps (see page 856), iron deficiency anemia (see page 610), rheumatoid arthritis (see page 918), or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID; see page 871) than a woman who does not take birth-control pills. Birth-control pills also protect against cancer of the ovary, uterus, and colon. The combined pill, because it contains estrogen, helps maintain bone density in women who are at risk for osteoporosis (see page 989) and can prevent ectopic pregnancies (see page 523).\n\nBirth-control pills are packaged in 21-day or 28-day packs. The pills you take for the first 3 weeks contain the hormones that prevent pregnancy and regulate your menstrual cycle. The pills you take during the fourth week are inactive (placebo) pills. You take one pill every day at the same time. After you take the last of the hormone-containing pills, the hormone levels in your blood fall quickly, and menstrual bleeding occurs. If you miss a pill, you should take it as soon as you remember. If you miss two or more pills from one package, take two pills a day until you catch up, but use an additional method of birth control until you begin a new package of pills. When you miss a pill, the\n\nsudden withdrawal of the hormones can cause menstrual bleeding. Birth-control pills do not have any effect on your ability to become pregnant after you stop taking them.\n\nIf your doctor has recommended against taking the combined pill, you may be able to take the minipill. The minipill contains only the hormone progesterone (progestin) and may be safer if you smoke and are over age 35. (Women over 35 who smoke cigarettes should not take estrogen because it can increase their risk of blood clots and stroke.) Because the minipill does not contain estrogen, it can cause breakthrough bleeding (bleeding between periods), especially if you miss a pill or take one late. Some women who take the minipill do not have regular menstrual periods for a long time. Minipills are slightly less effective than combined birth-control pills; on average, about 2 of every 100 women who use the minipill for a year become pregnant.\n\nYour doctor probably will tell you to begin taking the ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Hepatitis A", "relation": "vaccinated against", "tail": "hepatitis A"}, {"head": "Hepatitis B", "relation": "vaccinated against", "tail": "hepatitis B"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "Patient", "relation": "tested for", "tail": "[Event: STDs]"}, {"head": "Doctor", "relation": "tests", "tail": "[Event: STDs]"}, {"head": "Person", "relation": "practices safer sex", "tail": "[Event: safe sex]"}, {"head": "Person", "relation": "gets vaccinated", "tail": "[Event: vaccination]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: unprotected sex]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: STDs]"}, {"head": "[Event: alcohol use]", "relation": "increases risk of", "tail": "[Event: unprotected sex]"}]}, "status": "success"}

They are available over the counter as cream, jelly, or foam and are inserted into the vagina shortly before intercourse. Follow the package directions and reinsert more spermicide before each time you have intercourse. Always use a spermicide with a condom, a diaphragm, or a cervical cap. Very rarely, spermicides can cause mild allergic reactions, producing itching and redness in either partner's genital area.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragm]\nThe diaphragm is a rubber cup fitted over a flexible wire frame that blocks sperm from entering the uterus. A trained health care professional fits a diaphragm to a woman's vagina to cover the cervix (the opening to the uterus) and shows her how to use it. A diaphragm must be inserted correctly and no more than 6 hours before intercourse. You must put a ring of spermicidal cream or jelly around the edge of the diaphragm and about half a teaspoon in its center before you insert it. To insert it, you squeeze it together into a half circle. Check immediately after insertion to make sure that the rubber of the diaphragm covers your cervix and that the edge of the diaphragm is behind your pubic bone. If the diaphragm does not cover your cervix, it will not block sperm from the uterus and you can become pregnant.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragm > Using a diaphragm]\nBefore using your diaphragm, place some spermicide around the rim and in the center of the cup (top). When inserted properly, the diaphragm completely covers the cervix, and the rim of the diaphragm lies behind your pubic bone (bottom).\n\n![Diagram showing a hand holding a tube labeled 'Spermicide' and applying it to a 'Diaphragm'.]()![](_page_853_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n![Diagram showing a cross-section of the female reproductive system (Uterus and Vagina) with a 'Diaphragm in place against cervix'.]()![](_page_853_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nAfter intercourse, you must leave the diaphragm in place for at least 6 hours to allow the spermicide to kill any sperm. If you have intercourse again within 6 hours, put more spermicidal cream or jelly in your vagina, using the plastic applicator that comes with the spermicide. For intercourse after 6 hours, remove the diaphragm, wash it, put spermicidal cream or jelly on it again, and reposition it in your vagina. The diaphragm can be a highly effective method of birth control if you use it carefully and consistently.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragm > Cervical Cap]\nThe cervical cap, like the diaphragm, blocks sperm from the uterus. The cap is much smaller than the diaphragm and fits tightly over the cervix (the opening to the uterus) rather than extending to the walls of the vagina. A trained health care professional fits the cervical cap to each woman and instructs her in how to insert it. The cervical cap should be used in the same way as a diaphragm, with spermicidal cream or jelly, following the same precautions. Used in this way, a cervical cap is about as effective as\n\na diaphragm in preventing pregnancy. However, the smaller size of the cap can make it trickier to place correctly, especially for women who have short fingers.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragm > Cervical cap]\nThe cervical cap is a barrier method of birth control. Like a diaphragm but smaller, the cap completely covers the cervix, blocking sperm from entering the uterus.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the cervical cap inserted into the vagina, covering the cervix, and blocking the uterus. Labels include: Cap in position over cervix, Uterus, and Vagina.]()![](_page_854_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diaphragm > IUD]\nThe intrauterine device (IUD) is a tiny contraceptive device made of copper or a hormone-containing plastic that your doctor inserts into your uterus. An IUD prevents pregnancy by blocking sperm from the fallopian tubes, where fertilization normally takes place. An IUD is usually inserted during a woman's menstrual period, when the cervix (the opening to the uterus) is more open, but it can be inserted at any time of the menstrual cycle once the doctor determines that the woman is not pregnant.\n\nThe insertion takes only a few minutes, but it sometimes causes brief cramping pain. Once inserted, the IUD protects against pregnancy. An IUD can be accidentally expelled at any time, so you should check frequently to make sure it is still in place. A good time to check is toward the end of your period (because both menstrual cramps and tampon insertion and removal can increase the risk of expulsion). You can check for the IUD by inserting your finger inside your vagina; if you can feel the string, the IUD is in place. If you feel the hard plastic of the IUD, it is being expelled. See your doctor so he or she can remove the IUD and replace it with a new one.\n\nThe most common problem with copper IUDs is the slight risk of increased menstrual bleeding and intensified menstrual pain, although most users do not experience these pro", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Spermicides", "relation": "treats", "tail": "mild allergic reactions"}, {"head": "Spermicides", "relation": "used with", "tail": "condom"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

The ring continuously releases estrogen and a form of progestosterone (progestin) to inhibit ovulation and block implantation of a fertilized egg. The ring stays in place for 3 weeks, and you remove it for the week that you have your period. You insert a new ring at the end of the fourth week. The ring is easier to insert and remove than a diaphragm (see page 471) because it does not require special positioning over the cervix. It is 99 percent effective in preventing pregnancy (but check regularly to make sure it has not been accidentally expelled).\n\nSide effects of the vaginal ring include vaginal discharge or discomfort, or the sensation of a foreign body inside the vagina. Like the birth-control pill, the vaginal ring can increase the risk of blood clots, heart attack, and stroke, especially in women over age 35 who smoke cigarettes.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Natural Methods]\nThe natural method of contraception, sometimes called the rhythm method, attempts to prevent pregnancy by predicting the day in the menstrual cycle when a woman will ovulate and abstaining from intercourse on the potentially unsafe days before and after. Intercourse on the day of ovulation and 3 to 4 days before and after carries a high risk of conception because sperm can live in a woman's body for as long as 6 days after intercourse (an average of 4 days). A sperm can fertilize an egg during the first 24 hours after ovulation.\n\nNatural birth-control methods are the least reliable form of contraception because they depend on an estimate of the time of ovulation; each woman's menstrual cycle can vary from month to month, and some women may ovulate more than once during a cycle. You will need to keep records over several months to be able to accurately estimate the pattern of your cycle. There are several ways to calculate the time of ovulation, which occurs in most women about 14 days before the first day of their period.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Temperature Method*]\nIn most women, morning temperature (called basal body temperature) rises slightly just after ovulation and does not fall again until shortly before their period begins. Take your temperature each day as soon as you wake up—before you get out of bed or eat or drink anything—using a special thermometer designed to record small changes in temperature. Keep a chart of each temperature recording to determine your pattern of ovulation. Avoid intercourse from the first day of a period until 3 full days after the temperature rise. The disadvantages to this method are that you have no warning when ovulation will occur, and temperature readings can be inaccurate.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Ovulation-Predictor Kits]\nOvulation-predictor kits are available over the counter to help you determine when you are ovulating. To use, hold a test strip under your stream of urine and check the strip's change of color according to the package directions. To prevent pregnancy, avoid having intercourse for 3 to 4 days before and after ovulation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Ovulation-Predictor Kits > *Mucus-Inspection Method*]\nAbout 4 days before ovulation, the mucus from the cervix becomes thin, clear, sticky, and plentiful, similar to the consistency of egg whites. To prevent pregnancy, avoid intercourse from the time the wet mucus appears until 4 days after the mucus becomes noticeably reduced and drier after ovulation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Ovulation-Predictor Kits > *Mucothermal Method*]\nThe mucothermal method combines the temperature method and the mucus-inspection method (see previous page). It is the most reliable natural method, especially when performed with the guidance of a trained health care professional. But you must avoid intercourse for at least 3 days after your temperature rises and for 4 days after your mucus thins.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Ovulation-Predictor Kits > *Calendar Method*]\nThe calendar method is the least reliable natural method. To detect ovulation, you keep an accurate record of the lengths of your cycles for at least 12 months. Count the first day of your period as day 1. Subtract 20 days from your shortest menstrual cycle to determine the first day of your fertile time and then subtract 10 days from your longest cycle to find the last day of your fertile time each month. The calendar method is impractical if you have an irregular menstrual cycle; you would need to abstain from intercourse most days of the month.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sterilization]\nIf you are certain that you do not want children in the future, sterilization is an almost completely safe and reliable form of birth control. Most doctors recommend male rather than female sterilization because it carries less risk and is simpler to perform.

Although most STDs are transmitted through vaginal or anal intercourse, other forms of sexual contact, such as oral sex, can also transmit some STDs. Although anyone who is sexually active can contract an STD, about two thirds of people who have STDs are age 25 or younger. About 15 million new STD cases occur each year in the United States.\n\nFactors that increase your risk of contracting an STD include having more than one sex partner, having a sex partner who has more than one sex partner, not using condoms (see next page), and having a history of other STDs. To reduce your risk of contracting an STD, abstain from sex or limit the number of sex partners you have and use a latex condom every time you have vaginal, oral, or anal sex.\n\nAll STDs can be treated, and most can be cured. If you have symptoms or think that you may have been exposed to an STD, contact your doctor, your local health department, or an STD or family planning clinic (such as Planned Parenthood) for confidential testing and treatment. If you are sexually active and are not in a monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner, you should be tested for STDs regularly. Because STDs often occur together, people who have one STD should be tested for others.\n\nWhile you are being treated for an STD, you still can pass the infection to a sex partner. And even after successful treatment, you can easily become reinfected through sexual contact with an infected partner. For these reasons, your doctor will recommend that you and your partner be treated at the same time and that you both avoid all sexual contact until your treatment has been completed and you have no symptoms. Your doctor will tell you when it is safe to resume sexual activity.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Safer Sex]\nAbstinence (not having sex) is the only sure way to protect yourself from STDs. However, if you are sexually active, taking the following precautions will significantly reduce your risk of contracting an STD:\n\n- Have sex with only one partner who has sex only with you. Ask all potential sex partners about their sexual history and intravenous (IV) drug use before becoming physically intimate.\n- Use a latex condom every time you have vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Use only water-based lubricants. Do not use a condom after its expiration date or if it has been damaged in any way. Never reuse a condom.\n\n- Keep in mind that STDs can be transmitted during sex using sexual aids or body parts other than the penis, such as fingers.\n- Note that although spermicides kill some infectious microorganisms, they are formulated to kill sperm and are meant to be used along with condoms, not as a substitute. In addition, spermicides (including those containing nonoxynol-9) are not effective in preventing STDs, including HIV infection.\n\nAlthough condoms provide effective protection against most STDs, they cannot always completely block contact with the bacteria or viruses that cause STDs. For this reason, always look for any signs of STDs, such as sores on the penis or around the vagina, in your sex partner. Because STDs do not always produce obvious signs, ask your partner directly. If you still have any doubts, don't have sex.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Chlamydia]\nChlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States. It is caused by infection with the bacterium *Chlamydia trachomatis*, which is usually transmitted during vaginal or anal sex and, less frequently, during oral sex. In women, the bacteria can infect the urethra, the uterus and cervix, the fallopian tubes, the anus, and the conjunctiva (the mucous membrane that covers the white of the eye and lines the inside of the eyelids). In men, the bacteria can infect the urethra, the epididymis, the prostate gland, the anus, and the conjunctiva.\n\nIn women, untreated chlamydia can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (see page 871), which can cause infertility. The infection can also cause inflammation of the urethra (nongonococcal urethritis; see page 481) in women. In men, chlamydia is one of the leading causes of urethritis. If not treated, the infection can lead to inflammation of the prostate gland (prostatitis; see ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Looped", "relation": "treats", "tail": "Sexually Transmitted Diseases"}, {"head": "Pinched", "relation": "treats", "tail": "Sexually Transmitted Diseases"}, {"head": "Burned", "relation": "treats", "tail": "Sexually Transmitted Diseases"}, {"head": "Cut", "relation": "treats", "tail": "Sexually Transmitted Diseases"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "OLDER PEOPLE", "relation": "experiences", "tail": "[Event: Looped and banded]"}, {"head": "OLDER PEOPLE", "relation": "experiences", "tail": "[Event: Pinched with clip]"}, {"head": "OLDER PEOPLE", "relation": "experiences", "tail": "[Event: Burned]"}, {"head": "OLDER PEOPLE", "relation": "experiences", "tail": "[Event: Cut and tied]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

If symptoms develop, it is usually within 1 to 3 weeks after exposure to the bacteria. In men, possible symptoms can include pain during urination, burning or itching around the urethra, a discharge from the penis, or swelling of the testicles. In women, possible symptoms can include pain in the lower abdomen, pain during sexual intercourse, vaginal discharge, and bleeding between menstrual periods. Women are less likely to have symptoms than men, but are more likely to experience long-term complications—such as infertility—as a result of the infection. Also, a pregnant woman who has chlamydia can pass the infection to her baby during delivery, which can cause pneumonia or conjunctivitis in the newborn.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose chlamydia, a doctor uses a swab to obtain a sample of discharge from a man's urethra or a woman's cervix, for examination under a microscope. The doctor probably will order laboratory tests of a sample of urine and samples of cells taken from the penis, cervix, urethra, or anus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nTo treat chlamydia, a doctor may prescribe an antibiotic such as azithromycin or doxycycline. Because people with chlamydia may also have an STD called gonorrhea (see next page), doctors frequently prescribe a combination of antibiotics to treat both infections at the same time. In some cases, the antibiotics may be administered intravenously (through a vein) in the hospital. Both you and your partner should be treated to help ensure that the infection is eliminated. Your doctor will ask you to avoid all sexual contact until treatment is completed and you have no symptoms. Ask your doctor when you can safely resume sexual activity.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Trichomoniasis]\nTrichomoniasis is a common sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by Trichomonas vaginalis, a tiny, one-cell parasite. In women, the microorganism infects the vagina. In men, it can infect the urethra, the epididymis, the prostate gland, or the bladder. Five million new cases of trichomoniasis occur each year in women and men in the United States. Because the infection is usually transmitted through intercourse, it is likely that your sex partner also has the infection if you have it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Trichomoniasis > *Symptoms*]\nIn women, trichomoniasis produces a frothy, yellow-green vaginal discharge, often with a strong odor. Itching and irritation may develop in the vaginal area. The infection can also cause discomfort during intercourse or urination. In a pregnant woman, trichomoniasis can cause preterm delivery (see page 529). Although most men with trichomoniasis do not have symptoms, some men may experience irritation inside the urethra, a mild discharge from the penis, or a mild burning sensation after ejaculation or urination. If the infection spreads to the epididymis, it can cause pain in the testicles. Even without symptoms, men with trichomoniasis can infect their sex partner.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Trichomoniasis > *Diagnosis*]\nTo diagnose trichomoniasis in a woman, a doctor will perform a pelvic examination and take a sample of vaginal secretions for laboratory analysis. To diagnose trichomoniasis in a man, a doctor will take a sample of secretions from the urethra for laboratory analysis. The doctor may also order urine tests.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThe usual treatment for trichomoniasis is the antibiotic metronidazole, given by mouth in a single dose. Both partners should be treated at the same time to help ensure that the parasite is eliminated. Your doctor will ask you to avoid sexual contact until both you and your partner complete treatment and have no symptoms. Ask your doctor when you can safely resume sexual activity.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > WARNING! > **Do Not Drink Alcohol When Taking Metronidazole**]\nWhen taking metronidazole, do not drink alcohol or take nonprescription medications that contain alcohol (for example, some over-the-counter cold medications). The combination of metronidazole and alcohol can cause serious side effects such as abdominal cramping, flushing, headache, nausea, or vomiting.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment* > Genital Warts]\nGenital warts are a common and highly contagious sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). More than 5 million people are infected with HPV each year in the United States. There are more than 100 types of HPV, 30 of which can infect the genital area. Some strains of HPV can produce genital warts and cause precancerous changes in cells. Some strains of HPV have been linked to cervical cancer in women and other genital cancers in both men and women.\n\nGenital warts are spread during vaginal, anal, or oral sex and usually develop in warm, moist areas of the body, including the vagina, ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "men", "relation": "are more likely to have symptoms than", "tail": "women"}, {"head": "women", "relation": "are less likely to have symptoms than", "tail": "men"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

In the early stages of the infection, the symptoms are often mild and may go unnoticed. Frequently, women with gonorrhea have no symptoms, but some women develop symptoms about 2 to 8 days after sexual contact with an infected person or at the beginning of their next period. Possible symptoms include a mild fever, burning or pain during urination, cloudy discharge from\n\nthe vagina, discomfort or pain in the lower abdomen, or abnormal bleeding from the vagina. In some cases, a woman with gonorrhea experiences painful urination, inflammation of the bladder (cystitis; see page 877), or vaginal bleeding with sexual intercourse. If gonorrhea has led to pelvic inflammatory disease, symptoms can include abdominal cramps and pain, bleeding between periods, vomiting, or fever.\n\nMen who have gonorrhea often have no symptoms, or they may urinate more often than usual or have severe pain and burning during urination or a cloudy, pus-filled discharge from the penis.\n\nWhen gonorrhea infects the rectum, a person may experience anal itching, a cloudy discharge from the anus, and painful, bloody bowel movements. When gonorrhea infects the throat, most people have no symptoms, but some can have a sore throat.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA diagnosis of gonorrhea is based on the symptoms, a physical examination, the results of blood and urine tests, and laboratory analysis of the discharge. The doctor uses a swab to obtain a sample of discharge from the man's urethra or the woman's cervix for examination under a microscope.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nGonorrhea can be treated with antibiotics such as cefixime (taken orally) or ceftriaxone (injected directly into a muscle). Because people who have gonorrhea often also have an STD called chlamydia (see page 477), doctors usually prescribe a combination of antibiotics to treat both infections at the same time. If gonorrhea has spread through the bloodstream, a doctor will admit the person to a hospital and prescribe intravenous antibiotics.\n\nTo prevent conjunctivitis in a newborn whose mother has gonorrhea, a doctor will apply medication such as silver nitrate to the infant's eyes immediately after delivery. If untreated, gonorrhea in an infant can lead to arthritis (see page 996) or a life-threatening condition called sepsis (bacteria in the blood).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Nongonococcal Urethritis**]\nNongonococcal urethritis (NGU) is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that causes inflammation of the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body). Nongonococcal means that the infection is not caused by the type of bacteria that causes gonorrhea (see page 480). Most cases are caused by the bacterium *Chlamydia trachomatis*.\n\nNGU is usually transmitted through contact with the mucous membranes in the penis, vagina, mouth, or anus of an infected person during sexual activity. Other possible causes of NGU include urinary tract infections (see page 803), inflammation of the prostate gland (bacterial prostatitis; see page 831), narrowing of the urethra (urethral stricture; see page 837), tightening of the foreskin (phimosis; see page 839), and having a urinary catheter (a thin, flexible tube used to drain urine from the bladder).\n\nIn men, untreated NGU can lead to inflammation of the epididymis (epididymitis; see page 827), which can result in infertility (see page 494), arthritis (see page 996), conjunctivitis (see page 1038), and skin lesions. In women, untreated NGU can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (see page 871), which, in turn, can lead to ectopic pregnancy (see page 523), infertility, chronic pelvic pain, chronic inflammation of the urethra (urethritis; see page 878), inflammation of the vagina (vaginitis; see page 879), or, in a pregnant woman, miscarriage (see page 522). In both men and women, untreated NGU resulting from anal sex can cause severe inflammation of the rectum.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nOften, NGU does not produce symptoms, but an infected person can still pass the infection to his or her sex partner. In men, possible symptoms can include a discharge from the penis, pain or burning when urinating, and itching, irritation, and tenderness. In women, possible symptoms include a painful, burning sensation during urination, and a frequent need to urinate that produces only a small amount of urine. Other symptoms in women include abdominal pain, a heavy vaginal discharge, bleeding between periods, or heavy menstrual bleeding. In both men and women, an anal infection can cause rectal itching and a discharge or pain during bowel movements. An oral infection usually does not produce symptoms, but some people can have a sore throat.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nA diagnosis of NGU is based on the symptoms, a physical examination, the", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "gonorrhea", "relation": "has symptom", "tail": "mild fever"}, {"head": "gonorrhea", "relation": "has symptom", "tail": "burning or pain during urination"}, {"head": "gonorrhea", "relation": "has symptom", "tail": "cloudy discharge from the vagina"}, {"head": "gonorrhea", "relation": "has symptom", "tail": "discomfort or pain in the lower abdomen"}, {"head": "gonorrhea", "relation": "has symptom", "tail": "abnormal bleeding from the vagina"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "women with gonorrhea", "relation": "develop symptoms", "tail": "[Event: about 2 to 8 days after sexual contact]"}, {"head": "women with gonorrhea", "relation": "experience symptoms", "tail": "[Event: at the beginning of their next period]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: early stages of infection]", "relation": "lead to", "tail": "[Event: possible symptoms]"}, {"head": "[Event: gonorrhea infection]", "relation": "cause", "tail": "[Event: painful urination]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Because people who are infected with the herpes simplex virus have an increased risk of contracting other STDs, doctors may also order tests for other STDs. To confirm the diagnosis, a doctor may order blood tests to check for antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) produced by the immune system to fight the herpes virus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nThere is no cure for genital herpes, but your doctor may prescribe an antiviral drug such as acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir, which may speed healing and reduce the\n\nperiod of time during which the disease is most contagious. Your doctor will recommend that you keep the affected area clean and dry during outbreaks, avoid touching the sores, wash your hands thoroughly if you touch the sores, and avoid sexual contact from the moment symptoms begin until the last sore has fully healed. If you have another STD, the doctor will recommend treatment for that infection as well. Ask your doctor when you can safely resume sexual activity.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Syphilis]\nSyphilis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by the bacterium *Treponema pallidum*. The bacteria are transmitted by direct contact with a syphilis sore during vaginal, oral, or anal sex, and the infection spreads throughout the body in the blood and lymphatic vessels. A pregnant woman can transmit the infection to her fetus, potentially causing serious birth defects or stillbirth.\n\nPeople who have syphilis have an increased risk of becoming infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS (see page 909). Syphilis can cause CD4 cells (the infection-fighting white blood cells that are targeted by HIV) to go to the infected area to fight the infection. If HIV is present in the infected area, it will target and infect the CD4 cells, which can then spread HIV throughout the body.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nSyphilis progresses through three distinct stages, each with its own symptoms. If not treated promptly, the infection can persist for years.\n\n- **First stage** In the first stage, called primary syphilis, the disease is confined to one area of the body. From 10 days to 3 months after exposure to the bacteria (but usually within 2 to 6 weeks), a small, painless sore called a chancre develops. A chancre is usually red and solid and protrudes above the skin. The initial chancre usually appears in the genital area, such as on the penis or vulva or inside the vagina, but can also develop on the lips, tongue, cervix, rectum, or other parts of the body. Chancre on the penis are usually visible, but when they develop in a woman's vagina or cervix they are not easily detected. A chancre heals in 1 to 5 weeks, leaving a thin scar. During this stage, the bacteria circulate in the bloodstream.\n\n- **Second stage** During the second stage, called secondary syphilis, the bacteria spread and cause symptoms throughout the body. About 6 weeks after the chancre has healed, you may feel generally ill and have a sore throat, fever, and headache. You may have\n\nswollen glands in your neck, armpits, and groin, and a skin rash of small, red, scaly bumps that do not itch. You may experience patchy hair loss. Spots may appear on the palms of your hands and on the soles of your feet. Gray patches of skin, which are different from chancres, can develop in the mucous membranes of the mouth, vulva, and penis. A rash may also develop around the rectum. These skin conditions, which are highly infectious, usually heal within 2 to 6 weeks.\n\n**Third stage** For several years during the third stage, called tertiary syphilis, a person has no symptoms. Then, without warning, the disease flares up, producing a variety of symptoms depending on the part of the body that has been infected. For example, if the infection has spread to the brain and nervous system, it can cause paralysis, dementia, loss of equilibrium, loss of sensation in the legs, and, rarely, blindness. If the aorta (the main artery in the body) is infected, its walls may weaken and balloon out, forming an aneurysm (see page 599). The infection can interfere with the functioning of the aortic valve, causing inflammation of the aorta or aortic insufficiency (see page 593). During this stage, syphilis can also affect the liver, the stomach, the eyes, and other organs and tissues throughout the body.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nA diagnosis of syphilis is based on the symptoms, a physical examination, and the results of blood tests. A doctor may remove a sample of tissue from a sore for examination under a microscope, to look for the syphilis bacteria. If the doctor suspects damage to the brain and nervous system, he or she may test a sample of cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nSyphilis is easy to treat in the first stage (and ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "acyclovir", "relation": "prescribes", "tail": "genital herpes"}, {"head": "famciclovir", "relation": "prescribes", "tail": "genital herpes"}, {"head": "valacyclovir", "relation": "prescribes", "tail": "genital herpes"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "orders", "tail": "[Event: blood tests]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "orders", "tail": "[Event: laboratory tests]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "prescribes", "tail": "[Event: treatment with antiviral drug]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: diagnosis]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: treatment with antiviral drug]"}, {"head": "[Event: laboratory tests]", "relation": "confirms", "tail": "[Event: diagnosis]"}]}, "status": "success"}

These problems can be caused by or made worse by such factors as a lack of sexual knowledge and experience, inhibition, fatigue, interpersonal conflict, boredom, dissatisfaction with the appearance of your body, performance anxiety, guilt, or previous sexual abuse or assault. Sexual problems also can signal the presence of an underlying medical condition, such as diabetes. Sometimes physical problems such as an infection or inflammation can produce symptoms that prevent you from enjoying sex. Once diagnosed and treated by a doctor, these problems often disappear.\n\nThe symptoms of most sexual problems can be reversed with increased knowledge about sex and your own sexuality or simple techniques you can learn in sex therapy. The most common sexual problems in men include erection problems and premature ejaculation. In women, the most common sexual problems are the inability to achieve orgasm, lack of arousal or desire (which can also affect men), painful sex (medically known as dyspareunia), and vaginismus (involuntary spasms of the vagina). Differences in the level of sexual desire is a problem that can affect both men and women in a relationship when one partner wants to have sex more often than the other.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Erection Problems]\nAn erection problem (which doctors call erectile dysfunction) refers to the inability to achieve and maintain an erection adequate for sexual intercourse. Erection problems are the most common sexual problem seen by doctors. Most men experience erection problems at some time in their life, but for 30 million American men (about 10 percent of the entire male population and 35 percent of men over age 60), erection problems are a chronic, recurring condition. Most erection problems are treatable and, with increased awareness of the problem, more men are seeking and responding to treatment.\n\nMost erection problems are caused by physical factors. The ability to achieve and maintain an adequate erection depends on a combination of healthy nerves, blood vessels, muscles, and fibrous tissues, as well as on adequate levels of hormones such as testosterone. Damage, injury, or malfunction in any of these areas can interfere with the ability to achieve or maintain an erection.\n\nInflammation or infection of the prostate gland or bladder can make urination, erection, or ejaculation painful and difficult. In uncircumcised men, neglecting to clean under the foreskin increases the risk of an infection. The foreskin can become so tight over the swollen tip of the inflamed penis that it cannot be drawn back (phimosis; see page 839). Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs; see page 477) such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, or herpes also can affect a man's ability to have an erection.\n\nMedical conditions that damage nerves and blood vessels—such as diabetes (see page 889), heart disease (see page 558), brain or spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis (see page 696), or Parkinson's disease (see page 691)—can cause erection problems. In some cases, prescription medications—such as drugs used to treat high blood pressure and heart disease, and drugs that affect the nervous system such as antidepressants, tranquilizers, and sedatives—contribute to erection problems. Cigarette smoking, over-the-counter medications, alcohol, or illicit drugs such as marijuana, heroin, and cocaine also can play a role. Peyronie's disease (see page 839), a condition in which scarring of the penile tissues produces a curvature of the penis and pain during an erection, is another possible cause. Smoking adversely affects blood flow and can affect a man's ability to have an erection.\n\nIn some men, psychological factors such as anger, stress, anxiety, or depression can contribute to erection problems. Being unable to maintain an erection can make a man feel inadequate, embarrassed, or guilty, and consider himself unattractive to his partner. These feelings may cause him to avoid intimate situations or withdraw from his partner,\n\nwhich can increase tension in the relationship. The psychological effects of erection problems can also affect other areas of his life, such as social interactions and job performance.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nMen who have erection problems may be unable to achieve an erection, may be able to achieve an erection only occasionally, or may be unable to maintain an erection. If you have symptoms of erection problems, your doctor may refer you to a urologist (a doctor who specializes in treating disorders of the urinary tract).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis*]\nTo help diagnose erection problems, a doctor will take a detailed health history and a sexual history. He or she will ask about your ability to achieve and maintain erections and ask you when and how often they occur.

The drug relaxes the smooth muscle and widens the main artery that supplies blood to the penis, increasing blood flow to the penis. The injections are relatively painless and produce an erection that begins about 5 to 15 minutes after the injection and lasts from 30 minutes to 2 hours. No foreplay is needed to produce an erection.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Q & A > Medications for Erection Problems]\n**Q. Can sildenafil or another medication improve my sex life?**\n\n**A. Yes and no.** These drugs are prescription medications used for treating the inability to achieve and maintain an erection adequate for sexual intercourse. If you can achieve an erection through sexual stimulation but cannot maintain it, these drugs can help you. Keep in mind, however, that they are not aphrodisiacs, do not arouse or increase sexual desire, and are not substitutes for working on a relationship. Nor do they improve or prolong erections in men who have normal erections.\n\n**Q. How do I obtain one of these drugs?**\n\n**A. These medications are available only by prescription.** See your doctor if you have an erection problem. The doctor will give you a thorough examination to diagnose your sexual problem to determine if medication would be helpful. Some Web sites offer prescriptions for these drugs without obtaining sufficient medical information from the person.\n\n**Q. I have heart disease and, several months ago, my doctor prescribed nitroglycerin for my chest pain. I use it every day to prevent chest pain. Lately I've been having some problems getting erections. I've heard that medication could help with this problem. Should I ask my doctor for a prescription?**\n\n**A. No.** You cannot safely use sildenafil, vardenafil, or tadalafil for your erection problem if you are taking heart medications such as nitroglycerin or alpha blockers. The combination can cause dangerously low blood pressure. Make sure your doctor knows about all medications you are taking.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Q & A > Urethral suppositories]\nUrethral suppositories are sometimes recommended for treating erection problems. A urethral suppository is a single-use applicator filled with the drug alprostadil, a vasodilator that causes an erection by relaxing the smooth muscle of the penis and widening the main artery that supplies blood to the penis. To use a urethral suppository, insert the applicator about an inch into the urethral opening of the penis. The drug is\n\nreleased, absorbed by the urethra, and transported to the surrounding tissues. An erection begins within 8 to 10 minutes and may last as long as 30 to 60 minutes.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Q & A > Vacuum devices]\nVacuum devices produce erections by pulling blood into the penis and trapping it. You insert your penis into a hollow plastic tube that is closed at one end and press the tube against your body to form a seal. A vacuum is created in the tube with a small hand-or battery-driven pump, drawing blood into the penis and causing the penis to engorge, enlarge, and become rigid. After 1 to 3 minutes in the vacuum, an adequate erection develops and you place a soft rubber O-ring around the base of the penis to trap blood and maintain the erection until you remove the O-ring after sex. The O-ring should be left in place for no more than 30 minutes, or the blood supply to the penis could be blocked.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Q & A > Penile implants]\nAn implantable penile prosthesis (artificial device) is another treatment option for erection problems. All penile implants place prosthetic tubes inside the penis to produce engorgement similar to that of a natural erection. Most implants are inflatable and are flaccid when not in use. These devices are very effective for treating all types of erection problems but, because they are mechanical, they can occasionally malfunction.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Q & A > Penile implant]\nThe inflatable penile implant is a device that is surgically implanted in the penis, scrotum, and lower abdomen. The implant contains cylinders that fill with fluid in the penis to mimic the natural engorgement process that occurs during an erection. The cylinders are attached to a pump that is activated by squeezing the scrotum.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the mechanism of an inflatable penile implant. The left side shows the implant components: a liquid-filled pouch implanted under abdominal muscles, and a pump inside the scrotum.

He or she will perform a physical examination and will probably order a variety of tests to rule out a physical cause of your problem.\n\nTreatment of an inability to achieve orgasm depends on the underlying cause. If your doctor cannot identify an underlying physical condition, he or she may be able to suggest ways to help you achieve orgasm or may refer you to a sex therapist for treatment. Sex therapy usually requires both partners to participate in therapy sessions and perform recommended exercises at home.\n\nThe most successful treatment prescribed by sex therapists for anorgasmia is sexual self-exploration through masturbation, combined with sexual fantasy. Masturbation is a normal, healthy activity that can help a woman learn how to become aroused and find the kind of sexual stimulation she needs to reach orgasm. Then she can use self-stimulation to reach orgasm when she is with her partner, showing her partner the techniques that work best.\n\nSometimes trying a new position during intercourse can help. If your partner is willing, experiment with some new positions. Many women find it easier to attain orgasm when they are on top, astride their partner. In this position, a woman can control the intensity and exact location of her clitoral and vaginal stimulation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment* > **Painful Intercourse**]\nPain during sexual intercourse, also called dyspareunia, can affect both men and women and is usually caused by a physical condition. In women, causes of frictional pain at the vaginal opening include inadequate vaginal lubrication, a vaginal or bladder infection, a sexually transmitted disease (STD) such as genital herpes (see page 482), or soreness after childbirth. Deep pelvic pain can result from conditions such as endometriosis (see page 870), a disorder of the ovaries, or allergic reactions. Chronic pain in the lower back also can cause deep pelvic pain during intercourse.\n\nCommon causes of painful intercourse in men include a tight foreskin, an STD, infection of the prostate gland or bladder, an anatomical abnormality of the penis, or inflammation. Cancer of the penis or testicles and musculoskeletal conditions such as arthritis in the lower back also make thrusting uncomfortable. Some spermicides (see page 471) can cause a burning sensation in both men and women.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment* > *Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment*]\nIn women, symptoms of dyspareunia include pain or discomfort in the external part of the genitals or deep inside the pelvic area. Men usually experience pain in the penis.\n\nYour doctor will be able to find the cause of your discomfort by performing a physical examination of your reproductive organs and ordering tests to detect an infection or an underlying medical condition. Treatment of dyspareunia depends on the underlying cause.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Lack of Interest in Sex]\nA lack of interest in sex is the second most common sexual problem (after erection problems) and affects both men and women. The problem can involve both a lack of desire for one's partner and the inability to become sexually aroused during sexual activity. Fatigue and stress are common causes of lack of interest in sex. Physical causes include a hormonal imbalance, infection, anemia, genital pain, or a long-term illness such as cancer or heart disease. Disinterest in sex sometimes masks another sexual problem, such as premature ejaculation (see previous page) or a woman's inability to have an orgasm (see previous page). After the birth of a baby, some women feel a lack of desire for sex. Pain and bleeding from a recent delivery, sleep deprivation, postpartum depression (see page 540), and fear of another pregnancy can contribute to a decreased desire for sexual activity at this time. Other causes of decreased desire in both men and women include:\n\n- Anxiety after a traumatic life event, such as death of a family member, financial problems, or losing a job\n- Anger\n- Depression\n- A traumatic sexual experience in childhood\n- Use of alcohol or other drugs such as narcotics or tranquilizers\n\nThe male sex hormone testosterone stimulates the male sex drive. If your testosterone levels are low, your sexual interest and capacity for arousal are also likely to be low. The condition underlying a drop in testosterone level may be physical, such as liver, kidney, or pituitary disease, or it may be a side effect of a drug you are taking. Other sexual disorders, such as erection problems (see page 486), can interfere with the enjoyment of intercourse and cause a man to lose interest in sex or avoid sex.\n\nIn some cases, poor communication causes a woman to receive less than adequate sexual stimulation from her partner.

This condition prevents intercourse because the muscles around the opening of the vagina tighten so much that the penis cannot penetrate. Women who have vaginismus may not even be able to insert a tampon into their vagina. The inability to reach orgasm (see page 489) often accompanies this disorder.\n\nVaginismus is an exaggeration of a natural protective vaginal reflex, similar to the action of closing your eyes in a dust storm. The most common causes of vaginismus are emotional factors such as shame, guilt, or anxiety over a possible pregnancy, or the anticipation of painful intercourse. Inadequate education or misinformation about sexuality can produce fear that results in the disorder.\n\nTemporary vaginismus sometimes occurs when a woman has a physical problem that affects the genitals, such as an abscess or severe inflammation of the vagina. Any traumatic sexual experience, such as rape or sexual abuse, can cause temporary or permanent vaginismus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nYour doctor can diagnose vaginismus from your description of the symptoms and an examination of your genital area. If the doctor suspects a physical cause, he or she will order any tests necessary to diagnose it. If no physical cause is detected, the doctor probably will refer you to a sex therapist for treatment. The therapist will work with you to find the underlying cause of the problem and help you overcome it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Infertility]\nInfertility is a medical condition that impairs a person's ability to have children. Doctors diagnose infertility when a couple has failed to achieve a pregnancy after having unprotected intercourse for several months. Doctors also consider women infertile who have become pregnant but have not been able to have a live birth because of repeated miscarriages or stillbirths. Infertility affects more than 6 million people nationwide, occurring in both men and women.\n\nCoping with infertility can be a difficult, life-changing process that produces strong feelings of loss and disappointment. Both women and men may feel helpless, angry, or guilty; men may feel that it diminishes their masculinity and women their femininity. Couples who undergo treatment for infertility often experience hope followed by disappointment.\n\nDiagnostic techniques, innovative drugs, and surgical procedures are available to help many infertile couples. Most cases of infertility are treated with medication or surgery. However, about 5 percent of cases require more sophisticated assisted reproductive techniques, such as in vitro fertilization.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Causes of Infertility]\nInfertility is a problem usually experienced as a couple. There are many causes of infertility, and a couple can have more than one medical condition that affects their fertility. About 40 to 50 percent of cases of infertility result from a difficulty with the woman's reproductive system and about 30 to 40 percent from a difficulty with the man's. In approximately 10 to 30 percent of couples, infertility results from either factors related to both the man and the woman or is considered unexplained. Many causes of infertility are reversible with treatment, but some are not. If the cause of infertility cannot be corrected, techniques exist that can bypass it and result in a pregnancy. However, there are no guarantees of success from infertility treatment and, in spite of repeated attempts, some couples never conceive.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Causes of Infertility in Women*]\nThe causes of infertility in women are numerous and range from a deficiency of eggs, to infection that causes obstructive scarring in the reproductive system, to medical conditions such as diabetes or thyroid disorders that alter metabolism. The most common causes of infertility in women are:\n\n- **Lack of ovulation** Failure to ovulate (release an egg from the ovary during the menstrual cycle) is usually caused by a hormonal imbalance.\n- **Polycystic ovarian syndrome** Polycystic ovarian syndrome (see page 865), a metabolic disorder characterized by abnormal hormone levels, affects up to 10 percent of all women. An imbalance of the ovulation-stimulating hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) blocks ovulation.\n- **Infection** Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs; see page 477) or peritonitis (inflammation of the membrane lining the wall of the abdominal cavity) can cause scarring and blockage of the fallopian tubes.\n- **Endometriosis** The growth of uterine tissue in the pelvis can either block an egg's passage from the ovary through a fallopian tube or form ovarian cysts.\n- **Pelvic surgery** Surgery in the pelvic area can result in adhesions (bands of fibrous scar tissue) that obstruct or misshape a woman's reproductive organs, preventing an egg from reaching a fallopian t", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "vaginismus", "relation": "is caused by", "tail": "emotional factors"}, {"head": "vaginismus", "relation": "is an exaggeration of", "tail": "natural protective vaginal reflex"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

If you are trying to conceive, keep the following in mind:\n\n- **Delayed childbearing** A woman's fertility starts to decline after about age 30. Advancing maternal age coupled with a medical cause of infertility significantly increases a woman's risk of infertility.\n- **Smoking** Cigarette smoking decreases the amount of estrogen a woman's ovaries produce for ovulation and increases the risk of genetic abnormalities in her eggs. Smoking also increases the risk of miscarriage and can bring on early menopause. In men, smoking seems to increase the production of abnormally shaped or genetically altered sperm.\n- **Weight problems** Overweight women produce excessive amounts of estrogen and underweight women produce too little estrogen, both of which can disrupt ovulation. Obese women have an increased risk of miscarriage,\n\nwhich can result from a hormonal imbalance. Obese men can become infertile when layers of fat increase the temperature around the testicles, producing a low sperm count.\n\n- **Alcohol consumption** Having even one alcoholic drink per week can lower a woman's chances of conceiving by about 7 percent. Excessive drinking (consuming more than two drinks a day) lowers a man's sperm count. The more you drink, the lower your chances of conceiving.\n\n- **Sexually transmitted diseases** STDs such as chlamydia can cause scarring of the fallopian tubes, blocking them and preventing eggs from traveling to the uterus.\n\n- **Caffeine** Consuming more than two caffeine-containing beverages per day may decrease fertility.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Lifestyle Factors That Affect Fertility > Age and success rates for assisted reproductive technologies]\nA woman's age has the biggest influence on the success of an assisted reproductive technology using the woman's own eggs. The success rates are defined by pregnancies and live births. The success rates are highest for women in their 20s and start to decline after about age 30, reflecting the normal gradual decline in a woman's fertility with age. The chart above is based on 1999 figures from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n![Line graph showing the success rates of assisted reproductive technology (ART) for women aged 24 to 46. The Y-axis represents 'Pregnancies and Live Births (%)' (0 to 50). The X-axis represents 'Women's Age' (24 to 46). The graph compares the 'Pregnancy rate' (black line with squares) and the 'Live birth rate' (gray line with circles). Both rates peak around age 28-30, with the pregnancy rate slightly higher than the live birth rate. Both rates decline sharply after age 30, with the pregnancy rate dropping to near zero by age 46, while the live birth rate remains significantly above zero.]()![](_page_897_Figure_6.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosing Infertility]\nDuring the time you are trying to conceive, keep track of the length of your menstrual cycles for a few months and use a home ovulation-predictor kit to predict when you ovulate. Recording this information in a log will help you determine the best time to have intercourse, and the information can help your doctor later if you seek help trying to conceive. In the past, many doctors told their patients to try to conceive for 12 months before seeking medical help, but because many women are waiting until they are older to have a baby, this may be too long.\n\nIf you have not conceived after 6 months of trying, you and your partner should see your doctor, especially if you are over age 30, have a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID; see page 871), or have irregular periods. Your doctor will take a complete medical history from both you and your partner, including asking questions about the frequency and timing of your sexual intercourse. He or she may order some initial infertility tests. Depending on the findings of these tests, your doctor may then refer you to a reproductive endocrinologist (a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating fertility problems).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diagnosing Infertility > *Infertility Testing in Women*]\nInfertility testing is usually much more extensive for women than for men. The initial tests will determine if you are ovulating and can evaluate the quality of your eggs. At your first appointment with the infertility specialist, he or she can test your baseline levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estrogen. FSH stimulates the growth of follicles (fluid-filled sacs that contain the developing eggs) in the ovaries. If you have an ovulation problem, measuring the level of luteinizing hormone (LH) also can be helpful. LH stimulates the follicles to release an egg and causes the lining of the uterus to thicken in preparation for", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "smoking", "relation": "decreases", "tail": "estrogen"}, {"head": "smoking", "relation": "increases", "tail": "risk of genetic abnormalities"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

He or she will ask about your current health and lifestyle to determine if excessive smoking, drinking, or other drug use could be affecting your sperm. The doctor will then perform a thorough physical examination, including an examination of the hair growth in your genital area to determine if you are producing a sufficient amount of testosterone, and an examination of your penis, scrotum, and prostate (to look for abnormalities).\n\nThe semen analysis is the most important test for male fertility. The doctor will ask for at least one semen sample, obtained by masturbation. Before producing a sample, you will have to wait at least 48 hours (but not more than 5 days) after your last ejaculation. Among the factors the doctor will consider when evaluating your semen sample are the appearance and consistency of the semen, the total sperm count, the shape and structure of the sperm, and the motility (movement) and speed of the sperm. If any of these factors fall outside the normal range, the doctor will probably order a second sperm analysis for confirmation and a hormone evaluation to screen for more specific abnormalities.\n\nIn a small number of couples with otherwise unexplained infertility, doctors sometimes order specialized tests, such as a sperm penetration assay, which measures the sperm's ability to penetrate an egg by pairing the sperm with the egg from a hamster using *in vitro* fertilization (see page 500). Infertile men who have very low or absent sperm counts may undergo genetic testing to determine if they have a chromosome abnormality (see page 955). The results of the initial tests determine what other tests you will need.\n\nIf the results of your semen analysis are abnormal, the infertility specialist will probably refer you to a urologist (a doctor who specializes in treating disorders of the male urinary and reproductive system) who is trained in male infertility for a more extensive evaluation.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Infertility Testing in Men* > **How to Choose an Infertility Treatment Center**]\nSelecting an infertility treatment center can be confusing because different centers provide different services and produce varying success rates. When\n\nyou are searching for infertility treatment, ask whether the centers you have selected offer the following basic services:\n\n- **Seven-day availability** The center's staff and services should be available every day of the week, on weekends, and on holidays so you can call with information about your menstrual cycle and find out your test results quickly.\n- **Psychological support** The center should have mental health professionals available to provide support during this difficult time.\n- **On-site laboratory** The clinic should be able to perform semen analysis, postcoital tests, and blood and hormone tests on site to save critical time. The laboratory should be fully certified.\n- **Ultrasound equipment** Transvaginal ultrasound monitoring, in which an ultrasound scan of your ovaries is performed through the vagina, helps to determine if the prescribed medication is stimulating ovulation and if your ovaries are releasing eggs.\n\nAsk whether the doctors who will be caring for you are board-certified in reproductive endocrinology, how many live births have occurred in their program, and what the costs will be. Insurance coverage for infertility treatment varies by state and type of health insurance. Check with your employer to find out exactly what kind of coverage you have.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects and reports the success rates of all assisted reproductive technology programs in the country that belong to the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies. You can access this information on the Internet at <http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphe/drh/art.htm>. To obtain a printed copy, call the CDC's division of reproductive health at 770-488-5372.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Infertility Testing in Men* > *Unexplained Infertility*]\nAbout 10 to 30 percent of all infertile couples are told that their infertility cannot be explained. Doctors reach a diagnosis of unexplained infertility after ruling out other possible causes through a standard battery of tests. The diagnosis does not mean that no cause for the infertility exists, but rather that the cause cannot be identified using the initial screening tests.\n\nAfter 1 to 3 years of unexplained infertility, many couples conceive on their own. The age of the woman is usually the key in this process. Spontaneous conception is much more likely in a woman under age 35 than in a woman who is over 40.

For example, if your sperm count has been lowered by an infection or a medical condition, your doctor will provide appropriate treatment. The doctor also will strongly recommend that you discontinue any activities—including excessive smoking, drinking, or other drug use—that might be contributing to your infertility. In general, a healthy lifestyle promotes good sperm production.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Tubal cannulation > *Treating Infertility in Men* > **Surgery**]\nIf infertility is the result of a blockage in the vas deferens (one of the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the urethra), surgeons can sometimes open the blockage. Doctors can correct a varicose vein in a testicle (varicocele; see page 829), which can lower sperm production, by performing surgery to tie off the affected vein.\n\nAn outpatient procedure called percutaneous embolization is as effective as traditional surgery in correcting a varicocele without the need for general anesthesia and has fewer complications. During percutaneous embolization, the surgeon inserts a small tube into a vein in the groin area through a tiny incision. He or she then injects a dye into the vein and, guided by X-ray imaging, inserts tiny metal coils or a balloon into the vein to block the flow of blood, which shrinks the varicose vein. Recovery takes less than 24 hours. Treating a varicocele improves sperm production and increases the chances of conception.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Tubal cannulation > *Treating Infertility in Men* > **Medications**]\nA low sperm count or poor sperm motility (movement) can sometimes result if a man's testicles are not being stimulated enough naturally by the hormones FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone). In this case, a doctor may recommend taking the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) for several months to improve sperm production and motility.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Tubal cannulation > *Assisted Reproductive Technologies*]\nIf treatment with medication or surgery has not helped you and your partner conceive, you may want to consider additional infertility techniques known collectively as assisted reproductive technologies. These techniques use high-tech methods to fertilize an egg and transfer it to a woman's uterus. This technology, which has helped many couples achieve a pregnancy, has improved steadily over the past several years, and the success rate may soon be approaching 50 percent for each attempt.\n\nAssisted reproductive techniques such as in vitro fertilization (see right) are the most stressful of all infertility treatments. The woman must give herself frequent injections of drugs and have blood tests and ultrasound scans regularly. Both partners usually approach each attempt with hope and can be disappointed if the procedure fails. Feelings of depression, frustration, and hopelessness are common after a failed in vitro fertilization. Then the process starts over again the next month, and may be repeated several times. Before undergoing assisted reproductive techniques, educate yourself about them thoroughly, ask for support from your family and friends, and take good care of yourself by getting enough rest and exercise and by eating well. It can be helpful to talk to a mental health professional who has been recommended by your infertility clinic.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Tubal cannulation > *Assisted Reproductive Technologies* > **Intrauterine insemination**]\nIn intrauterine insemination, often called artificial insemination, a doctor uses a thin tube (catheter) and syringe to introduce sperm from the woman's partner (or from a donor) directly into the uterus, close to the time of ovulation. Intrauterine insemination is designed to make it easier for sperm to reach the fallopian tubes to fertilize an egg. It is used when the man's sperm count is only marginally low or when the woman's cervical mucus prevents sperm from entering the uterus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Tubal cannulation > **Donor Sperm**]\nCouples sometimes choose to use donated sperm if the man cannot produce enough normal sperm to fertilize his partner'", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "Tubal cannulation", "relation": "treats", "tail": "blocked fallopian tube"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "wire", "relation": "threaded through", "tail": "[Event: procedure to open a blocked fallopian tube]"}, {"head": "hysteroscope", "relation": "inserted through", "tail": "[Event: procedure to open a blocked fallopian tube]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

An increasing number of couples are choosing to donate their embryos to another infertile couple. Embryo donation is an option for the same reasons as egg donation. In addition, it may be used by single women whose own eggs would not otherwise be used or by couples in which both the male and female are infertile and who choose not to (or cannot afford to) undergo a complete cycle of IVF.\n\nThe process is similar to the final step of IVF, in which embryos are introduced into the woman's uterus to produce a pregnancy. Before undergoing the procedure, the woman who is receiving the donated embryos will have a thorough physical examination and tests to make sure that a pregnancy would not compromise her health. She will be given hormones, including estrogen and progesterone, to prepare the lining of her uterus to accept an embryo. In some cases, the timing of implantation is based on the woman's own menstrual cycle. When the uterus is ready, the frozen embryos are thawed and transferred to the uterus. If pregnancy results, the woman continues to take the estrogen and progesterone for 8 weeks.\n\nIf you are considering embryo donation (either as a donor or as a recipient), talk to a mental health professional and a lawyer about the ethical and legal issues concerning the procedure. For example, you will need to consider issues such as disclosure—whether the donor wants to be named, whether you want the donor to know you, and what you will tell your prospective child.

In these cases, some infertile couples ask another woman to serve as a gestational carrier—also known as a surrogate mother. This agreement is a legal contract in which the woman consents to have a fertilized egg from the couple implanted into her uterus and to carry the pregnancy to term. The woman further agrees to turn the baby over to the couple upon delivery.\n\nHaving a baby with a gestational carrier has a number of medical and legal consequences, so be sure to discuss the topic thoroughly with both your doctor and an attorney before going ahead with it.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pregnancy and Childbirth]\nA healthy pregnancy starts before a woman gets pregnant. If you are planning to get pregnant, make an appointment with your doctor. He or she will perform a thorough examination to evaluate your health and determine if you have any medical conditions or inherited disorders that could complicate a pregnancy or make it inadvisable for you to get pregnant. In addition, if you have a chronic disorder—such as a heart disorder (see page 520), epilepsy (see page 686), diabetes (see page 889), kidney disease, or an autoimmune disease such as lupus (see page 920) or rheumatoid arthritis (see page 918)—your condition must be carefully monitored throughout your pregnancy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pregnancy and Childbirth > Pregnancy]\nThe healthier you are during your pregnancy, the more likely your child will be born healthy. If you are trying to become pregnant, take steps now to help ensure a healthy pregnancy. Stop smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol, avoid potentially harmful drugs or chemicals, eat healthfully (lots of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes), and exercise regularly. Taking 400 micrograms (0.4 milligram) of folic acid every day in a supplement will reduce your risk of having a child with abnormal development of the spine or brain (neural tube defect; see page 398). Depending on your health history, higher doses of folic acid may be recommended.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Pregnancy and Childbirth > Conception]\nConception begins with the fertilization of one of a woman's eggs. Fertilization can occur shortly after a mature egg is released from an ovary, which usually occurs about halfway through the menstrual cycle. If a woman has sexual intercourse during this time,\n\nshe can get pregnant as sperm ejaculated from her male partner travel through her vagina and uterus up to the fallopian tubes. Fertilization occurs if a sperm penetrates the cell wall of an egg inside one of the fallopian tubes. The fertilized egg reaches the uterus 2 to 7 days later and embeds itself in the lining of the uterus, at about the time a woman's period is due. By the time most women suspect they may be pregnant, the egg has become an embryo that is developing inside the uterus.\n\nA full-term pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks from the time of conception to delivery. Although conception usually occurs halfway through a woman's menstrual cycle, the delivery date is calculated from the first day of her last period because the exact day the egg is fertilized is difficult to know.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Confirming a Pregnancy]\nIf you have missed a menstrual period and want to know if you are pregnant, you can use a home pregnancy test. Home pregnancy tests work by detecting the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), which is present in the urine of a pregnant woman about 2 weeks after her first missed period. The results are most accurate when you follow the manufacturer's instructions exactly and test your urine first thing in the morning before you drink anything. The results of a home pregnancy test may not be reliable if you are taking antidepressants (see page 712), are approaching menopause, or have irregular or infrequent periods. Also, a negative result (indicating you are not pregnant) is less reliable than a positive result (indicating you are pregnant). You should see your doctor if you have a negative result on a home test but still suspect that you are pregnant. Your doctor, a family planning clinic, or your local health department can perform a more accurate pregnancy test.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Eggs, sperm, and fertilization]\nA woman's ovaries, one on each side of her uterus, contain thousands of immature eggs, with which she was born. After puberty, one of the eggs matures each month in one of the ovaries and, about halfway through the menstrual cycle, it is released into the adjacent fallopian tube. In males, sperm are produced continuously inside the testicles and are stored in the seminal vesicles until ejaculation.\n\nFertilization of an egg by a sperm takes place in one of the fallopian tubes shortly after the egg is released into the fallopian ", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "hysterectomy", "relation": "causes", "tail": "infertility"}, {"head": "multiple miscarriages", "relation": "causes", "tail": "infertility"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "woman", "relation": "consents to have a fertilized egg implanted", "tail": "[Event: implantation]"}, {"head": "woman", "relation": "carries the pregnancy to term", "tail": "[Event: gestational carrier]"}, {"head": "woman", "relation": "turns the baby over to the couple upon delivery", "tail": "[Event: delivery]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: implantation]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: gestational carrier]"}, {"head": "[Event: gestational carrier]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: delivery]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Besides regular checkups with your doctor to monitor the progress of your pregnancy and to receive information about how to have a healthy pregnancy, prenatal care may involve tests to detect genetic diseases or birth defects in the fetus such as congenital heart disease (see page 389), neural tube defects (see page 398), or chromosome abnormalities such as Down syndrome (see page 955). A woman and her partner may also want to sign up for childbirth preparation classes to prepare themselves for labor and delivery.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Prenatal Care > Regular Prenatal Checkups]\nOnce your pregnancy has been confirmed, your doctor may refer you to an obstetrician (a doctor who specializes in the care of a woman during pregnancy, labor, delivery, and the period immediately after delivery), or schedule you for subsequent checkups and tests. Prenatal checkups are usually scheduled monthly until the third trimester, when they are scheduled more frequently.\n\nPrenatal care helps prevent complications of pregnancy and childbirth and provides both the pregnant woman and the fetus with any necessary medical care before birth. Because fetal development is affected by environmental factors inside the uterus and by the woman's state of health (especially during the crucial first 3 months), a woman's doctor may make some lifestyle recommendations. For example, doctors usually recommend that pregnant women not smoke cigarettes (smoking increases the risk of having a baby with a low birth weight or of having a preterm delivery) and avoid alcohol because it can cause a number of serious problems in the fetus, including mental retardation (fetal alcohol syndrome; see page 409). Also avoid taking any unnecessary drugs or exposing yourself to radiation or environmental substances such as lead, mercury, pesticides, or solvents, which can cause complications during pregnancy and delivery. Stay away from saunas, steam baths, hot tubs, and extremely hot baths, which can raise your body temperature to a level that could be harmful to the fetus.\n\nAt your first visit, your doctor will perform a physical examination (including measuring your blood pressure and weight) and establish your due date (which usually is set 40 weeks from the first day of your last menstrual period, but may be adjusted based on the size of the fetus shown on an ultrasound or the size of your uterus felt on a pelvic examination). The doctor will examine your cervix to make sure it can support a\n\npregnancy. He or she will take your medical history and ask if there is a possibility that you could have a sexually transmitted disease (all pregnant women are tested for gonorrhea and syphilis).\n\nAt your initial visit or during subsequent visits, you will have blood tests for blood type (see page 145), Rh factor (see next page), and anemia (see page 610); for infections (see next page) such as rubella, hepatitis B (see page 786), and toxoplasmosis; and for excess levels of protein (which can indicate preeclampsia; see page 526) and glucose (a sign of gestational diabetes; see page 521).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Smoking and Pregnancy]\nSmoking is especially harmful during pregnancy. Seriously consider quitting if you are pregnant because:\n\n- Smoking increases your risk of having an ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage.\n- Smoking doubles your risk of having serious pregnancy complications involving the placenta.\n- Smoking makes you twice as likely as a nonsmoking woman to have a baby with a low birth weight, and more likely to have a preterm delivery.\n- Smoking may increase your baby's risk of having birth defects such as clubfoot, cleft lip, or cleft palate.\n- Smoking triples your baby's risk of dying of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) compared with children of mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy.\n- Smoking increases your child's risk of having an attention deficit disorder or learning disability.\n\nAsk your doctor about a quit-smoking strategy (see page 29) that would be safe and effective for you.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Infectious Diseases and Pregnancy*]\nSome infections that a woman develops during pregnancy can cause birth defects or can be fatal to the fetus.

Some of the tests, such as amniocentesis, can determine if a fetus has a genetic abnormality or a malformation. Other tests, such as ultrasound, can evaluate the development of the fetus, detect any structural abnormalities, and date the pregnancy. For various reasons, pregnant women may choose not to have the tests. For example, some women would never consider terminating a pregnancy even if a severe or lethal defect were found in the fetus. During your pregnancy, discuss your feelings with your doctor, who can help you evaluate the benefits and risks of having the tests.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Prenatal Testing > *Ultrasound*]\nUltrasound (see page 111) is an imaging procedure that uses sound waves to produce pictures of the developing fetus on a monitor. Ultrasound does not involve radiation or X-rays and is harmless, painless, and noninvasive. Ultrasound is offered to most women at least once during their pregnancy and more frequently to women who may be at risk of having problems. During the first trimester, ultrasound is often used to confirm and date a pregnancy by determining the size and shape of the fetus. Many doctors recommend an ultrasound between the 17th and 19th weeks of pregnancy to evaluate fetal growth and development and to rule out some structural abnormalities such as neural tube defects (see page 398) or cleft lip or cleft palate (see page 403). Ultrasound can also detect twins and, after the 16th week, can sometimes determine a fetus's gender. During late pregnancy, ultrasound may be used to evaluate the health, size, and position of the fetus and the placenta in preparation for delivery.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Prenatal Testing > Rh Disease in Pregnancy]\nWhen a woman with Rh-negative blood has a fetus with Rh-positive blood, some of the fetus's blood may enter the woman's bloodstream at birth, or during pregnancy. If the woman is not given Rh immunoglobulin within 72 hours of delivery, her immune system will develop antibodies to fight the Rh-\n\npositive blood, which it recognizes as foreign. These antibodies don't cause problems in a first Rh-incompatible pregnancy, but if the woman does not receive the Rh immunoglobulin and has a subsequent Rh-positive fetus, her antibodies could cross the placenta and destroy the fetus's red blood cells, possibly causing anemia or even death. After a miscarriage or the termination of a pregnancy, Rh immunoglobulin should always be administered to an Rh-negative woman.\n\nKey\n\n- Rh-negative blood\n- Rh-positive blood\n- Antibody\n\nDiagram illustrating the progression of Rh incompatibility:\n\n1.

The sound waves are electronically translated into an image on a computer screen.\n\n![Diagram illustrating a vaginal ultrasound procedure. A transducer is inserted into the vagina, and the resulting image of the fetus is displayed on a monitor.]()![](_page_924_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Vaginal ultrasound]\nIn a vaginal ultrasound, a narrow transducer (called a vaginal wand) is inserted into the vagina to produce images on a monitor. Vaginal ultrasounds may be used in the first trimester of pregnancy for a number of reasons, such as to see a fetus more clearly or to confirm (or rule out) a pregnancy or an abnormality such as an elongated cervix (which can indicate an impending miscarriage) or an ectopic pregnancy.\n\n![Diagram illustrating a vaginal ultrasound procedure. A transducer (Vaginal wand) is inserted into the vagina, and the resulting image of the fetus is displayed on a monitor. Labels include Vagina, Cervix, and Vaginal wand.]()![](_page_924_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *AFP and Triple Screen Blood Tests*]\nAll women are offered one of two blood tests between the 15th and 20th weeks of pregnancy to measure the level of alpha-fetoprotein (more familiarly known simply as AFP), a protein produced by the developing fetus. AFP is present in amniotic fluid and, in smaller amounts, in a pregnant woman's blood. One test measures just AFP. The triple screen blood test measures AFP and two hormones, human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and estriol (a form of estrogen), which are produced by the\n\nplacenta during pregnancy. The interpretation of these measurements is based on factors such as a woman's age, race, and weight.\n\nThese blood tests help evaluate the risk that the f", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "fetus", "relation": "has", "tail": "genetic abnormality"}, {"head": "fetus", "relation": "has", "tail": "malformation"}, {"head": "fetus", "relation": "develops", "tail": "abnormalities"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "helps", "tail": "[Event: evaluate benefits and risks]"}, {"head": "woman", "relation": "discusses", "tail": "[Event: feelings with doctor]"}, {"head": "pregnant woman", "relation": "chooses", "tail": "[Event: not to have tests]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: severe or lethal defect found]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: termination of pregnancy]"}, {"head": "[Event: structural abnormalities detected]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: treatment needed]"}]}, "status": "success"}

With early diagnosis and careful control of blood glucose during pregnancy, gestational diabetes seldom causes problems for either the pregnant woman or the fetus. Untreated, however, the condition can cause the fetus to be larger than normal (resulting in a more complicated delivery) or to have a low glucose level and chemical imbalances after delivery.\n\nDuring glucose screening, you are given a glucose solution to drink, and a blood sample is taken 1 hour later. If the test shows that your glucose level is elevated, you will have another, more accurate test called the glucose tolerance test (see page 895) to make a diagnosis.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Group B Strept* Test]\nMost pregnant women are screened for group B streptococcal bacteria that live in the reproductive and urinary systems and seldom cause symptoms. However, during pregnancy, the bacteria can cause infections in the woman's urinary tract and uterus, which, if transmitted to the baby during delivery, can cause serious complications such as pneumonia, blood infection, or inflammation of the membranes covering the brain (meningitis; see page 692). For the group B strep test, the doctor uses a swab to take a sample from the woman's vagina and rectum. The sample is sent to the laboratory, and the cells are grown and tested for the presence of the bacteria. Test results are available within 24 to 48 hours. If you are found to carry the bacteria, you will be given antibiotics intravenously (through a vein) during labor and delivery to prevent your baby from being infected. Although one out of three pregnant women carries the bacteria, only 1 out of 200 babies actually develops an infection. The infection can usually be treated effectively by giving the baby intravenous antibiotics for about 10 days after delivery.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Fetal Monitoring*]\nThroughout pregnancy and labor, doctors can evaluate the health of the fetus by measuring the fetal heart rate. Fetal monitoring is most frequently used during labor to make sure the fetus is getting enough oxygen and to evaluate how the fetus is reacting to the stress of labor, but sometimes is performed earlier in pregnancies considered to be high risk. For example, fetal monitoring may be performed in women who have a medical condition such as high blood pressure or diabetes, who have symptoms of preeclampsia (see page 526), or who have had a fetus die before birth (see page 530). The fetus also is monitored if fetal growth is slower than expected or if the pregnancy has passed the due date.\n\nThe simplest techniques for measuring fetal heart rate are ultrasound imaging (which provides a view of the fetus's beating heart) or listening to the heartbeat through a type of stethoscope (called a fetoscope) placed on the women's abdomen.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Fetal Monitoring* > Nonstress test]\nA nonstress test is a noninvasive test done to evaluate the health of the fetus, usually during the last 3 to 4 months of pregnancy. Doctors measure the fetus's heart rate as the fetus moves inside the uterus, making sure that the fetal heart rate increases in response to environmental factors, indicating that the fetus is healthy. If the fetus's heart rate stays the same or decreases, the doctor may recommend further testing, such as a biophysical\n\nprofile (see below). A nonstress test can also be used to measure the frequency of contractions later in a pregnancy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Fetal Monitoring* > Nonstress test]\nIn a nonstress test, one or two instruments attached to belts are placed on the pregnant woman's abdomen. One of the instruments records the fetus's heart rate; the other instrument measures the length, frequency, and relative intensity of contractions.\n\n![Diagram illustrating a nonstress test setup.

The early signs of pregnancy can include missing a period (when you previously have had regular periods); having an unusually light period; having tender, swollen breasts with darkened nipples; feeling nauseated or vomiting (especially in the morning); urinating frequently; having a heavier than usual vaginal discharge; or feeling unusually tired. Some women have cravings or lose their taste for particular foods or have increased sensitivity to odors. The topics discussed in this section can occur at any time during a pregnancy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Health Concerns During Pregnancy > How a woman's body changes during pregnancy]\nDuring the first weeks of pregnancy, a woman's body changes very little, although her breasts may look somewhat larger. By the 12th week, her enlarging uterus may make her abdomen protrude slightly. By the time she is 28 weeks pregnant, her abdomen may be very prominent and her navel may bulge out. Toward the end of the pregnancy, the head of the fetus may move down into the woman's pelvic cavity, making her abdomen appear somewhat less prominent.\n\n![Illustration showing three stages of pregnancy: 12 weeks, 28 weeks, and 40 weeks. The illustration depicts the woman's body and the developing fetus, showing increasing belly size and the fetus's position.]()![](_page_932_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Diet]\nWhat you eat when you're pregnant provides nutrition for your fetus. Eat regular, well-balanced meals that are rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes. To nourish your developing fetus, eat foods that contain essential nutrients such as protein (for cell growth and blood production), calcium (for building strong bones and teeth and developing muscle, heart, and nerve tissue), iron (for producing red blood cells), folic acid (for developing the brain and spinal cord and preventing neural tube defects; see page 398), and zinc (for normal growth and development of the reproductive organs).\n\nMeat, fish, cheese, dried peas and beans, and eggs are excellent sources of protein. Low-fat dairy products are rich in calcium. Good sources of iron include eggs, liver, kidneys, whole-grain or enriched breads and cereals, dried fruit, and green, leafy vegetables. Folic acid is added to breakfast cereals and other grain products and can be obtained from liver, raw green vegetables, and foods that contain yeast. Lean red meat, whole-grain cereals, nuts, peas, and beans are good sources of zinc. Your doctor will probably prescribe vitamins specially formulated for pregnant women. If you are a vegetarian, talk to your doctor and possibly a dietitian to make sure you are getting enough protein and vitamins (particularly vitamins B12 and D) in your diet.\n\nMany women have cravings for particular foods during pregnancy. It's OK to indulge a craving if it's for a nutritious food. High-fat or high-calorie foods can make you gain too much weight, and salty foods can make you retain water. Aversion to certain foods usually is accompanied by nausea or indigestion (see next page). Doctors usually recommend that pregnant women gain about 20 to 30 pounds; gaining too much or too little weight can harm a fetus.\n\nStay well hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Eating fiber-containing foods (such as fresh fruits and vegetables and legumes) can help prevent constipation that can develop from the extra iron you are consuming.\n\nCut back on your caffeine consumption during pregnancy because it can affect sleep and cause cardiac palpitations. Some foods to avoid during pregnancy (because they could harm the fetus) include raw meat, raw eggs, raw fish, and shellfish; unwashed or unpeeled fruits and vegetables (because of pesticide residue); and unpasteurized cheeses and apple juice. No safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy has been established, so you should avoid alcohol entirely throughout your pregnancy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Exercise]\nExercising regularly will keep you in good physical condition and improve your mental state during your pregnancy. It can help control your blood pressure, reduce stress, prevent constipation, tone your muscles, and help you fall asleep. In general, you can continue any exercise you did before you were pregnant as long as it doesn't overtax you or cause excessive straining. Maintain a heart rate of less than 140 beats per minute during exercise. Walking and swimming are good exercises for pregnant women. Avoid strenuous sports and sports in which you or the fetus might be injured. If you are an athlete, your doctor will closely monitor the growth of the fetus and your weight.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Work]\nMany pregnant women continue to work up until labor and delivery.

Get out of bed slowly and sit on the edge of the bed for a minute or two. Try to keep something in your stomach throughout the day. Tell your doctor about the extent of your nausea, especially if it continues or if vomiting is severe. He or she will want to examine you to rule out an underlying condition.\n\nDrinking lots of fluids, especially water, can prevent dehydration. Don't take an antinausea medication unless your doctor has prescribed it. If your vomiting is severe, you may have to be hospitalized and be given fluids and minerals intravenously (through a vein) to replace those you have lost.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Indigestion**]\nIndigestion, often called heartburn, is a burning pain in the center of the upper chest. It is common during pregnancy and affects almost half of all pregnant women. Indigestion occurs during pregnancy because a woman's enlarged abdomen presses on her stomach and esophagus and because the increased level of the female hormone progesterone\n\nduring pregnancy relaxes the muscles in the esophagus that usually prevent the backup of stomach acid. In rare cases, indigestion may be a symptom of polyhydramnios (excess amniotic fluid; see page 526), which puts even more pressure on the abdomen and esophagus. The symptoms of indigestion usually disappear after childbirth unless the indigestion is not related to the pregnancy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Indigestion** > *Prevention and Treatment*]\nTo prevent indigestion, don't eat too much at one time, and avoid highly spiced, greasy, or acidic foods. Eat small, frequent meals. Avoid bending over or lying flat. Try some of the suggestions on page 750 for relieving and preventing indigestion. If these steps don't help, see your doctor. He or she may prescribe an antacid or recommend changes in your diet. If the indigestion persists or is severe, the doctor may order tests to rule out the possibility of a more serious condition.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Indigestion** > **Abdominal Pain**]\nSee your doctor immediately about any abdominal pain during pregnancy. Many women have pain in their abdomen during pregnancy (called round ligament pain) that results from stretching of the ligaments that attach the uterus to the abdominal wall. The pain usually is most severe from the fourth through the sixth month of pregnancy (when the uterus expands most rapidly), but the pain can occur at any time. You can relieve round ligament pain by lying on the aching side. This type of pain usually disappears after childbirth.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Indigestion** > **Urinary Problems**]\nProblems with urination are common in pregnant women. You may urinate more often than usual during pregnancy or feel a strong urge to urinate, which could be caused by hormonal changes and the pressure of your enlarging uterus on the bladder. You may also be thirsty and drink more liquids and therefore excrete more urine than you did before pregnancy. Some pregnant women leak urine (urinary incontinence; see page 877) when they cough or sneeze. Urinary incontinence during pregnancy can result from pressure of the uterus on the bladder and the relaxation of the muscles in the pelvis in preparation for birth.\n\nRelaxation of the pelvic muscles during pregnancy can also lead to urinary tract infections (see page 877), possibly because bacteria can more easily travel up the ureters to the bladder. But urinary tract infections during pregnancy are more likely to be caused by the uterus pressing on the bladder, which makes it more difficult for the bladder to empty completely. If you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection such as painful urination, cloudy urine, or a sore abdomen or back, see your doctor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Fatigue]\nSometimes the first sign of pregnancy is extreme fatigue, which can result from hormonal changes, but may also be caused by anemia (see next page). In addition, as the pregnancy progresses, you are carrying more weight than usual, which can make you more tired. Fatigue is most common during the first and third trimesters. Being pregnant can also cause sleep problems, especially in the last few months, because of discomfort from an enlarging abdomen. Try to rest whenever you can, and get at least 8 hours of sleep every night.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Leg Cramps]\nSome women get sharp pains or cramps in their legs during pregnancy (especially during the last 3 months), possibly from increased pressure of the uterus on the blood vessels that carry blood to the legs, or from a calcium deficiency. These cramps may be followed by dull aching that can last several hours.\n\nTo prevent muscle cramps, take in 1,500 milligrams of calcium every day (either in your diet or in supplements), and stretch your calf muscles before going to bed and first thing in the morning.

Eat citrus fruits and fresh vegetables that contain vitamin C, which helps the body absorb iron more efficiently. Take your prenatal vitamins every day to help ensure that you are getting sufficient amounts of folic acid. Your doctor may prescribe an iron supplement if you are diagnosed with anemia.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Constipation and Hemorrhoids]\nConstipation (see page 769) is common during pregnancy because the increase in hormones can slow the movement of food through the digestive tract. In about the fourth month, constipation sometimes results from pressure on the intestines by the enlarging uterus. Constipation can cause hemorrhoids (see page 777). If you already have hemorrhoids, constipation can worsen them by making you strain harder during bowel movements.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prevention and Treatment*]\nTo prevent constipation, eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and other foods that are high in fiber (see page 37). Drink at least eight glasses of water a day. Some people find prune juice helpful. Don't wait to move your bowels; go whenever you have the urge, but don't strain. Regular exercise can also help keep you regular.\n\nBefore taking any medications for constipation, talk to your doctor. You probably can safely use milk of magnesia or glycerin suppositories while you are pregnant, but don't use other over-the-counter laxatives.\n\nIf none of these measures work, your doctor may prescribe medication to soften your stools. If you have hemorrhoids, take warm baths. Check with your doctor before using any hemorrhoid creams or suppositories.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prevention and Treatment* > Varicose Veins]\nMany women develop swollen veins in their legs (varicose veins; see page 602) during pregnancy, especially during the last 3 months. During pregnancy, the veins are carrying an increased volume of blood to supply to the developing fetus. In addition, as the uterus enlarges and presses on some major veins, blood flow from the leg veins up to the pelvis can slow down. This combination of factors sometimes produces enough pressure to cause the veins in the calves and thighs to become swollen and painful. The same kinds of pressure can also affect the veins around the entrance to the vagina and rectum.\n\nYou are more likely to develop varicose veins during pregnancy if you have a family history of the condition. Varicose veins that develop during pregnancy usually become significantly less swollen or disappear within 12 weeks of delivery.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prevention and Treatment*]\nTo reduce your risk of developing varicose veins, don't wear clothes that fit tightly around your waist or upper legs. Avoid standing for long periods, but take regular walks every day. Rest with your feet up (preferably higher than the level of your heart) as much as possible. Don't gain too much weight during your pregnancy because the excess weight can put more strain on your veins. Your doctor may recommend wearing\n\nelastic support stockings to help improve your circulation. Put the stockings on in the morning before you get out of bed.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sleep Problems]\nMany women find it difficult to get to sleep or stay asleep while they are pregnant. Sleep problems can result from changes in hormone levels, a need to urinate more often, or emotional stress (for example, worrying about your health or the health of your baby). Toward the end of pregnancy, you may find it difficult to find a comfortable position for sleeping. Sleep is essential for good health—for both you and your fetus. Lack of sleep can make you susceptible to infections and can lead to irritability.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Sleep Problems > *Prevention and Treatment*]\nIf you have trouble falling asleep at night, avoid napping during the later part of the day. Take a warm bath and drink a glass of warm milk before going to bed. Because caffeine is a stimulant, cut back on or eliminate coffee, tea, or other caffeine-containing foods or beverages from your diet. Get plenty of exercise during the day, but don't exercise within a few hours of going to bed. Try performing some relaxation exercises (see page 59) at bedtime.\n\nIf you are losing a lot of sleep, talk to your doctor. Most doctors prefer not to prescribe sleep medications such as sedatives because of the possibility of affecting the fetus. This is especially true during the critical first 14 weeks, when the fetus's organs are developing, and in the days closer to the due date, when the medication could suppress the baby's nervous system and affect his or her breathing during labor and delivery. Don't take any medications—including over-the-counter or alternative sleep aids such as the hormone melatonin—unless your doctor has prescribed them.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Back Pai", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "iron", "relation": "treats", "tail": "anemia"}, {"head": "prenatal vitamins", "relation": "helps", "tail": "folic acid"}], "entity_event": [], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

If you have an underlying heart defect such as a congenital heart defect (see page 389), or a heart valve disease caused by rheumatic fever, you have a risk of heart failure. Your doctor should know about any heart conditions before you get pregnant—or at least as soon as the pregnancy is confirmed. Your doctor may refer you to a cardiologist (heart specialist) for additional care during your pregnancy. The cardiologist will monitor your health throughout your pregnancy for any possible complications related to the heart disorder.\n\nSometimes a heart disorder such as a murmur (abnormal heart sounds) shows up for the first time during pregnancy from the extra demands placed on the heart. Most heart murmurs discovered in the first 3 months of pregnancy are insignificant, but the doctor may order tests such as an ultrasound image of the heart (echocardiogram; see page 561) or a recording of the electrical activity of the heart (electrocardiogram; see page 559) to evaluate the condition.\n\nIf you have a heart condition, you will have to deliver in a hospital. If you have no complications, your pregnancy should be healthy and you should go into labor normally at full term. When you go into labor, your doctor will help make sure that the delivery is as easy as possible for you—with a minimum of pushing, which puts a strain on the heart and deprives it of oxygen.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Heart Disorders** > *Treatment*]\nThe main treatment for a heart disorder during pregnancy is rest to reduce strain on the heart, which is already working harder than usual. When you are lying down, keep shifting your position and relaxing and contracting your muscles to keep the blood moving through your legs to prevent blood clots. Restrict your intake of salt and salty foods to prevent fluid retention. Many standard antihypertensive medications have potentially harmful effects on the fetus and usually are not recommended during pregnancy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Heart Disorders** > **Gestational Diabetes**]\nGestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that can develop during pregnancy. The condition can occur because the placenta produces hormones that can block the effects of the hormone insulin, which moves glucose into cells for energy. This insulin-blocking effect usually develops between the 20th and 24th weeks of pregnancy. The pancreas can usually overcome this effect by producing more insulin, but if it cannot make enough insulin to overcome the effects of the insulin-blocking hormones, glucose builds up in the pregnant woman's blood, causing gestational diabetes. The condition goes away after pregnancy because there is no placenta to produce the insulin-blocking hormones.\n\nYou are at increased risk of having gestational diabetes if you are obese, have a family history of diabetes, previously gave birth to a very large infant (weighing more than 9 pounds, 14 ounces), had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy, had a stillbirth (see page 530) or a child with a birth defect, or are older than 25.\n\nWhen diagnosed and treated, gestational diabetes usually does not cause problems for either the pregnant woman or the fetus. If not treated, however, gestational diabetes can produce an excessive amount of amniotic fluid in the uterus (which can stretch the uterus into the abdomen, making breathing difficult) and life-threatening high blood pressure (preeclampsia; see page 526) in the pregnant woman. The fetus may grow very large from the excess glucose in the woman's blood (which can make delivery difficult); after birth, a baby may have low blood sugar, respiratory problems, or neonatal jaundice (see page 382).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Symptoms*]\nGestational diabetes seldom causes symptoms in the early stages. For this reason, all women are offered a glucose screening test (see page 512) during pregnancy. If your blood glucose level is found to be elevated on the screening test, you will then have a more accurate diagnostic test called the glucose tolerance test. For this test, you will be asked to eat a high-carbohydrate diet for 3 days and then to fast overnight (for 10 to 14 hours) before the test. You will be given a strong solution of glucose to drink, and blood samples will be taken and evaluated every hour for 3 hours to determine if you have a high glucose level, indicating gestational diabetes.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nGestational diabetes is usually treated with a carefully controlled diet. If you are diagnosed with gestational diabetes, your doctor will prescribe a diet to help keep your blood glucose level in the normal range. The doctor will probably refer you to a registered dietitian, who can help you plan meals to meet your needs. Most women with gestational diabetes require three meals a day and a bedtime snack.

If the miscarriage occurs later in the pregnancy, the bleeding can range from a few drops of blood to a heavy flow. The bleeding may start with no warning or may be preceded by a brownish discharge. A threatened miscarriage is often painless.\n\nIf the fetus has died, a miscarriage is usually unavoidable (called an inevitable miscarriage). An inevitable miscarriage is usually accompanied by cramping pain in the lower abdomen or back. The pain can be either dull and constant or sharp and intermittent. If you pass any solid tissue from your vagina, save it in a jar to bring to your doctor for examination. The doctor can tell by looking at the tissue if you have eliminated all of the fetus and placenta. He or she will also send the tissue to a laboratory for microscopic examination to try to determine the cause of the miscarriage.\n\nIf any parts of the fetus or placenta remain in the uterus, it is called an incomplete miscarriage. If a miscarriage is incomplete, you may have constant or intermittent bleeding and pain for several days. If an incomplete miscarriage is not diagnosed, the bleeding can continue and the tissue left in the uterus can become infected.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > Vaginal Bleeding During Pregnancy]\nNotify your doctor if you have vaginal bleeding at any time during your pregnancy. Bleeding can be a sign of a serious problem. In early pregnancy, about 20 percent of women have some slight vaginal bleeding, or spotting, such as when the fertilized egg implants in the uterus.\n\nNotify your doctor, call 911 or your local emergency number, or go to a hospital emergency department immediately if you have any vaginal bleeding in the last 6 months of your pregnancy. Bleeding can indicate a miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy. Vaginal bleeding (sometimes called antepartum hemorrhage) after the 20th week of pregnancy, usually in the last 3 months, affects fewer than 2 out of 100 women and may indicate the onset of preterm labor (see page 529), a burst varicose vein, damage to the cervix, placenta previa (see page 527), partial or complete separation of the placenta from the wall of the uterus (placental abruption; see page 527), or another serious complication.\n\nIn rare cases, a fetus dies in the uterus but the woman has no symptoms of miscarriage (called a missed miscarriage). Although you do not have symptoms of a miscarriage in a missed miscarriage, you will no longer experience any of the symptoms of pregnancy. Missed miscarriages are often discovered on a prenatal visit when the doctor notices that the uterus has not increased in size.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > Keeping a Kick Chart]\nAn active fetus is usually a healthy fetus. Your doctor may ask you to keep a record of how active your fetus is with a kick chart. He or she may give you a chart (or you can make a chart yourself) to log the movements of your fetus for a day or two. He or she will ask you to record the kicks at the time of day when your fetus is most active. Discuss the results of the kick chart with your doctor. Healthy fetuses may kick only 10 times a day or kick eight or more times in their most active hour. Keep in mind, however, that the number of movements can vary, and some perfectly healthy babies may not kick much. Also, fetuses move less toward the end of pregnancy, when space is more limited inside the uterus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > WARNING! > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nIf the vaginal bleeding stops or is not very heavy, your doctor may recommend that you rest in bed at home. If the pregnancy seems to be continuing despite the bleeding, your\n\ndoctor may arrange for you to have a series of blood tests to measure the level of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) to confirm that the pregnancy is continuing, and an ultrasound to make sure that the developing fetus is still alive. Don't have sexual intercourse for a few weeks after you have vaginal bleeding because sex can stimulate labor contractions. Ask your doctor about other precautions to take.\n\nNo known medical treatment can stop a threatened miscarriage. If you are having a miscarriage, the doctor may recommend that you rest in bed, or at least stay close to home, until the fetus is expelled. In the case of an inevitable or missed miscarriage, your doctor may remove the fetus and placenta by suction or by a D and C (see page 869). For an incomplete miscarriage, he or she will remove any tissue that remains in the uterus. These procedures are usually performed in a hospital but may be done in the doctor's office or in a clinic.\n\nSome women benefit from short-term psychological counseling after a miscarriage, especially if they were trying to get pregnant. After a miscarriage, you can safely start trying to conceive again in about 6 to 8 weeks.

If the fertilized egg continues to grow inside the tube, it eventually can cause the tube to burst, which can be life-threatening.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the female reproductive system showing the Fallopian tube, Ovary, and Uterus. An inset magnifies the Fallopian tube, labeling it 'Embryo in fallopian tube'.]()![](_page_951_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nIf you have had an ectopic pregnancy, your doctor may recommend waiting until you have had one or two periods before trying to get pregnant again to give your body a chance to heal. Because a woman who has had an ectopic pregnancy is at increased risk of having another one, you will need to have the pregnancy confirmed as early as possible to make sure it is progressing normally (inside the uterus).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Incompetent Cervix]\nIf a woman has an incompetent cervix, her cervix is weak and dilates (widens) under the weight of the fetus and placenta during pregnancy. The fetus and placenta can drop down out of the uterus, resulting in miscarriage (see page 522), usually after the 14th week of pregnancy. The cause of incompetent cervix is usually unknown, but the cervix sometimes can be weakened from past medical procedures such as a biopsy in which a large amount of tissue was taken from the cervix (cone biopsy). Incompetent cervix also can occur in women whose mothers took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) when they were pregnant to prevent miscarriage. (DES was prescribed from the 1940s to the 1970s.)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Incompetent Cervix > Incompetent cervix]\nIf a woman's cervix is weak, the increasing weight of the developing fetus can cause the cervix to open and widen prematurely. As a result, the membranes that surround the fetus may bulge down through the cervix and rupture, causing a miscarriage.\n\n![Diagram of a pregnant uterus showing the fetus, placenta, and cervix. Labels include Placenta, Uterus, Membranes bulging through cervix, and Cervix.]()![](_page_952_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nIf you are pregnant and have had a miscarriage because of an incompetent cervix, or if your doctor thinks that you may have an incompetent cervix, he or she may perform surgery early in your pregnancy to correct the weakness. For this procedure, you will be given spinal or general anesthesia, and the doctor will tighten your cervix using a piece of strong thread. Your doctor may prescribe medication to reduce the risk that the surgery will stimulate preterm labor (see page 529). He or she may recommend that you rest as much as possible and abstain from sexual intercourse until the delivery. At about the 37th week of pregnancy or when you go into labor, the thread is cut to allow the fetus and placenta to pass through the cervix.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Multiple Fetuses]\nTwins occur as a result of either the splitting of a single fertilized egg or the parallel development of two fertilized eggs. Twins account for 1 in 90 births in the United States (triplets, by contrast, are uncommon and occur in only 1 in 8,000 births). Two out of three sets of twins are fraternal (nonidentical), which means that two different eggs from the woman were fertilized by two different sperm from the man. Identical twins develop from one egg, fertilized by one sperm, that splits shortly after fertilization. Fraternal twins each have a placenta; identical twins share a placenta. Identical twins have identical genetic makeup, while fraternal twins are no more alike genetically than other siblings.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Multiple Fetuses > Fraternal and identical twins]\nFraternal twins result when two separate eggs are fertilized by two different sperm. Each twin gets nourishment from his or her own placenta. Identical twins result when a single egg that has been fertilized by one sperm divides into two identical embryos. Identical twins share a placenta.\n\nDiagram illustrating Fraternal (nonidentical) twins. Two separate embryos are shown, each enclosed in its own separate placenta.\n\nPlacenta\n\nFraternal (nonidentical) twins\n\n![](_page_953_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nDiagram illustrating Identical twins.

The outlook is usually good for both the pregnant woman and the fetuses if the woman has adequate prenatal care, rest, and good nutrition. If you are having twins, your doctor may recommend that you take additional vitamin and mineral supplements throughout your pregnancy.

The symptoms of severe preeclampsia include headaches, blurred vision, intolerance to bright light, upper abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and bloating.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Treatment*]\nIf you have preeclampsia, your doctor will recommend that you get lots of rest and reduce your salt intake to help lower your blood pressure. He or she may prescribe a medication to control your blood pressure. The doctor will order ultrasound scans regularly to monitor the fetus's growth and to watch for a buildup of amniotic fluid. If you have symptoms of severe preeclampsia or of eclampsia, you will be admitted to a hospital immediately and will be given medication to lower your blood pressure and remove excess fluid from your body. Your doctor may recommend immediate delivery by inducing labor (see page 533) or performing a cesarean delivery (see page 534).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Placenta Previa and Placental Abruption]\nNormally, the placenta is attached to the top portion of the uterus. Any part of the placenta that is near the cervix (the opening into the uterus) is poorly supported and vulnerable to damage. In placenta previa, the placenta develops low in the uterus, either partially or completely covering the cervix and blocking the entrance to the vagina. The weight of the fetus puts pressure on the part of the placenta that covers the cervix, sometimes causing bleeding if part of the placenta detaches from the wall of the uterus. Placenta previa occurs in about 1 in 200 pregnancies after the 28th week.\n\nThe cause of placenta previa is unknown. It occurs more frequently in women who have given birth to several children and in pregnancies with multiple fetuses (see page 525). In some cases, the placenta is low in the uterus early in pregnancy but then moves up the wall of the uterus to a more normal position as the pregnancy progresses, where it usually does not interfere with delivery.\n\nIf the placenta ruptures or tears, causing heavy bleeding, it can cut off the blood supply to the fetus. In placental abruption, a placenta that is positioned normally in the uterus separates prematurely from the uterine wall. Placental abruption is more common in women who have high blood pressure (see page 520). Placental abruption may be linked to a deficiency of the B vitamin folic acid.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Symptoms]\nPlacenta previa may cause no symptoms. If the placenta becomes partly detached from the uterus, the woman will have sporadic bleeding but usually no pain. Placental abruption may cause some pain along with the bleeding. However, in some cases, placental abruption causes no bleeding because the blood is trapped between the wall\n\nof the uterus and the placenta. This collection of blood can trigger preterm labor (see page 529).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment*]\nIf the placenta is only partially blocking your cervix, your doctor may recommend resting in bed, avoiding sexual intercourse, and limiting other physical activity. He or she will use ultrasound (see page 509) to monitor the health of the fetus and the position of the placenta.\n\nIf you have vaginal bleeding, call your doctor immediately. (Don't try to stop the bleeding by putting in a tampon.) If the bleeding is light or stops on its own and the fetus is not in any danger, your doctor will probably monitor your condition with ultrasound. If the bleeding is severe, you may need to have a blood transfusion, and the baby will be delivered as soon as possible by cesarean (see page 534). Severe bleeding is dangerous but rarely fatal to the pregnant woman, but it can be fatal to the fetus.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Diagnosis and Treatment* > Placenta previa]\nThe normal placement of the placenta is near the top of the uterus. In placenta previa, the placenta is attached at the bottom of the uterus, where it can partially or completely cover the cervix. If the placenta reaches to the edge of the cervix but does not cover it, the condition is called marginal placenta previa (left). In partial placenta previa (center), the placenta blocks part of the cervix. In complete placenta previa (right), the placenta covers the entire cervix.\n\n![Diagram illustrating Marginal placenta previa.

A fetus's growth is determined to be retarded if the fetus's weight falls below the fifth percentile. The inability of the placenta to supply nourishment can result from scarring in areas of the placenta where tissue has died from lack of blood. The obstruction of blood flow can result from preeclampsia (see page 526), high blood pressure (see page 520), vaginal bleeding (see page 523), or placenta previa or placental abruption (see page 527). Retarded fetal growth can also occur when the pregnant woman has a heart disorder (see page 520) or diabetes (see page 521), or when she smokes cigarettes, drinks alcohol or uses other drugs, or is malnourished during pregnancy.\n\nA newborn whose growth is stunted has less body fat (and therefore is less able to resist cold) and is more susceptible to having low blood sugar (hypoglycemia; see page 897) than an infant who is at a normal weight. Low-birth-weight babies have more medical and developmental problems, some of which can be life-threatening. If the infant is preterm (see left), he or she may have complications such as respiratory distress syndrome (see page 381).\n\nTo help ensure that your baby is born healthy, go to all of your scheduled prenatal appointments. If you are beyond the 30th week of your pregnancy and think that your fetus is not moving as much as before, your doctor may recommend that you keep a kick chart (see page 523) to record fetal movements. To monitor the fetus's condition, your doctor may recommend that you have an ultrasound and tests that measure the fetus's heartbeat.\n\nIf your doctor thinks that your fetus's growth may be stunted, he or she will discuss moving up the delivery date by inducing labor (see page 533) or by performing a cesarean (see page 534). A fetus that is not growing normally inside the uterus may do better in a neonatal intensive care unit. Your doctor will recommend that you deliver in a hospital that has a neonatal intensive care unit so that any problems your baby has can be treated promptly by trained neonatal specialists.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Postterm Pregnancy]\nIdeally, labor starts when the fetus is fully mature and able to survive outside the uterus. Most women give birth between the 37th and 42nd weeks of pregnancy. A pregnancy that goes beyond the 42nd week is called a postterm pregnancy, or postmaturity.\n\nPostterm pregnancies occur most frequently in women who have gestational diabetes (see page 521) or a family history of diabetes (see page 894).\n\nA placenta that has been providing nourishment to a fetus for longer than 42 weeks may not be able to provide a large fetus with a sufficient amount of oxygenated blood, which can cause an abnormal heart rate or brain damage. The placenta can also stop functioning normally, reducing the amount of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus or causing the fetus to secrete less urine, thereby reducing the volume of amniotic fluid. Because amniotic fluid provides cushioning between the fetus and the uterine wall, a deficiency of fluid (oligohydramnios; see page 526) can cause the umbilical cord to be squeezed, cutting off the fetus's supply of oxygen and nutrients. Postterm fetuses may be too large to deliver vaginally. In addition, they may be so mature that they excrete their first bowel movement (called meconium) into the amniotic fluid, which can be life-threatening if they inhale the meconium and it blocks their air passages. The death rate of infants who are delivered long after the due date is almost double that of infants who are delivered closer to term.\n\nIf your doctor thinks that your pregnancy is postterm, he or she will use ultrasound and fetal monitoring (see page 533) to ensure that the fetus is healthy. Your doctor will induce labor (see page 533) only if there are medical reasons to do so or if your cervix has started to dilate (widen). He or she will monitor your labor and delivery carefully and, if your baby seems to be in distress, may use forceps or other techniques to assist the delivery or may perform a cesarean delivery (see page 534).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Stillbirth]\nDeath of the fetus, or stillbirth, is the death of a fetus after the 18th week of pregnancy. In many cases, stillbirth results from a severe abnormality in the fetus, severe preeclampsia or eclampsia (see page 526), vaginal bleeding (see page 523), or postterm pregnancy (see left). It is also linked to gestational diabetes (see page 521), high blood pressure (see page 520), Rh incompatibility (see page 508), and infections in the pregnant woman. In many cases, the cause of death is unknown.\n\nIn most cases, the only indication that a fetus has died inside the uterus is lack of fetal movement.

You will be told to push only when you are having a contraction, because the contractions double the effect of your pushing, allowing you to rest between contractions, which helps you conserve energy. An episiotomy (see page 533) may be performed toward the end of the second stage of labor, before the baby's head emerges.\n\nThe second stage of labor ends when the baby is completely out of the vagina. Immediately after birth, the umbilical cord (which has connected the baby to the placenta) is tied and cut. The second stage can last up to 3 hours for a first baby and 2 hours for a subsequent delivery.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Second Stage: Delivery* > **Labor and delivery**]\nDuring the first stage of labor, uterine contractions increase in strength and frequency and move the baby down into the birth canal (top). When the cervix is fully dilated, the contractions become stronger, pushing the baby farther down the birth canal and out of the vagina (bottom).\n\n![Diagram showing a fetus in the uterus, illustrating the position for the baby's head to move through the pelvis during labor.]()![](_page_964_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nConstrictions move the baby's head through the pelvis\n\n![Diagram showing the baby's head emerging through the vaginal opening during labor.]()![](_page_964_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\nBaby's head emerges through the vaginal opening\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Second Stage: Delivery* > *Third Stage: Expelling the Placenta*]\nIn the third stage of labor, after delivery of the baby, the placenta detaches from the uterine wall and is expelled from the uterus (afterbirth). Constrictions (usually less painful than those of labor) help the uterus expel the placenta. Doctors often assist the delivery of the placenta by massaging the woman's abdomen and pulling gently on the umbilical cord during contractions.\n\nThe third stage can last from a few minutes to half an hour. After the placenta has been expelled, the mother may be given medication to prevent excessive bleeding. The doctor cleans and stitches any incisions from the episiotomy (see next page) or tears in the vagina.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Second Stage: Delivery* > **Pain Relief During Labor and Delivery**]\nThe intensity of pain during labor varies significantly from woman to woman and is partly influenced by a woman's expectations. If you are frightened or tense, you may feel pain more acutely. If you attended childbirth classes with your labor coach, you\n\nwill know what to expect and probably will be better prepared to deal with the pain. You can help ease contractions by staying upright and active as long as possible (without tiring yourself out); in addition, gravity helps the baby descend and speeds up dilation of the cervix. Breathe slowly and deeply during and after each contraction. Try a variety of positions to find the ones that are most comfortable.\n\nYou may not need pain relief during labor but, if you do, several options are available. Because some pain relievers can affect the baby's breathing if given late in labor, your doctor may give you pain medication only if the first stage of labor is very painful and if he or she is sure that delivery is not imminent. Medications for pain relief are carefully chosen so that if a baby is delivered soon after the medication is administered, the baby can be given another medication to reverse the effect of the pain medication.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Second Stage: Delivery* > *Pudendal Block*]\nVaginal pain can be relieved by an anesthetic called a pudendal block, which is injected into the tissue of the vagina. A pudendal block is often used just before a forceps delivery (see page 534), or before an episiotomy (see next page), in which an incision is made in the perineum (the skin between the opening of the vagina and the anus) to allow the baby to pass through the vagina more easily.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Second Stage: Delivery* > *Epidural and Spinal Anesthesia*]\nIf your pain is severe, the doctor may recommend epidural (see below) or spinal anesthesia for pain relief. For an epidural, the doctor or an anesthesiologist injects an anesthetic into the space surrounding the spinal cord at the base of the spine (epidural space). The anesthetic is infused through a thin, flexible tube (catheter) to provide small doses of the anesthetic as needed during labor and delivery. An epidural numbs the body from the waist down.\n\nSpinal anesthesia is similar to an epidural except that it is given in one injection, and it paralyzes, not just numbs, the body from the waist down. Spinals are used mostly for cesarean deliveries (see page 534) because vaginal deliveries require the mother to be able to help push the baby through the birth canal.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Second Stage: Delivery* > **Epidural anesthesia**]\nEpidural anesthes", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "contractions", "relation": "double the effect of", "tail": "pushing"}, {"head": "episiotomy", "relation": "may be performed", "tail": "second stage of labor"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "mother", "relation": "having a contraction", "tail": "[Event: second stage]"}, {"head": "baby", "relation": "emerges", "tail": "[Event: end of the second stage]"}, {"head": "umbilical cord", "relation": "tied and cut", "tail": "[Event: immediately after birth]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: episiotomy]", "relation": "may be performed", "tail": "[Event: end of the second stage]"}, {"head": "[Event: contractions]", "relation": "double the effect of", "tail": "[Event: pushing]"}]}, "status": "success"}

An episiotomy is also sometimes performed to avoid irregular tearing of the vagina, which can be more difficult to stitch up than a straight cut. Episiotomies are usually performed toward the end of the second stage of labor, before the baby's head emerges.\n\nAfter injecting a local anesthetic, the doctor usually makes a small, straight cut in the perineum (the area of skin between the opening of the vagina and the anus) from the vagina to the anus; this is called a midline episiotomy. For a mediolateral episiotomy, the cut is made at an angle from the vagina to the left or right of the anus. After delivery, the incision is closed with stitches that gradually dissolve. The incision usually heals rapidly, although the scar may cause discomfort for up to 3 months.\n\nTo relieve discomfort in the area around the incision, your doctor will recommend periodically using an ice pack for a few minutes, sitting in a shallow tub of warm water, or sitting on a doughnut-shaped pillow. To help prevent infection, rinse the area with warm water and pat it dry each time you use the toilet.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Episiotomy]\nIn a midline episiotomy, the incision is made straight from the vagina toward the anus. In a mediolateral episiotomy, the incision is made to the side and at an angle to the anus.\n\nA midline incision is the most common type of episiotomy because it cuts through less tissue and usually causes less discomfort than a mediolateral episiotomy. A mediolateral episiotomy may be necessary if a baby is very large or if forceps are used for delivery.\n\n![Diagram illustrating two types of episiotomy: Midline episiotomy and Mediolateral episiotomy. The diagram shows the baby's head, anus, and the incision site.]()![](_page_969_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Episiotomy > *Forceps*]\nObstetrical forceps are two wide, blunt, curved blades designed to fit around a baby's head to assist delivery. There are several different types of forceps used for different circumstances. For example, they may be used to protect the baby's head in a breech (buttocks first) presentation (see next page) or in a preterm delivery (see page 529). When epidural anesthesia (see page 532) has been used toward the end of labor, forceps are often used to assist delivery because a woman may not feel the urge to push. Forceps also are frequently used if the woman is unable to push or if the baby is showing signs of distress.\n\nAn episiotomy (see previous page) is usually performed before forceps are used, and the woman is usually given a local anesthetic or epidural anesthesia. The doctor inserts the forceps into the vagina along both sides of the baby's head and gently pulls the baby out as the woman pushes with her contractions. The risks of using forceps range from temporary marks on the baby's cheeks or ears to nerve damage or injury to the woman's vagina. Most nerve damage is temporary. A forceps delivery is usually less risky than a cesarean (see below) for both the woman and the baby.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Episiotomy > *Vacuum Extraction*]\nVacuum extraction is sometimes performed as an alternative to forceps delivery. The doctor places a suction cup (which is attached to a vacuum pump) on the baby's head in\n\nthe birth canal. The pump is turned on to secure the baby's head to the cup, and the doctor gently pulls the baby out of the vagina with each contraction.\n\nVacuum extraction poses less risk of vaginal injury than a forceps delivery, although you may still have an episiotomy before delivery. The baby may have slight swelling of his or her scalp from the vacuum cup, but this will disappear in a few days.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Cesarean Delivery*]\nCesarean delivery (also called cesarean section or, for short, C-section) is a surgical procedure in which the baby is delivered through incisions in the wall of the uterus and in the lower abdomen. A cesarean delivery is usually done when it would be safer or easier than a vaginal delivery. Reasons for having a cesarean delivery include having a large baby or multiple babies, prolonged labor or failure of labor to progress, fetal distress, a breech presentation (see next page), or a medical condition the woman has.\n\nIf you have previously delivered a baby by cesarean, you and your doctor will weigh the benefits and risks of having another cesarean delivery. Many women who have delivered a baby by cesarean can later have a successful vaginal delivery. However, there is a risk of uterine rupture at the site of the cesarean incision.\n\nThe preparation for a cesarean delivery is similar to that for other surgical procedures. The incision area is washed and may be shaved, a catheter is inserted into the woman's bladde", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "episiotomy", "relation": "used to avoid", "tail": "irregular tearing of the vagina"}, {"head": "midline episiotomy", "relation": "called a", "tail": "straight cut"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "doctor", "relation": "makes", "tail": "[Event: surgical incision]"}, {"head": "doctor", "relation": "injects", "tail": "[Event: local anesthetic]"}, {"head": "baby's head", "relation": "puts pressure on", "tail": "[Event: delivery]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: forceps delivery]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: episiotomy]"}, {"head": "[Event: irregular tearing of the vagina]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: more difficult to stitch up]"}]}, "status": "success"}

Disproportion can occur in women of any size or height but is more common in small-boned women and in women who are shorter than 5 feet. In some cases, a woman's pelvis is disproportionately small because of a previous injury. Disproportion can also occur if the baby's head is abnormally large, as with babies who have hydrocephalus (see page 400).\n\nIf your doctor suspects that your pelvis may be too small for the baby's head to pass through, he or she will perform an ultrasound of your pelvis. If the disproportion seems severe, the doctor will probably recommend a cesarean delivery (see page 534). If the disproportion is not too severe, he or she may decide to proceed with a vaginal delivery but closely monitor the baby's condition throughout labor.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prolapse of the Umbilical Cord*]\nA prolapsed umbilical cord occurs during (and in rare cases before) delivery when the umbilical cord drops down into the cervix or vagina. A compressed cord can cut off the fetus's blood and oxygen supplies, causing severe damage to or death of the fetus within minutes. A prolapsed cord can occur with conditions such as polyhydramnios (see page 526), breech presentation (see page 535), or premature rupture of the membranes (see page 528). Pressure on the umbilical cord must be relieved immediately, usually by cesarean delivery (see page 534).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prolapse of the Umbilical Cord* > **Prolapsed umbilical cord**]\nA prolapsed umbilical cord is an umbilical cord that has moved into the vagina before the baby's head. A prolapsed cord can become compressed or squeezed and cut off the\n\nbaby's supply of blood and oxygen. An emergency cesarean delivery is usually necessary.\n\n![Diagram of a fetus in the uterus showing the Uterus, Cervix, and Umbilical cord.]()![](_page_974_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prolapse of the Umbilical Cord* > *Excessive Bleeding After Delivery*]\nPostpartum hemorrhage is excessive loss of blood from the uterus or vagina after delivery. Bleeding often occurs when the uterine contractions are not strong enough to enable the uterus to shrink back to its original shape and compress the blood vessels in the uterus. (The contractions limit bleeding caused by the separation of the placenta from the uterus.) The muscles of the uterus may be weakened by an unusually long labor or stretched excessively by multiple fetuses or by multiple previous deliveries. Bleeding also can result when fragments of the placenta remain inside the uterus and prevent it from contracting sufficiently after childbirth. Excessive bleeding can also occur if the vagina was torn during delivery.\n\nBleeding from the uterus can be controlled with medications that stimulate the uterus to contract. If fragments of placenta remain inside the uterus, they will be removed. If the bleeding has resulted from torn vaginal tissues, the tear will be closed with stitches after the area has been numbed with a local anesthetic. Bleeding that is life-threatening may require surgical removal of the uterus (hysterectomy; see page 870).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prolapse of the Umbilical Cord* > *Retained Placenta*]\nThe placenta usually separates easily from the wall of the uterus after delivery. The doctor may assist the separation of the placenta by pressing on the woman's abdomen (which helps the uterus contract) while at the same time pulling gently on the umbilical cord. Massaging the abdomen not only helps the uterus contract but also helps stop bleeding. Occasionally the placenta becomes trapped inside the uterus if it doesn't separate completely from the uterine wall. A retained placenta is a placenta that hasn't been expelled within 30 minutes of delivery.\n\nA retained placenta is removed by the doctor. After giving you an anesthetic, the doctor will reach inside your uterus with his or her hand and remove the placenta. You will then be given medication to help your uterus contract and prevent excessive bleeding.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Prolapse of the Umbilical Cord* > Delivering the placenta]\nThe uterus continues to contract after delivery until the placenta (afterbirth) is delivered, completing the third and final stage of labor. To help expel the placenta, the doctor massages the woman's abdomen and, while the uterine contractions push the placenta out, the doctor gently pulls on the umbilical cord (which is attached to the placenta).\n\n![Diagram illustrating the delivery of the placenta.

Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. Your choice will be based mostly on your personal preferences and your lifestyle. Feeding your baby, whether by breast or bottle, is an important time for you to form a strong emotional attachment to your baby, which is just as essential to your baby's growth and development as nutrition.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > **Feeding Your Baby** > *Breastfeeding*]\nFor various reasons, not all women want to (or can) breastfeed. However, breastfeeding has many benefits for both mother and child. Doctors recommend\n\nbreastfeeding as the most beneficial nutrition for babies in their first year of life. Breast milk provides the perfect mix of nutrients that infants need to develop properly, and it causes fewer food allergies and fewer digestive problems (such as constipation) than formula. Breast milk also provides a newborn with infection-fighting antibodies from the mother's body and reduces the incidence of ear, respiratory, and digestive tract infections during the first few years of life. Breastfeeding is convenient because breast milk is always available and requires no preparation, and you can feed your baby whenever he or she is hungry. Breastfed babies do not gain weight as quickly as bottled babies, and breastfed babies seldom become overweight.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Breastfeeding]\nThe hormone prolactin, which stimulates milk production, is produced by the pituitary gland in the brain. After childbirth, the pituitary gland releases prolactin into the mother's bloodstream, where it stimulates milk production. When a baby sucks on the breast, the stimulation from the sucking sends a signal to the pituitary gland to release more prolactin to trigger milk production. Milk flows from the milk-producing glands at the back of the breast into tiny sacs called milk ducts under the woman's areola (the darker area surrounding the nipple). The pressure of the baby's mouth on the areola squeezes milk from the milk ducts out through the nipple. Feeding a baby alternately from both breasts helps ensure that both breasts receive equal stimulation to produce an equal amount of milk.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the process of breastfeeding. (1) The baby's sucking sends a signal to the pituitary to release more prolactin. (2) The pituitary gland releases prolactin. (3) Prolactin triggers milk production. Milk flows from the milk-producing glands at the back of the breast into tiny sacs called milk ducts under the woman's areola.]()![](_page_979_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\nFor the mother, breastfeeding helps the uterus get back to its normal size more quickly. Also, because you are burning calories when you breastfeed, you will lose weight faster. Breastfeeding longer than 3 months confers some protection to women against developing breast cancer later in life.\n\nIf you have any problems in the first few days of breastfeeding, don't be discouraged. Talk to your doctor and to friends who have breastfed and ask for tips. Call or attend group meetings of the local La Leche League, a volunteer group that offers practical advice and encouragement to women who are breastfeeding.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Breastfeeding > ***Bottle-Feeding***]\nMany women choose to bottle-feed their babies. If this is your choice, you should not feel guilty that you are depriving your baby in any way. Formula provides the nutrients your infant needs to develop and grow, and you bond with your baby when you hold him or her for feedings. Make sure that you prepare the formula according to the package instructions. Some people prefer the convenience of bottle-feeding because other people can help out with feedings. It also gives the father and older siblings an opportunity to participate in feedings and form their own attachment to the baby.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Breastfeeding > ***Bottle-Feeding*** > **Bottle-feeding**]\nBottle-feeding can give other people, particularly fathers, a chance to feed and bond with a baby. A baby who fusses soon after sucking on a bottle may be having trouble with the nipple or formula. Make sure that the hole in the nipple is not clogged or too small and that the formula is not too hot.\n\n![A black and white illustration of a man, likely a father, sitting and feeding a baby from a bottle.]()![](_page_981_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Postpartum Depression]\nMany women feel blue during the first few days after childbirth. This is normal. New mothers usually are very tired. First-time mothers may be afraid, anxious, or overwhelmed by their new responsibilities and challenges.

At the turn of the 20th century, life expectancy in the United States was only 46. Today, life expectancy is approaching 80, an astounding 75 percent increase in one century, greater than at any other time in history.\n\nStill, death is inevitable, and for many of us, it is a process that occurs slowly over a period of weeks or months. Unlike a sudden, unexpected death, a slow death can give a dying person and his or her family and friends the opportunity to come to terms with death (and to prepare for it).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Dying and Death > The 10 Leading Causes of Death in the United States]\nFollowing are the 10 leading causes of death in the United States in 2000.\n\nThe information comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n1. Heart disease\n2. Cancer\n3. Stroke\n4. Chronic lower respiratory disease\n5. Accidents\n6. Diabetes\n7. Pneumonia and influenza\n8. Alzheimer's disease\n9. Kidney disease\n10. Blood poisoning\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Dying and Death > Terminal Illness]\nA terminally ill person should decide the timing and extent of any discussion about death, including organ donation or funeral arrangements. If a terminally ill person asks questions about dying, he or she may have, to some extent, already come to terms with it. Once the person has brought up the subject of death, it can be easier to talk about specific aspects of his or her death. Some terminally ill people want to know the facts about their condition, while others prefer to know as little as possible. Try to gauge how much the dying person wants to know.\n\nThe person's doctor, family, and friends need to be compassionate when talking about death because it is essential to maintain a degree of hope. This does not mean, however, that you should encourage false hopes of recovery, which could cause the person to lose confidence in his or her doctors or miss the opportunity to say good-bye to loved ones or put his or her affairs in order.\n\nSometimes a person who is terminally ill or his or her family members or friends may find it easier to talk about death with someone who is not emotionally involved in the situation. In such cases, it can be helpful to seek counseling from a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist or from a member of the clergy.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Organ Donation]\nThe need for donated organs far surpasses the supply, and the waiting lists are long. But only a fraction of people who could donate organs actually do. The decision to donate vital organs after death for transplantation is a difficult one. Organ donation, however, ensures that the donor will make a lasting and meaningful gift that can help a critically ill person live a longer, healthier life.\n\nAgreeing to the surgical removal of one or more organs or parts of organs after death can be done by the dying person or his or her family members. Most organs are removed immediately after death. The heart, lungs, liver, pancreas, kidneys, eyes, and skin are some of the organs that can be successfully transplanted after death. A person may also want to donate his or her whole body for medical education or research.\n\nIf you decide to donate your organs or body after death, you must sign a donor card, which you can obtain from a local hospital, health department, library, driver's license facility, or an organization such as the Red Cross. Ask a family member to also sign the donor card. You should make your intentions about organ donation clear to your relatives and doctor because a signed donor card alone is not enough to guarantee that your wishes will be carried out. All states require the permission of a close family member after death (even if the deceased person has a signed donor card).\n\nThe acceptability of a body or organ can be determined only at the time of death. Older people may be able to donate only parts of their body (such as their eyes), but medical schools accept bodies of any age for research. To be a donor, the person has to be of sound mind and 18 years old or older, although, with parental consent, a person under 18 can be a donor. Donations are considered gifts; it is illegal to pay for a donated body or body part. However, transporting the body after death is the financial responsibility of the family or estate, whether the body is transported to a hospital or medical school for donation or to a funeral parlor.\n\nOrgan donation is performed with respect for the donor's body, using standard surgical practices. It does not violate the beliefs of most religions, or affect funeral practices, including the option of an open casket. And in the case of whole-body donation, not having the body at a memorial service can change the emphasis of the ceremony to the person's life (rather than his or her death).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Advance Directives]\nAt some", "response": {"entity_entity": [], "entity_event": [{"head": "person", "relation": "come to terms with", "tail": "[Event: death]"}, {"head": "family and friends", "relation": "prepare for", "tail": "[Event: death]"}], "event_event": []}, "status": "success"}

This is especially true if the caregiving is not excessively demanding or complicated. For people who may require complex care, the family may still want to care for the person at home during the last few weeks of his or her life. In general, hospitals are better equipped to treat people who are acutely ill than people who are\n\nterminally ill. At home, a terminally ill person can remain more independent, participate in family life, and avoid feelings of loneliness and isolation.\n\nIf a family member plans to care for a terminally ill relative at home, regular visits from the doctor, along with support from other family members and friends, are essential. The family should consider using the services of visiting nurses if they are available in their community. Many hospitals offer palliative services that provide support for people who are caring for a terminally ill person at home.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Advance Directives > *Controlling Pain*]\nPain is the most feared symptom associated with terminal illness. Continuous pain over a long period can wear a person down emotionally and physically and undermine his or her ability to cope. Pain control, which is the responsibility of a person's doctor and caregivers, enhances the quality of the person's life during the terminal phase of an illness.\n\nAlthough some families express concern that a terminally ill person will become addicted to pain medication, drug addiction is not a realistic concern in the last few weeks of a person's life. Cutting back on pain medication can result in inadequate pain relief and needless suffering. Keeping a terminally ill person as pain-free as possible should be the major goal.\n\nDoctors often prescribe long-acting morphine to control the pain of a terminal illness such as cancer. If pain recurs between doses, the doctor may also prescribe a shorter-acting form of the drug or another pain reliever to use between doses of the longer-acting medication. If pain medication is prescribed on an as-needed basis, the medication should be given as soon as the person becomes uncomfortable. It is important to give pain medication on a regular basis to ensure continuous pain relief. Once pain begins to worsen, it is more difficult to control. To keep pain under control, medication is usually given around the clock, not just when a person asks for it. If the person is taking pain medication and is still in pain, talk to the doctor or the visiting nurse about adjusting the dosage.\n\nOther pain-relief methods (including relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, guided imagery, and massage) can be used along with medication to help control pain and improve a dying person's sense of well-being. In general, the earlier a person begins to use relaxation techniques and massage for pain relief, the more effective these methods are likely to be.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Process of Dying]\nThe term dying refers to the process in which the body's systems shut down and prepare for death. It is difficult to estimate how long the dying process will take. The actual moment of death is often very peaceful.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Process of Dying > *Nutrition and Elimination*]\nOne sign of dying is decreased food consumption and increased weight loss. If the person can (and wants to) eat, give him or her soft foods that won't cause choking. The person may not be hungry or thirsty and may gradually withdraw from food or may refuse to eat or drink. Moisten his or her mouth by giving ice chips to suck on or by wetting his or her mouth with a wet cloth. Don't force the person to eat or drink. Swallowing may be difficult. Urine output will start to decrease because the person is not drinking enough fluid, and he or she will have few bowel movements because of decreased food intake and movement. Keep the dying person clean and dry by using incontinence pads or disposable briefs and changing them when they are soiled.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Process of Dying > *Circulation*]\nCirculation will slow, and the person's pulse will grow weaker. The underside of the body may become darker in color as blood begins to pool. The person's arms and legs may be cold and look bluish purple. If the dying person feels chilled, keep him or her covered with blankets. (Don't use electric blankets because of the possibility of causing burns.) Keep the room comfortable and not too warm.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Process of Dying > *Agitation*]\nA person who is dying may become agitated, especially just before death. The agitation may be a sign not of pain but of discomfort. The person may become more and more restless. He or she may pull at the sheets, have trouble sleeping, continuously fidget, and even groan.

Some may, for a time, go on with their life as if nothing has happened, until they are eventually overcome by intense grief. Grief is an essential process that cannot be rushed.\n\nDuring the period immediately following a death, delusions of seeing the person are common. There is a tendency to forget that the person is dead and even act as if he or she were still alive. It is also common to idealize the dead person and feel guilty for not doing more for the person when he or she was alive. Guilt and intense grief occur frequently when a person has died unexpectedly. When death occurs after a long illness, the bereaved person has usually been able to anticipate the loss and may have been able to provide care, which can lessen feelings of guilt and grief. Also, it is normal for close friends or family members to feel relief once the death has occurred, especially if the death was a long, difficult, or painful one. This sense of relief is normal, and they should not feel guilty about it.\n\nThe intensity of grief lessens over time, although the amount of time varies from person to person and depends on the closeness of the relationship. Usually after about 6 weeks, grief will slowly be replaced by a more general lack of feeling or depression that will become much less intense after a year or so. By then, most bereaved people have recovered from their loss and have returned, more or less, to their previous life. However, feelings of grief may reappear at unpredictable times in the years that follow.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Mourning Process > *Coping With Grief*]\nSome people think that no one ever really gets over a death but that we just learn to adapt to the loss. If someone close to you has died, try to acknowledge the loss. Don't try to forget about the death or put it out of your mind. Talk about the dead person to relatives and friends. Express your feelings openly; cry if it helps.\n\nTo help yourself recover from the loss of someone close to you, try to meet new people and continue to engage in your favorite activities. Stay involved with groups or organizations that have been sources of support. Reading books about the grieving process may help you cope. For many people, sorting out the person's possessions can help them come to terms with the death. For others, the task is very painful and they delay it for as long as possible.\n\nGive yourself time to accept your loss, acknowledge your feelings of grief, and then begin to rebuild your life through positive interests and new relationships. You will begin to think less about your loss and focus more on happy memories of your loved one.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Physical Symptoms of Grief]\nPeople tend to forget that there is a physical side to grief as well as an emotional one. Some physical manifestations of grief can include insomnia or sleeping excessively, upset stomach or lost appetite, headache, fatigue, and muscle aches.\n\nLosing sleep and not exercising or eating properly can jeopardize your health. Try to get sufficient sleep and eat regular, nutritious meals. Don't use medication for depression or sleep loss unless it has been prescribed by your doctor, and never use drugs or alcohol to cope with the stress of losing a loved one. Exercise not only benefits your physical health but also helps relieve depression by releasing hormones called endorphins, which have a pain-relieving and soothing effect on the body.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > *Coping With the Death of a Child*]\nThe death of a child can cause more anger and grief than the death of an adult. We experience extreme distress, partly because we may feel that the child has not experienced enough of life. If the child died suddenly, it is often even more difficult to bear than if the death occurred after a long illness. Professional counseling is almost always necessary for parents, siblings, and other close relatives such as grandparents. Support groups or group therapy with other parents and children who have had similar experiences can be a great comfort.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Dying Child]\nA child may be able to face the prospect of his or her own death better than his or her parents can. A child may fear pain and, if admission to the hospital is necessary, separation from his or her parents more than he or she fears death. It will usually help a child come to terms with death if he or she is told about the illness. Death should not be treated as a forbidden subject. The most important thing that parents can give their child is security—physical security by their presence, and emotional security by their loving support.\n\nIt is important for a terminally ill child to lead as normal a life as possible for as long as possible.

About once every minute, the heart pumps at least 9 pints of blood through the entire circulatory system.\n\nThe arteries carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the tissues. The main arteries branch into smaller arteries called arterioles, which branch to form tiny capillaries, the smallest blood vessels in the body. Capillary walls are only one cell thick, allowing oxygen and other vital nutrients in the blood to pass through the walls to nourish the tissues and allowing waste to be taken up by the capillaries for removal. The capillaries returning to the heart gradually become larger, forming tiny blood vessels called venules, which gradually become larger and form veins. The veins carry oxygen-depleted blood through organs such as the kidneys and liver, which remove waste, and through the lungs, which provide a fresh supply of oxygen. From the lungs, the veins carry the blood back to the heart, where the cycle of circulation begins again.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > Disorders of the Heart and Circulation > Heart Disorders]\nTo function properly, your heart requires a constant supply of blood, which provides oxygen and other nutrients to the heart muscle. Three major coronary arteries and a network of smaller blood vessels on the surface of the heart supply blood to the heart muscle. The walls of healthy arteries are muscular, smooth, and elastic to allow blood to flow through them easily. Heart disease, also called coronary artery disease, develops when the coronary arteries become narrowed, reducing or blocking the flow of blood (and oxygen and other nutrients) to the heart. This narrowing of the arteries is usually caused by atherosclerosis, a gradual thickening and hardening of artery walls caused by buildup of a fatty substance called plaque. Over a\n\nlifetime, plaque can grow larger and the artery walls can become thicker, making the channel inside the artery narrower and potentially blocking blood flow.\n\nIn atherosclerosis, the heart has to pump harder and faster to push blood through the narrowed arteries, causing high blood pressure (see page 574). The reduced supply of oxygen to the heart muscle can cause pain in the chest called angina. In some people, the heart muscle is damaged and its pumping action weakened, causing heart failure (see page 570).\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Heart and Blood Vessels > The Heart]\nThe heart is a muscular organ made up of two pumps, each divided into two sections that are linked by valves. The larger section is the left ventricle, which pumps oxygen-rich blood through the aorta to all parts of the body. The blood then returns to the heart, entering the right atrium through two large channels (superior vena cava and inferior vena cava). From the right atrium the blood passes through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. It is then pumped through the pulmonary artery into the lungs, where it eliminates carbon dioxide and takes up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood flows back to the left atrium of the heart through the pulmonary veins. From the left atrium it passes through the mitral valve into the left ventricle, where the cycle begins again.\n\n[OLDER PEOPLE > The Heart and Blood Vessels > Coronary arteries]\nOxygen-rich blood is pumped out of the aorta and flows into the coronary arteries, a branching network of blood vessels on the surface of the heart that supply oxygen- and nutrient-rich blood to the heart muscle.\n\nDiagram illustrating the major blood vessels and valves of the heart and their connections to the lungs and body.\n\n- **Aorta (sends oxygen-rich blood from heart to rest of body)**\n- **Superior vena cava (returns oxygen-depleted blood from head and upper body to heart)**\n- **Right atrium (receives oxygen-depleted blood from superior vena cava and inferior vena cava)**\n- **Tricuspid valve (allows oxygen-depleted blood to flow from right atrium to right ventricle)**\n- **Inferior vena cava (brings oxygen-depleted blood from lower body and legs to heart)**\n- **Pulmonary artery (carries oxygen-depleted blood from right ventricle to lungs)**\n- **Pulmonary valve (controls flow of oxygen-depleted blood from right ventricle into pulmonary artery)**\n- **Pulmonary veins (carry oxygen-rich blood from lungs to left atrium)**\n- **Left atrium (receives oxygen-rich blood from lungs through pulmonary veins)**\n- **Aortic valve (controls flow of oxygen-rich blood from left ventricle into aorta)**\n- **Mitral valve (allows oxygen-rich blood to flow from left atrium to left ventricle)**\n- **Left ventricle (pumps oxygen-rich blood from heart into aorta)**\n- **Right ventricle (pumps o", "response": {"entity_entity": [{"head": "heart", "relation": "consists of", "tail": "circulatory system"}, {"head": "arteries", "relation": "carry", "tail": "oxygen-rich blood"}, {"head": "capillaries", "relation": "allow", "tail": "oxygen and other substances"}], "entity_event": [{"head": "heart", "relation": "beats", "tail": "[Event: moves blood continuously around the body]"}, {"head": "heart", "relation": "pumps", "tail": "[Event: at least 9 pints of blood through the entire circulatory system]"}], "event_event": [{"head": "[Event: beats]", "relation": "leads to", "tail": "[Event: moves blood continuously around the body]"}, {"head": "[Event: pumps]", "relation": "causes", "tail": "[Event: at least 9 pints of blood through the entire circulatory system]"}]}, "status": "success"}
